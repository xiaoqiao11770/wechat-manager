= Shell =

"""Runs an external command."""

The Shell ROP runs an external command, either directly or in a shell.
Running a command directly does not support basic shell redirection or
piping, however, it is much easier to interrupt.


@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons/]


    == Shell ==

        Command:
            #channels: /command

            The command to execute.
        Execute in a Shell:
            #channels: /shellexec

            Running a command in a shell allows I/O redirection and
            other shell features to work. However, interrupting a render
            in the middle of a shell command will stop the Houdini
            render process, but the shell command will continue until it
            is finished.

            If off, the command will be run directly, which is much
            easier to interrupt. If you don't need shell features, this
            is the recommended way to run external commands.


    == Scripts ==

        Pre-Render Script:
            Execute this script before any rendering.
        Pre-Frame Script:
            Execute this script before each frame.
        Post-Frame Script:
            Execute this script after each frame.
        Post-Render Script:
            Execute this script after all rendering.
@locals
    N:
        Frame being rendered.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
