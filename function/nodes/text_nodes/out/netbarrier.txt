"""Blocks the ROP network until synchronization occurs."""

The Net Barrier uses the tracker to ensure multiple machines stay in
step with each other.  This is useful if some external shared drive is
being used to transfer data and you need to make sure that the
machines don't out pace each other.

@parameters

[Include:standard#render_buttons]

[Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

Port:
    The port specified when starting the simtracker.py process for
    communication.
Address:
    What machine will run the simtracker.py process for synchronization.
    If this is blank, no attempt at synchronization or data transfer
    will occur.
Job Name:
    The job name to describe this synchronization or data exchange
    event.  By using different job names one can have machines part of
    separate data-exchange and synchronization events.
Mode:
    Synchronize:
	Cooking is blocked until the given number of peers report into
	the tracker that they are done.  Then they are all allowed to
	continue.  Useful if you have a bunch of machines you need to
	operate in lock step.
    Post Barrier Value:
	The given synchronization value is posted as the current
	barrier value for the job name.  The machine is allowed to
	continue unimpeded.  This is useful for a producer machine
	whose output other machines depend on, but which can operate
	as fast as it wishes.
    Wait Barrier Value:
	Waits for the barrier value stored in the job name to reach
	the synchronization value.  Then it is allowed to continue.
	This is useful to ensure consumer machines do not outpace the
	producers.

Peer:
    The slice number that this machine should report itself as.  Each
    machine connecting under the job name should have its own unique
    slice number.  Sometimes this can be inferred from the operation
    so this parameter will be absent.
Number of Peers:
    Total number of machines that have to synchronize.  Sometimes this
    can be determined from the operation so this parameter will be
    absent.
Synchronization Value:
    The barrier value to post, if in post mode, or to wait for, if in
    wait mode.

@locals

N:
    Frame being rendered.

NRENDER:
    Total number of frames being rendered.
