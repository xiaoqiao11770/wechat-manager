= Merge =

"""Merges several render dependencies into one."""

The Merge ROP takes several dependencies and merges them into one
dependency. It has no other effect; it is mostly a wiring convenience.

NOTE:
    As Merge has no effect, bypassing a merge also has no effect.
    Locking a merge will still stop upstream renders, however.

NOTE:
    Set the incoming [Mantra ROPs|Node:out/ifd] to __Render Frame Range Only (strict)__, in order to render the correct frame range. 

@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons_only/]

@locals
    N:
        Frame being rendered.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
