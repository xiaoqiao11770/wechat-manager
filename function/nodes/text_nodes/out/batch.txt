"""Renders the input ROP in a single batch job."""

The Batch ROP renders its input ROP as a single job. It will render all
its frames in order, from the first to the last, without rendering any
other ROPs. This is most useful for particle simulations and other
highly order-dependent sequences that are rendered most optimally in
sequence.


@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons_only/]

    Always Render Input's Full Frame Range:
        If on, regardless of the frame range being rendered, the input
        ROP is rendered over its entire frame range. If off, only the
        portion of its frame range that is requested by the render is
        rendered. If the input ROP does not have a frame range
        specified, this has no effect; the requested range is used.
@locals
    N:
        Frame being rendered.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
