"""This output operator is used to drive the image3d program which
generates 3D texture maps."""

This output operator is used to drive the image3d program which
generates 3D texture maps. The operator sets up all necessary options
and then invokes the program.


@parameters
    Render:
        Begins the render.
    Frame Range:
        Allows specification of a range of frames to render.
    Start/End/Inc:
        Specifies the first & last frames and the increment. Note that
        when rendering a sequence of images with a fraction Inc, `$N` is
        the number of the frame rendered, `$F` is the nearest integer
        frame number, `$FF` is the floating point frame number.
    Output Image:
        Name of the 3D texture to generate.

    [Include:standard#mkpath]

    Resolution:
        Resolution (in X, Y and Z) of the 3D texture.
    SHOP:
        The SHOP which controls the parameters for the texture
        generation.
    Verbose:
        Generation statistics will be printed out.
    Render As:
        Some SHOPs require particle or metaball geometry to run
        properly. The clipped options allow you to override the bounding
        box of the geometry with your own. The options are:

        No geometry:
            No geometry is sent to i3dgen.
        Meta/Particle:
            Send particles/metaballs.
        Raw Point:
            Interpret points as particles.
    Initialize Sim:
        Dynamic simulations will be initialized.
    Object/SOP:
        Choose the object/SOP to specify the geometry.
    Particle scale:
        An additional multiplier to particle scale. This is primarily
        useful when sending down raw points.
    Displace Bound:
        Enlarge the bounding box by this amount.
    Min/Max Bounds:
        The bounding box of the 3D texture.
    Oversampling:
        Anti-aliasing controls in texture generation.
    Variance:
        Threshold for anti-aliasing levels.
@locals
    N:
        The current frame of the range specified. This always starts at
        1.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
