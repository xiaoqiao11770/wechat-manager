"""This output operator is used to write an MDD animation file."""

This output operator is used to write an MDD animation file based on point
locations in a particular geometry. The number of points in the geometry must
not change, and the frame range must monotonically increase.

@parameters

    [Include:standard#render_buttons/]

    [Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

    SOP Path:
	The SOP node which contains the points used to write the file.

    Output File:
	Name of the MDD file to write.

    Rest Frame:
	Specifies the frame at which to cook the rest geometry.

    Transform:
	Specifies whether the geometry should be transformed into world space
	before written out.

    Scale:
	Specifies a scale on the geometry before written out.

    Coordinate System:
	The coordinate system used in the MDD file. If this is set to
	Right-Handed, z coordinates will be negated upon writing from
	Houdini's native left-handed coordinate system.

    Relative Time Values:
	If set, time values will be written out relative to the starting
	frame.

	TIP:
	    To import an MDD file that was saved with this option enabled, the
	    _Frame_ parameter of the [Node:sop/mdd] surface node should use the
	    expression `$FF+1-`_start frame_ instead of `$FF`. For sequences
	    starting at frame 1 though, this is not necessary.

    [Include:standard#mkpath]

    Initialize Simulation OPs:
        Force all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
        Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.

        This is the safest way to render out a simulation, because it
        starts the simulation from scratch and discards any partial
        simulations you might have done with different parameters.

@locals

    N:
	The current frame of the range specified. This always starts at 1.
    NRENDER:
	Total number of frames being rendered.
