"""The SubNetwork output operator provides an easy way to manage large
number of output operators."""

The SubNetwork output operator provides an easy way to manage large
number of output operators. It can also be used to render the output
operators inside it.

A subnet ROP renders any final ROPs inside it (ROPs that do not have
outputs). If more than one final ROP exists, they will be rendered in
arbitrary order. To enforce an order, add a [Merge ROP|Node:out/merge] and wire the ROPs into it in the desired order.

Bypassing a subnet will also bypass the rendering of all its contained
ROPs.

NOTE:
    Any input dependencies to the subnet are applied to any contained
    ROPs that do not have inputs.
