"""Generates geometry files from a SOP or DOP network."""

@parameters

Save to Disk:
    #id: execute

    Saves the geometry to disk with the last control settings.

Save to Disk in Background:
    #id: executebackground

    Starts another copy of Houdini in the background and instructs that
    copy to cook and save the geometry.  This allows one to continue working
    and load the .bgeo files as they complete.

Controls...:
    #id: renderdialog

    Opens the control dialog to allow adjustments of the render parameters
    before rendering.

[Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

Start/End/Inc:
    Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive. 

    These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

	`$NRENDER`:
	    The number of frames to be rendered by the output driver.
	`$N`:
	    The current frame being rendered (starting at 1 and going to `$NRENDER`).

Render with Take:
    #id: take

    Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
    __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

parameters id="render_buttons_only">>
Save to Disk:
    #id: execute
SOP Path:
    The SOP node, object, or SOP subnet to render from.
    
Output File:
    The file to save the geometry to (should end in `.geo` or
    `.bgeo`). Make sure to  [include $F in the
    filename|/render/expressions]  to write out separate
    files for each frame.
    
Transform:
    Specifies whether the geometry should be transformed into world space
    before written out.
    
[Include:standard#mkpath]

Initialize Simulation OPs:
    Forces all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
    Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.

    This is the safest way to render out a simulation, because it
    starts the simulation from scratch and discards any partial
    simulations you might have done with different parameters.

Alfred Style Progress:
    A percentage complete value is printed out as files are
    written. This is in the style expected by Pixar's Alfred
    render queue.

Report Network Use:
    The number of bytes sent or received by the distributed simulation
    primitives during the cooks triggered by this geometry output is
    printed.
    
    This does not track use by, for example, saving a file to an NFS mount.
    It only tracks the network communication of nodes such as the Gas Net
    Exchange Border DOP.

Save Retries:
    If saving the geometry to disk fails due to a disk writing error,
    Houdini will usually error the output node immediately.  This
    is desirable for most cases where a failure to save means an
    illegal path, which is not recoverable.  However, sometimes files
    fail to save due to network issues.  If the number of save retries
    is non-zero, Houdini will re-attempt to save this number of times.
    Each time will be accompanied with an output to the console of the
    failure to save and a five second wait in the hopes that the network will
    clear up.

Save in Background:
    When saving more than one frame, save in a background thread. This can
    make saving faster for large file sizes, but may use more memory since it
    will retain the output geometry until the save completes.

[Include:standard#scripts_tab]
    Post-Write Script:
        Run this HScript after each frame's data has finished
	writing to disk.  This is always after the corresponding Post-Frame
	Script and always before teh Post-Render script, but the order
	otherwise is undefined.  When Save in Background is enabled
	this allows delaying script actions until the file has finished
	saving.

@locals

N:
    Frame being rendered.

NRENDER:
    Total number of frames being rendered.
