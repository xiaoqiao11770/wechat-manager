parameters id="render_buttons">>
    Render:
        #id: execute

        Begins the render with the last render control settings.
    Render Control:
        #id: renderdialog

        Opens the render control dialog to allow adjustments of the
        render parameters before rendering.
    Render with Take:
        #id: take

        Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
        __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

parameters id="render_buttons_only">>
    Render:
        #id: execute

        Begins the render with the last render control settings.
    Render Control:
        #id: renderdialog

        Opens the render control dialog to allow adjustments of the
        render parameters before rendering.

== Standard == (standard_tab)

    Camera:
        The camera to render the scene from.
    Visible Objects:
        Space-separated list of objects which will be rendered. Use `*`
        to render all objects (the default). You can use wildcards (for
        example `prop_*`) and  [bundle references|/basics/bundles]
        to specify objects.
    Visible atmosphere:
        Space-separated list of atmosphere objects which will be
        rendered. Use `*` to render all atmosphere objects (the
        default). You can use wildcards (for example `fog_*`) and
        [bundle references|/basics/bundles]  to specify atmosphere
        objects.
    Active Lights:
        Space-separated list of lights which will illuminate the scene.
        Use `*` to use all lights. You can use wildcards (for example
        `key_*`) and  [bundle references|/basics/bundles]  to specify
        lights.
    Unload SOPs:
        Unload SOP geometry after used by the render.
    Output Picture:
        The picture or device to be rendered.
    Image Format:
        The file format (for example, Houdini pic) of the rendered
        image.
    Valid frame range:
        #id: valid_frame_range
        
        Limits the rendering of frames, when set to __Render frame range__
        or __Render frame range only__.


        Render any frame:
            Allow the renderer to render any and all frames.
        Render frame range:
            Only render the frames in the range set below, but allow the
            renderer to render other frames if they are referenced by
            in-range frames.
        Render frame range only (strict):
            Only render the frames in the range set below, and don't
            allow the renderer to render other frames, even if they are
            referenced by in-range frames.
    Initialize Sim. SOPs:
        Force all simulation SOPs to be reset.
    Generate Script File:
        Outputs an .ifd file instead of piping the script to mantra.
    Binary Script File:
        Toggles between ascii and binary file formats.
    Script File:
        Filename of the .ifd file.
    Render Command:
        The command used to invoke the renderer. Can be modified with
        the popup window.
    Render in Background:
        Continue to use Houdini while rendering.
    Super Sample:
        Controls quality of anti-aliasing.
    Decouple Ray Sample:
        Specify an alternate sampling rate for ray tracing. Ray sampling
        will use this value as a maximum sampling rate, and will take
        fewer samples if there is low variance.

        NOTE:
            Decoupled ray sampling is only meaningful for micropolygon
            rendering. It will be ignored when mantra is run in ray
            tracing mode.

    Resolution:
        Override camera resolution with values specified.
    Pixel Aspect:
        Override camera pixel aspect ratio.
    Fields:
        Control for rendering video fields.
    Motion Blur:
        Specifies whether motion blur is allowed. If set to set to
        disallow, motion blur is globally turned off regardless of
        individual object settings.
    Motion Blur Type:
        The default motion blur type for rendering. This can be
        overridden by an individual object.
    Depth of Field:
        Turn on rendering of depth of field effects.
    Jitter:
        Limits the amount of jitter. A value of 0 will result in no jitter.
    Dither:
        Controls the amount of dithering performed.
    Gamma:
        Gamma correction factor used.

== Scripts == (scripts_tab)

    Pre-Render Script:
        Run this script before any rendering.
    Pre-Frame Script:
        Run this script before each frame.
    Post-Frame Script:
        Run this script after each frame.
    Post-Render Script:
        Run this script after all rendering.

parameters id="mkpath_parms">>
    Create Intermediate Directories:
        #id: soho_mkpath
        
        Create intermediate parent directories for output files as needed. This currently only applies to generated scripts, images, and shadow maps.
