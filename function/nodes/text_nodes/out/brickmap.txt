"""Allows you to convert Houdini volume primitives into Pixar brickmap files."""

Pixar's RenderMan has a brickmap file format similar to Houdini's i3d (Image 3D) files. The Brick Map Generator ROP allows you to convert Houdini volume primitives into Pixar brickmap files. The Brick Map Generator ROP is a wrapper around the `hbrickmap` command line tool.

@parameters

[Include:standard#render_buttons/]

[Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

Start/End/Inc:
    Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive. 
    
    These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.
        `$NRENDER`:
            The number of frames to be rendered by the output driver.
        `$N`:
            The current frame being rendered (starting at 1 and going to `$NRENDER`).

Output File:
    Name of the brickmap to generate.

[Include:standard#mkpath]

Operation:
    What type of source geometry to convert to a brickmap file. This can be either and `.i3d` file on disk, a disk file containing volume primitives, or a SOP containing volume primitives.

I3D File:
    Source i3d file to convert to a brickmap file.

Geometry File:
    Source geometry file to convert to a brickmap file.

SOP:
    Volume geometry SOP to to convert to a brickmap file.

Point Cloud File:
    Store the intermediate Point Cloud file (in Pixar's .ptc format).

Volume Filter:
    The filter used when evaluating volume primitives.

Volume Filter Width: 
    The filter width used when evaluating volume primitives.

Create Os from Density: 
    Automatically create the Os channel in the brickmap based on the density channel in the volume primitive/i3d file.
