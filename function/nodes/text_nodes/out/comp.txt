"""The Composite output operator renders the image(s) produced in the
Compositing Editor."""

The Composite output operator renders the image(s) produced in the
Compositing Editor.

Arguments may be passed to the scripts and variable expansion is done
before calling the script.


@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons/]

    Set Valid Frame Range:
        If on, the render is only valid between the start and end
        frames, at the specified frame increment. If a frame is outside
        the range, or falls on a frame that isn't included by the frame
        increment, the frame will not be rendered.

        If off, the render is valid at any frame.

        NOTE:
            If you want to temporarily set a sub-range to render, use
            the 'Frame Range' parameter in the Render Control dialog
            (click the 'Render Control...' button at the top of this
            dialog).


    == Composite ==

        COP Name:
            Path to the COP to render.
        Override Default Res:
            Allows specification of the rendered resolution.
        Resolution:
            Resolution of rendered images.
        Output Picture:
            Selects where the output is sent.
        Image Format:
            The format to write the image in.

	[Include:standard#mkpath]

        Color Plane:
            Plane to use as the RGB channels.
        Alpha Plane:
            Plane to use as the A channel (in RGBA image).
	Convert to Image Format's Colorspace:
	    Image data in COPs is always linear. When writing to image formats
            that are not linear (sRGB, for example), this will convert the 
            colorspace to preserve the look of the image. An 8bit format that
            has an unspecified colorspace is assumed to be sRGB.
        Output Gamma:
            Gamma correction that is applied to saved images.
        Output Frames Reused in Composite:
            When on, this tells the compositor that output frames
            may be read back in during the same composite. This disables
            threaded file writes and batch frame cooking. By default,
            this is off.
        Batch Cook Frames:
            If on, the compositor cooks frames in groups, rather than
            individually. This can improve output performance on
            multi-processor platforms (there is generally no difference
            for single processor machines). Groups of two frames are
            recommended when using this option, as the performance gain
            drops off quickly for larger groups. This option generally
            uses a bit more memory (instead of a buffer for one file,
            several are allocated).

            Batch cooking speeds up processing of small to medium sized
            networks, which spend a higher percentage of their time
            preparing to cook a frame and writing the output image.

        Reload All Files:
            If on, any composite nodes referencing files (such as a
            File COP) will reload their files. Enable this option if
            files are being replaced on disk between renders.

    == Image Area ==

        Output Area:
            Defines the area to be written to the file. Some file
            formats support data windows and crop areas (TIFF, Open EXR,
            pic), which allow you to write portions of an image or extra
            bordering information. In all cases, the image is written at
            the resolution specified, but the data window written may be
            different.

            If a format does not support a data window or crop region,
            the image area requested will be clipped against the image
            frame. Any data outside the crop region will be black.


            Frame:
                The normal image frame area is used, which is what you
                normally see in the viewport. No data window or crop
                region is written.
            Crop Region:
                Only data in the crop region is written. All other
                pixels are set to black. For image formats supporting
                crop regions, a crop region is set in the file (so it
                takes up less disk space).
            Frame + Surrounding Canvas:
                This option allows you to write extra image data outside
                the frame area, so that you can use it when compositing.
                If the canvas size is less than or equal to the frame
                area, the frame area is written. In other words, this
                only differs from the "Frame" option if the COP has a
                large canvas.
        Pixel / UV Crop:
            Specifies the crop region, in either pixels or UV coords.
            The fields represent the lower and upper corners of the
            region (left, bottom, right, top).
        Limit Canvas Pixels:
            If on, the extra canvas information written to the file is
            limited to this many pixels beyond the frame area. This
            prevents very large files from being written, and generally
            gives you the most useful data.
        Limit Canvas Percent:
            If on, the extra canvas information written to the file is
            limited to a percentage of the horizontal or vertical
            resolution. So, for a 640x480 image, limiting to 10% will
            write a maximum of 64 pixels on the left and right, and 48
            pixels on the top and bottom.

    == Auxiliary File 1-5 ==

        Overview:
            Save additional images which allows separation of planes
