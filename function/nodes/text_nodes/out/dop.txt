""" Saves the state of a DOP network simulation into files. """

The Dynamics output driver generates simulation state (`.sim`) files
from a dynamics (DOP) network. Each file contains the complete state of
the simulation for a certain frame. You can then read the state back
into the network using a [File DOP|Node:dop/file].  You can also
directly point to a sequence of these files in the Files to Play
parameter of the [Dopnet Object|Node:obj/dopnet] or [Dopnet SOP|Node:sop/dopnet].

Saved state files are a persistent cache of a simulation. You can move
these files around to run the simulation in one place and use the
results in another. For example, you can use the hscript standalone
utility to run a simulation on a renderfarm and save out state files,
then play the simulation back locally by loading the state files with a
File DOP. This would let you run multiple versions of a simulation on
the renderfarm overnight and compare the results the next day.


@parameters
    Save to Disk:
        #id: execute

        Saves the simulation to disk as a sequence of .sim files.

    Save to Disk in Background:
	#id: executebackground

	Starts another copy of Houdini in the background and instructs that
	copy to save out the simulation as a sequence of .sim files.  This
	allows one to continue working and load the .sim files as they
	complete.

    [Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

    Start/End/Inc:
	Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive. 

	These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

	    `$NRENDER`:
		The number of frames to be rendered by the output driver.
	    `$N`:
		The current frame being rendered (starting at 1 and going to `$NRENDER`).

    Render with Take:
        #id: take

        Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
        __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

    DOP Path:
        The DOP network to render from. (You can point to a DOP within a
        DOP network, but Houdini saves the state of the entire
        network.)
    Output File:
        The file to save the simulation state to. Make sure to  [include
        $SF in the filename|/render/expressions]  to write out
        separate files for each frame.

    Output Every Sim Frame Using $SF:
	Every single simulation frame will be output, rather than just
	the frames hit by the step rate of the frame range.  In this
	mode one just has to set the entire range without worrying
	about how substepping will be set up.

	$SF should be used instead of $F in the file name in these
	cases.

    [Include:standard#mkpath]

    Initialize Simulation OPs:
        Force all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
        Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.

        This is the safest way to render out a simulation, because it
        starts the simulation from scratch and discards any partial
        simulations you might have done with different parameters.
        However, throwing away an already-cooked simulation can be
        expensive, especially for relatively slow solvers such as
        fluids.

    Compress .sim Files:
	Determines if .sim files written to disk for caching will be
	compressed.  GZip can provide the best compression, but is
	incredibly slow.  Blosc provides excellent compression and
	speed so should usually be used.

    Alfred Style Progress:
	A percentage complete value is printed out as files are
	written. This is in the style expected by Pixar's Alfred
	render queue.
