= Switch =

"""Renders one of several inputs."""

The Switch ROP controls render dependency flow by selecting one input to
render. The index may be animated.

Switch is often used to select one of several similar renders such as a
fast preview render or a final, detailed render. It can also be used to
dynamically lock a branch by selecting the branch, or no input).

NOTE:
    Bypassing a switch causes all input dependencies to be passed
    through to its outputs.


TIP:
    To render none of the inputs, use a number that doesn't correspond
    to any input such as -1 or 10000.


@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons_only/]

    Input Index:
        #channels: /index

        Specifies the input to select, starting at 0. If this is set to -1, the Switch ROP will not pass through any input.

@locals
    N:
        Frame being rendered.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
