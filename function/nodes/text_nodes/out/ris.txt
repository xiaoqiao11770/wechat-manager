= RenderMan RIS =

"""Renders the scene using Pixar’s RenderMan renderer in RIS mode."""

This output operator is used to drive the RenderMan rendering program. The operator sets up all necessary options, including a `soho_rismode` parameter that puts RenderMan into RIS rendering mode, and then invokes the renderer. Alternatively, the output can be saved to disk as a script file to be rendered later.

Please refer to the standard [RenderMan driver|rib] for information about the
parameters.
