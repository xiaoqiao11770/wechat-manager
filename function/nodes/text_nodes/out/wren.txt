"""This output operator is used to drive the Wren rendering program."""

This output operator is the wireframe renderer. The
operator sets up all necessary options and then invokes the renderer.
Alternatively, the output can be saved to disk as a script file to be
rendered later.

When rendering postscript, the width and height of the image represent
the width and height of the "paper" (in inches). Thus to render
landscape mode, the width should be set to 11 and the height set to 8.5.
The postscript options can be set by clicking the + button beside the
render command.

Arguments may be passed to the script and variable expansion is done
before calling the script.

NOTE:
    The Wren ROP uses the `linewidth` attribute, if present, to determine the width of the line.

TIP:
    To render files readable by Adobe, you need to use the paper width and height options.

@parameters
    [Include:standard#render_buttons/]

    Valid Frame Range:
        If on, the render is only valid between the start and end
        frames, at the specified frame increment. If a frame is outside
        the range, or falls on a frame that isn't included by the frame
        increment, the frame will not be rendered.

        If off, the render is valid at any frame.

        NOTE:
            If you want to temporarily set a sub-range to render, use
            the 'Frame Range' parameter in the Render Control dialog
            (click the __Render Control...__ button at the top of this
            dialog).
    Output Picture:
        Where the output of the render should be directed.
    Camera:
        Which camera to render the scene from.
    Visible Objects:
        List of objects visible in the rendered scene.
    Unload SOPs:
        Unload SOP geometry after used by the render.
    Use Display SOP:
        Use the display (instead of render) SOP.

    [Include:standard#mkpath]

    Initialize Simulation OPs:
        Forces all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
        Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.
    Generate Script File:
        Outputs the renderer's script file instead of feeding the data
        to the renderer directly.
    Binary Script File:
        Toggles between ascii and binary file formats.
    Script File:
        Filename of the script file to create.
    Render Command:
        The command used to invoke the renderer. Can be modified with
        the popup window.
    Render in Background:
        Continue to use Houdini while rendering.
    Super Sample:
        Number of rays sent per pixel in x and y when antialiasing.
    Override Camera Res:
        Allows specification of the render resolution.
    Resolution:
        Resolution to render at.
    Pixel Aspect:
        Specifies pixel aspect ratio of the intended viewing device.
    Jitter:
        Limits the amount of jitter. A value of 0 will not produce any jitter.
    Pre-Render Script:
        Execute this script before any rendering.
    Pre-Frame Script:
        Execute this script before each frame
    Post-Frame Script:
        Execute this script after each frame
    Post-Render Script:
        Execute this script after all rendering
@locals
    N:
        The current frame of the range specified. This always starts at
        1.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
