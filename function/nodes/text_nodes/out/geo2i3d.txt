"""Converts .bgeo and .geo volumes into .i3d"""

This simple HDA can be used to convert .bgeo volumes into .i3d.  While Mantra
can render .bgeo files directly, .i3d provides some superior sampling options.

It only supports outputting a single channel, density, from the volume
sequence.  However, you can unlock this asset and dive inside it to
hook up additional channels if needed.

The recommended workflow is to render with .bgeo directly.  If you are concerned about space, see the [Volume Compress SOP|Node:sop/volumecompress] for some ways to reduce the size of .bgeo volumes.

@parameters

[Include:standard#render_buttons]

[Include:standard#valid_frame_range]

Input Geometry:
    The file sequence of .bgeo or .geo to convert to .i3d.
    
Primitive Number:
    The primitive in the .bgeo sequence that should be considered a volume
    and converted to the density channel of the .i3d.

Output Image:
    The name of the output sequence of .i3ds.
    
[Include:standard#mkpath]

Resolution:
    The .i3d is built in an axis aligned space independent of the volume's
    orientation or resolution.  This specifies the sampling rate for the .i3d.

Min Bounds:
    The bottom left corner of the bounding box for .i3d generation.

Max Bounds:
    The top right corner of the bounding box for the .i3d generation.

[Include:standard#scripts_tab]

@locals

N:
    Frame being rendered.

NRENDER:
    Total number of frames being rendered.
