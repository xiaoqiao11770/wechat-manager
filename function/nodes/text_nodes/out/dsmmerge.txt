Merged Output:
    The resulting merged file.

Opacity Limit:
    In a DSM/DCM file, each pixel in the file records the
    opacity at all z-depths.  This parameter allows records beyond
    a threshold to be culled during the merging process by
    chopping all records beyond an accumulated opacity in a pixel.

Compositing:
    Controls whether samples are pre-composited or uncomposited on output.
    The default is to go by what the inputs themselves specify.
    
Input Files:
    The number of DSM/DCM files to merge.

Source File 1:
    The first input DSM/DCM.
