= Fetch =

"""Makes a dependency link to a ROP in a different network."""

The Fetch ROP allows dependency rendering to include ROPs that are not in 
the same ROP network. The ROP source is included in the dependency tree as if
it was wired directly to all the Fetch ROP's outputs. The ROP source may
have its own dependents and they will be rendered as well.

If this node is bypassed, it will be as if the source ROP was disconnected and
nothing will be rendered.

@parameters

       The path to the ROP that will be inserted into the dependency tree.

@locals
