"""Does nothing."""

The Null ROP does nothing. It acts simply as a placeholder to make
wiring networks easier, or allow you to reference a single output ROP
without having to update all the references to it.

NOTE:
    As Null has no effect, bypassing a null also has no effect. However, locking
    a null will still stop upstream renders.
