"""Combing allows you to interactively orient the normals of your
geometry."""

Combing allows you to interactively orient the normals of your geometry.

As you move the mouse over the geometry, you will see a circular brush
follow the surface to show where you would comb. The size of this brush
and its orientation will show you which points will be affected by a
comb operation.

Like all the brush tools, you have two different brushes: your
Foreground brush and your Background brush. You comb with your
foreground brush using the ((LMB)) and the background with the ((MMB)).

Each of the brushes also can have its own independent operation. To
select the operation for each brush, ((Ctrl + RMB)) to bring up the operation
menu. The options are:

* Comb Normals: In this mode, the normals of your geometry will tilt in
  the direction your brush is dragged.

* Smooth Normals: The normals under the brush are smoothed out to remove
  any sudden changes in their direction.

* Erase Changes: Thus is a local undo - it restores the normals under
  your brush to the pre-comb values.

* Lift Normals: The normals under the brush are tilted away from the surface
  by the lift parameter value.

* Rotate Normals: The normals under the brush are rotated about the true
  surface normal by the brushed direction.

The other main parameters are:

* Comb Lift: How flat the normals should lie on the surface. 0 is flat
  on the surface, 1 is standing upright, and -1 standing downright.

* Radius: The size of the brush.

* Opacity: How strong the brush is. A fully opaque brush replaces the
  original normal, while a less opaque brush blends it.

The other ((Ctrl + RMB)) Menu options are:

* Circle/Square/Bitmap Brush: The shape of the brush. The bitmap is set
  in the operation parameters dialog.

* Orient Brush To Surface: When disabled, the brush is always oriented
  the same way. This is useful when combing crinkly geometry.

* Accumulate to Stencil: This advanced option is described in more
  detail in the manual.
