"""The select operation lets you preselect geometry for the next
operation."""

The select operation lets you preselect geometry for the next
operation.

The normal way to model in Houdini is to first choose the operation you
would like to perform and then select the geometry on which to perform
that operation (verb - noun). The select state allows you to preselect
some geometry that will be used for the next operation to perform.

== General Notes ==

    NOTE:
        These apply to both the Select OP and the selection stage of
        other Operations.

    == Selection Types ==

        The  [selection icons|/basics/select]  on the left side of the
        Viewport let you change the type of selection (e.g. points,
        primitives, edges, etc.) The ((1))- ((9)) keys can also be used
        to change the selection type.

    == Selection Mode ==

        The default selection mode is "replace" mode, where newly
        selected geometry replaces the current selection. To quickly use
        "toggle" mode while in "replace", hold the shift key while
        selecting. While in "toggle" mode, clicking on already selected
        geometry will remove it from the selection, and clicking on
        unselected geometry will add it to the selection. The selection
        mode can be changed to "replace", "toggle", "add", or "remove"
        by clicking on the menu at the left hand side of the viewer.

    == Box / Lasso / Paint Picking ==

        The default selection style is "box picking". This means that
        clicking and dragging the mouse will draw a box, and the current
        selection rule will be applied to everything in the box. The
        selection style can be changed to "box picking", "lasso
        picking", or "paint picking" via the menu to the left of the
        viewer. Lasso picking lets you draw freehand selection regions.
        Paint picking lets you drag the mouse over geometry to select or
        unselect it. While paint picking, the left-mouse-button uses
        "replace" mode, Shift-left-mouse-button uses "add" mode, and the
        middle-mouse-button uses "remove" mode.

    == Select Whole Geometry ==

        The "select whole geometry" toggle at the left of the viewer
        lets you pick an entire geometry object by clicking on any part
        of it. The keyboard shortcut for this toggle is ((-)).

    == Front / Back Polygon Menu ==

        The "front/back polygon" menu at the left of the viewer lets you
        select front and back facing polygons, only front facing
        polygons, or only back facing polygons. This menu is useful when
        working in the UV viewer.

    == Non-dragable Selecting ==

        Some operations, like transform and edit, let you select
        geometry and drag it while in selection mode. The moment you
        drag the geometry Houdini exits selection mode and begins to
        change the parameters of the current operation in order to drag
        the geometry. If you do not want to accidentally drag geometry,
        use the ((MMB)) to select it instead of
        the ((LMB)).

== Select Operation Menu ==

    == Select All ==

        Selects all the object / scene geometry (depending on the status
        of Select From All Objects).

    == Toggle Selection ==

        Unselects that which is selected, and selects that which was
        formerly _not_ selected.

    == Select None ==

        Deselects everything.

    == Select From All Objects ==

        Normally, you work on the contents of one object within your
        scene at a time. Enabling this allows you to select from all the
        objects in your scene. Picking geometry from other objects will
        create object merges.

        This is tied to the Select One/All icon at the bottom of the
        Viewport.
