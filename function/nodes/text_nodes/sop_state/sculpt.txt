"""The Sculpt Operation allows you to interactively sculpt the shape of
your geometry."""

The Sculpt Operation allows you to interactively sculpt the shape of
your geometry.

As you move the mouse over the geometry, you will see a circular brush
follow the surface to show where you would sculpt. The size of this
brush and its orientation will show you which points will be affected by
a sculpt operation.

Like all the brush tools, you have two different brushes: your
Foreground brush and your Background brush. You sculpt with your
foreground brush using the ((LMB)) and the background with the ((MMB)). The
amount sculpted is controlled by the __FD__ and __BD__ parameters
respectively.

Each of the brushes also can have its own independent operation. To
select the operation for each brush, ((Ctrl + RMB)) to bring up the operation
menu. The options are:

* Deform Points: This moves each point under your brush along its normal
  by the amount of your brush's current displacement (__FD__ or __BD__).

* Smooth Points: This averages out the brushed points positions creating
  a smoother geometry.

* Deform and Smooth: This combination operation will first deform the
  points, and then post-smooth them.

* Erase Changes: Thus is a local undo - it restores the points under
  your brush to the pre-sculpt values.

The other main parameters are:

* Radius: The size of the brush.

* Opacity: How strong the brush is. A fully opaque brush moves the point
  by the full displacement, while a less opaque brush does less.

The other Ctrl-RMB Menu options are:

* Circle/Square/Bitmap Brush: The shape of the brush. The bitmap is set
  in the operation parameters dialog.

* Orient Brush To Surface: When disabled, the brush is always oriented
  the same way. This is useful when sculpting crinkly geometry.

* Accumulate to Stencil: This advanced option is described in more
  detail in the manual.
