"""The Edit operation allows fast, interactive editing of geometry."""

The Edit operation allows fast, interactive editing of geometry.

This operation is best for quick, repeated edits, since only one [Edit|Node:sop/edit]
node will be created in the network. This differs from most other
operations, like [Transform|Node:sop/xform], that create new nodes for each new
operation.

Use of the Edit operation will result in cleaner, more compact networks,
in addition to improved overall performance. On the other hand, Edit
operations are not animatable, and past edits cannot be modified
procedurally.

To maintain a history of operations, or to animate operations, use
[Transform|Node:sop/xform], [Soft Transform|Node:sop/softxform], [Peak|Node:sop/peak], or [Soft Peak|Node:sop/softpeak] instead.

Please see the [Edit SOP|Node:sop/edit] help for more information.

Keyboard Shortcuts (See ((Ctrl + RMB)) menu for full list):

* `${h.pane.gview.state.sop.edit.toggle}`: Toggle between Transform mode and Peak mode 
* `${h.pane.gview.state.sop.edit.flatten}`: Flatten the currently
selected geometry to the construction plane.

NOTE: 
        Often you will want to quickly modify geometry by repeatedly clicking 
        and dragging freely. For this type of work, make sure the
        __Secure Selection__ button on the left is turned off. 

        This will allow 
        you to avoid pressing `${h.pane.gview.repeat_current}` to start a new 
        operation.

As a special feature of the Edit operation, you can toggle the handle
quickly without clicking its icon on the left side. 

Repeatedly pressing
the following keys will toggle the handle on and off:

* `${h.pane.gview.handle.xform.translate}`: Toggle Translate handle
* `${h.pane.gview.handle.xform.rotate}`: Toggle Rotate handle
* `${h.pane.gview.handle.xform.scale}`: Toggle Scale handle
* `${h.pane.gview.handle.edit.peak}`: Toggle Peak handle
