"""The UVBrush operation allows you to interactively manipulate the
texture coordinates of your geometry."""

The UVBrush operation allows you to interactively manipulate the texture
coordinates of your geometry.

As you move the mouse over the geometry, in the UV viewport you will see
a circular brush follow the surface to show where you would paint. The
size of this brush and its orientation will show you which points will
be affected by a brush operation.

Like all the brush tools, you have two different brushes: your
Foreground brush and your Background brush. You brush with your
foreground brush using the LMB and the background with the ((MMB)). The
dilation factor is controlled by the __FS__ and __BS__ parameters
respectively.

Each of the brushes also can have its own independent operation. To
select the operation for each brush, ((Ctrl + RMB)) to bring up the operation
menu. The options are:

* Drag: This drags the uv textures in the direction of the brush
  stroke.

* Dilate/Contract: This uses the dilation factor (either __FS__ or __BS__) to
  enlarge or reduce the area under the brush. UV Textures are moved away
  or towards the center of the brush.

* Smooth: This smoothly blends the textures coordinates. Boundary
  points are left unchanged.

* Erase Changes: Thus is a local undo - it restores the positions under
  your brush to the pre-uvbrush values.

The other main parameters are:

* Radius: The size of the brush.

* Opacity: How strong the brush is. A fully opaque brush replaces the
  original positions, while a less opaque brush blends it.

The other ((Ctrl + RMB)) menu options are:

* Circle/Square/Bitmap Brush: The shape of the brush. The bitmap is set
  in the operation parameters dialog.

* Orient Brush To Surface: When disabled, the brush is always oriented
  the same way. This is useful when painting crinkly geometry.
