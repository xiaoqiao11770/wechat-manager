= Blend Sticky =

"""Computes its transform by blending between the transforms of two or more sticky objects, allowing you to blend a position across a polygonal surface."""

== Overview ==

The [Sticky object|Node:obj/sticky] computes its transform from a UV position
on a polygonal surface. Blend Sticky blends between two or more Sticky objects
to get a new transform that still follows the surface. You can weight each
input.

All inputs to this object must be Sticky objects, and all Sticky objects
must be sticking to the same surface.

@parameters

== Sticky Blend  ==

    Attribute:
        The attribute name of the texture to use for the polygonal
        parameterization.
        
    Orient To Surface:
        Whether the local orientation of the point should be used. Uses the
        surface normal as the Z axis and the texture's U axis as the Y axis.
        
    Fetch World Transform:
        Uses the transform of the input Sticky geometry. If this is off,
        uses the parent transform of the Sticky Blend node.
        
    Wrap in U/V:
        Wraps U and V values outside the __U/V range__.
        When this is off, the node ignores out of range U and V values.
        
    U/V Range:
        The range of valid U/V values. Values outside this range will either
        wrap or be ignored, depending on the __Wrap in U/V__ setting.
        
    Assume UV Coordinates Unchanging:
        When this is on, the node saves time by not regenerating its cache
        of the target surface's texture coordinates. Only turn this off if
        the target surface has animated geometry.
    
    Clear UV Caches:
        Forces this node to regenerate its cache of the the target surface's
        texture coordinates. This node is conservative about rebuilding the
        cache, so you may need to use this if you change the geometry of the
        target surface. For animated geometry, turn off the 
        __Assume UV Coordinates Unchanging__.
    
    Weights:
        The weight assigned to each input sticky object. Higher weights move
        the blended point closer to that sticky object.
