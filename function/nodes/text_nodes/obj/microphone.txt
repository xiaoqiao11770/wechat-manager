= Microphone =

"""The Microphone object specifies a listening point for the
SpatialAudio CHOP."""

The Microphone object specifies a listening point for the SpatialAudio
CHOP. Multiple microphones can be used by one SpatialAudio CHOP to
create stereo or surround sound, with special effects like the doppler
effect, volume loss over distance, obstacle interference, atmospheric
filtering and positional audio.

To set up a Spatial Audio scene, one or more Sound objects should be
used to emit sound. At least one microphone is needed to capture the
sound. A SpatialAudio CHOP is needed to render the sound. If any
obstacles or filters are used, at least one Acoustic CHOP is needed to
design the spectrum filter.

Moving Sound and Microphone objects around will produce variations in
pitch and volume, especially if either object is directional. Setting up
a directional microphone or sound object is much like setting up a
directional light.

    == Microphone ==

        Microphone Active:
            Turns the microphone on (if greater than zero) or off.

        Sensitivity:
            The volume gain of the microphone.

        Directional:
            If off, the microphone is non-directional and accepts sounds
            from all directional equally. Otherwise, the microphone is
            directional and pointed down the negative Z axis. The
            recording cone and outer cone parameters determine the field
            of recording. Any sounds within the recording cone have a
            gain defined by the sensitivity (above). Any sounds outside
            the outer cone have a gain defined by the outer sensitivity
            parameter (below). Any sound between the recording cone and
            the outer cone have a gain that is interpolated between the
            two sensitivities.

        Recording Cone:
            Defines the angle of the recording cone, measured from the
            Z axis to the edge of the cone. Setting this to 180 degrees
            will make a non-directional microphone.

        Outer Cone:
            Defines the dropoff region from the recording cone to the
            outer cone. If the recording cone is set to 60 degrees and
            the outer cone is set to 20 degrees, any sounds coming from
            more than 80 degrees off the Z axis will fall outside the
            outer cone.

        Dropoff:
            Sets the interpolation type for the dropoff from the
            recording cone sensitivity to the outer sensitivity.

        Dropoff Rate:
            Increases or decreases the rate of dropoff.

        Outer Sensitivity:
            The gain that is applied to any sounds coming from outside
            the outer cone.

        Filter CHOP:
            Specifies an optional CHOP that defines the frequency
            response of the microphone. The filter should be a channel
            named "absorb", designed by an Acoustic CHOP.
