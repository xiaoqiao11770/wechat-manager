= Null =

"""Serves as a place-holder in the scene, usually for parenting. this object
does not render."""

The Null Object serves as a place-holder in a scene, and does not
render. It can be used to designate a place in the space of your scene,
or as a "look at" object to help coordinate a camera's movement and
field of view.

The Null Object is also used as an End Affector for constructing chains
of bones. Its parameters are similar to those of the Geometry Object's
Transform and Miscellaneous tabs.

To change the null's display geometry, go inside the node (Alt-click the
icon in the network editor or select it and press ((I))) and edit the
SOPs defining its shape.

You can use the Null Object's transform to define coordinate systems in
either RIB or IFD renderings using the controls on the Render tab.

    == Render ==

        [Include:common#display]

        Output transform as render space (RIB/IFD):
            If this parameter is turned on, then the transform of the
            null will be output to render scripts as a named transform
            space. As well, the pre-include and post-include will be
            enabled for inclusion into the render stream. Note that the
            display of the object must be turned on and the null must
            match the visible objects of the output driver.

    == Misc ==
