= Switcher =

"""Acts as a camera but switches between the views from other cameras."""

Wire multiple Camera objects into this node's input, then set or animate the
__Switch Camera__ parameter to control which camera's view the switcher node
passes through. Use this switcher as the "camera" for a render node to
render the switches.

This object acts like a regular Houdini camera, except that it gets all
of its parameters (including transforms) from the input camera. This node
has its own rotoscoping options.

    == Render ==

        Switch Camera:
            #channels: /camswitch

            Determines which camera to view through - All of the
            transform and viewing - parameters of the input camera are
            used.

        Display:
            Whether or not this object is displayed. Turn on the checkbox to have Houdini     use this parameter, then set the value to 0 to hide the object, or 1 to show the object. If the checkbox is off, Houdini ignores the value. To see the object in the viewport you must fist create a geometry for viewing. To do this dive into the switcher node and add a geometry such a a sphere. You will now be able to see the active camera with a sphere around it.
