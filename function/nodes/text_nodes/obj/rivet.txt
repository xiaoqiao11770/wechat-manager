= Rivet =

"""Creates a rivet on an objects surface, usually for parenting."""

The Rivet Object gets its world transform from the surface of another
object. This tool is useful for attaching objects to deforming surfaces
in animation. For example, you can use this tool to attach a saddle to a
running horse by creating the rivet on the horse's back and parenting it to the saddle.

When calculating the transform, points defined in the Point Group
parameter are obtained from the Rivet Geometry.

The centroid of these points is designated as the origin of the rivet
coordinate frame. The x-axis of that frame is defined by the first two
points and the xy-plane of the frame is defined by the first three
points.

Alternatively, the rivet can build its coordinate frame based on point
attributes of the base surface.

@parameters

== Rivet ==

    Rivet Geometry:
        The SOP to attach the geometry to.
    Point Group:
        The point group (or point numbers) based on which the local
        surface frame is built. Group centroid is set as the frame
        origin. The x-axis of the frame is defined by first two points.

        The z-axis is perpendicular to the plane defined by first three
        points. If the point group contains only one or two points, the
        frame axes are world aligned.

    Point Weights:
        The weights assigned to the first three points in the group.
        This parameter allows to fine tune the exact position of the
        rivet origin on the plane constructed from the first three
        points. For example, the weights (0.5, 0.5, 0) will place the
        origin half way between the first and the second point. Note
        that the weights should not sum up to 0. The points beyond the
        third one, if any, are assigned the weight values of 1.
    Use Point Vector Attributes For Rivet Frame:
        With this option turned on, the rivet coordinate frame is
        calculated based on the point attributes specified in the
        parameters __X-Axis Attribute__ and __Z-Axis Attribute__. For
        all points determined by the __Point Group__ parameter, the
        attributes are evaluated for the base geometry and averaged out
        to yield two vectors X and Z that will determine the final
        x-axis and z-axis of the rivet coordinate frame. If the two
        average vectors X and Z are not orthogonal, before calculating
        the x-axis, the X vector is replaced with a vector that lies in
        the X-Z plane and that is perpendicular to the Z vector.

        If this option is turned off then the rivet uses the method for
        frame calculation described in __Point Group__ parameter help
        above.

    X-Axis Attribute:
        The name of an attribute used for the calculation of the x-axis
        in the rivet coordinate frame. This has to be a point attribute
        of a vector type.
    Z-Axis Attribute:
        The name of an attribute used for the calculation of the z-axis
        in the rivet coordinate frame. This has to be a point attribute
        of a vector type.
