"""Light Objects cast light on other objects in a scene."""

Light Objects are those objects which cast light onto other objects in a
scene. With the light parameters you can control the color, shadows,
atmosphere and render quality of objects lit by the light. Lights can
also be viewed through and used as cameras (Viewport > Camera menu).

== Light ==

Enable:
    Turning this toggle off is equivalent to setting the light intensity to 0.

Enable In Viewport:
    Turning this off removes the light from consideration in the
    viewport.  This is useful for lights which only make sense at
    render time.

Type:
    The type of light. See the [description of light types|/render/lights].

    Point:
        A light that emits light from a specific point in space defined by the transform for the light.

    Line:
        A line light which is from (-0.5, 0, 0) to (0.5, 0, 0) in the space of the light.

    Grid:
        A rectangular grid from (-0.5, -0.5, 0) to (0.5, 0.5, 0) in the space of the light.

    Disk:
        A disk shaped light. The disk is a unit circle in the XY plane in the space of the light.

    Sphere:
        A sphere shaped light. The sphere is a unit sphere in the space of the light.

    Tube:
        A tube shaped light. The first parameter of __Area Size__ controls the height of the tube and the second controls the radius.

    Geometry:
        Use the object specified by the __Geometry Object__ parameter to define the shape of the area light.

    Distant:
        A directional light source infinitely far from the scene.  Distant light sources cast sharp shadows, and so are candidates for the use of depth map shadows.

    Sun:
        A finite sized (non-point) directional light source infinitely far from the scene.  Sun lights are similar to distant lights with the exception that they produce a penumbra - similar to the actual sun.

Color:
    The color of the light source.

Intensity:
    The linear intensity of the light source. If the intensity is 0, the light is disabled. In this case, the light will only be sent to the renderer if the object is included in the __Force Lights__ parameter of the output driver.

Exposure:
    Light intensity as a power of 2. Increasing the value by 1 will double the energy emitted by the light source. A value of 0 produces an intensity of 1 at the source, -1 produces 0.5. The result of this is multiplied with the __Intensity__ parameter.
    
    NOTE:
        This value will be automatically set based on what is visible when the light is first placed in the scene.

Contributions:
    Provides detailed control over which shading components the light affects. To disable contribution to a named component, add an entry to the contribution list, specify the component name, and disable the toggle.  Light contributions can also be used to control whether the light contributes to direct or indirect lighting.  To disable contributions to direct lighting, use the "direct" component label and to disable indirect lighting, use the "indirect" component label.

[IncludeProp:categories]

Sampling Quality:
    The sampling quality for area light sources and sun lights. Depending on the area of the light source, more samples might be needed to provide smoother illumination.  Sampling quality is specified relative to the ray sampling parameters on the mantra ROP - so if the ray samples on the ROP are set to 4 and the sampling quality is set to 4, 16 samples will be used for the light source.

Render Light Geometry:
    Causes the light source geometry to appear as an object or background in the render, as if an extra geometry object were created with the same geometry as the light source.  Render light geometry can be used to identify the actual brightness of area light sources when debugging the intensity of specular highlights, and to aid in the placement of light sources in IPR renders.

=== Spot Light Options ===

[Image:/nodes/images/cone_angle.png]

Spot lights change the illumination of a light source based on the angle with the light source viewing direction.  In the diagram above, the area within the center ring receives full illumination. The light falls off between the inner ring (defined by the __Cone angle__) and the outer ring (defined by the __Cone delta__).  The dashed line represents where illumination is half as bright as within the cone angle.  The __Cone rolloff__ parameter moves this line between the center and outer rings.

Enable Spot Light:
    Enables spot or cone light falloff.  Spot light can be applied to any light type including area lights.

Use cone angle for field of view:
    When rendering shadow maps or using a projection map with a spot light, the __Cone Angle__ will be used to define the field of view. However, to be able to get better shadows on a certain section of geometry, it is useful to be able to de-couple the field of view control. Toggling this parameter off will enable the __Projection Angle__ or __Orthographic Width__ parameters.

Projection Angle:
    The viewing angle used for depth map generation when perspective view is used.

Cone Angle:
    The size of the spotlight's beam. Enter the number of
    degrees wide the spotlight's cone should be. You can only
    change this parameter if you are using a cone light.
            
Cone Delta:
    Number of degrees of penumbra for spotlights.

Cone Rolloff:
    Shape exponent of penumbra (larger = sharper).

Projection Map:
    Specifies the image that gets projected. The viewing angle of the light will determine the area of projection.

Near Clipping:
    Distance to the near clipping plane.

Far Clipping:
    Distance to the far clipping plane.

Environment/IES Map:
    This parameter sets an environment map or IES file to be used
    to tint illumination based on the direction in which the light
    is cast.  Environment maps can be used with all light types
    including point lights.

Environment Space:
    The space to use for environment map lookups.  By default, the
    light's space will be used so that transforming the light
    source will also transform the environment map.

Environment Null:
    When __Environment Space__ is set to __Use Environment Null__,
    this parameter can be used to configure the transform object to
    use for orienting the environment map.

Map Blur Angle:
    Specifies the angle over which the environment map should be
    blurred.

Map Angle Scale:
    Scales the environment map angle, relative to the light axis.
    Values larger than 1 will expand the map while values less than
    1 will compress the map into a smaller angle.  This value is
    especially useful with IES maps, in which case it can be used
    to increase or decrease the built-in cone angle without
    changing the map file.
    
    
=== Area Light Options ===

Area Size:
    The size of the area light source.  It is possible to define a different light scale in the x and y directions - for example, to produce a rectangular light.
    
    NOTE:
        When using the Tube Light, the first parameter controls the height of the tube and the second controls the radius.

Normalize Light Intensity to Area:
    Scales the light source intensity to take into account the visible area of the light.  When enabled, increasing the size of an area light will not have any effect on the total amount of illumination produced by the light source, so that the size of the light can be adjusted only to change the softness of shadows.  When disabled, increasing the size of an area light will cause the total amount of illumination produced by the light to increase proportionally with area.  When rendering physically correct scenes, it is often useful to disable this option and use __Physically Correct__ attenuation since this can produce more predictable physically accurate lighting results.

Single Sided:
    Causes the light source to emit light only in the direction of
    the surface normal.

Reverse Emission Direction:
    When rendering a single sided light, reverses the direction of
    emission so that it is in the reverse normal direction.

Self Shadow:
    Controls whether the area light source casts shadows on itself.  If the
    light geometry exists elsewhere in the scene, you can disable this
    toggle to avoid computing the shadows twice.

Texture Map:
    Specifies a texture map to be used to tint illumination based
    on the uv coordinate on the geometry.

Sharp Spot Light:
    If this area light is a spot light or uses an environment/IES image to
    define the spot appearance, enabling this parameter will cause the spot
    light cone to render sharply even though shadows remain soft.

Enable Edge Falloff:
    Enables a simple edge falloff calculation to soften the edges
    of primitive area light types.

Edge Width:
    The percentage of the light size that should be treated as the
    edge of the light source for falloff calculation.

Edge Rolloff:
    Shape exponent for edge rolloff (larger = sharper).

Geometry Object:
    Reference to a geometry object to be used for Geometry area
    light types.  The light source will take on the appearance of
    the referenced geometry.  Normally you should turn off the
    display of the originating geometry object to avoid
    self-shadowing artifacts.

    TIP:
        For the best performance and quality when rendering
        geometry area lights, evaluate your geometry against the
        following checklist.
        * Use the lowest resolution geometry that is a good approximation for the shape of the desired illuminating surface.  Higher resolution geometry or subdivision surfaces will take longer to render and may introduce additional sampling noise.
        * Use open surfaces rather than closed meshes, and delete primitives that are known to contribute no illumination to the scene.  Mantra may perform lighting computations for hidden faces - so if you can manually remove these primitives rendering performance will improve.

Transform Into This Object:
    Enabling this parameter causes the transform on this light
    object to be ignored, which will cause the geometry to be
    placed in the same location in space as the original object.
    
==== Point Cloud Options ====

The point cloud options on the geometry light can be used to accelerate
rendering of complex geometry light shapes including emissive volumes.  It
works by first generating a point cloud using mantra's micropolygon
renderer, and then samples this point cloud during the render to find the
most important nearby points that illuminate a shading point.  Illumination
is computed from the Ce (Emission) export from standard surface shaders -
so the point cloud light is an alternative to using extra diffuse or
reflection bounces to capture this lighting.

TIP:
    For simple geometry lights or basic area lights, using a point cloud
    can actually slow down the render or produce noisier results.  Point
    clouds are best suited for complex geometry or volumes where
    emission varies widely across the model.

Enable Point Cloud:
    Enables the point cloud sampler.

Point Samples:
    The number of aggregate points to search for during shading.  Points
    are queried using the pcopenlod() interface in VEX, which clusters
    points together based on their effect on the current shading position.
    Using a larger point count will cause mantra to use more detail from
    the point cloud, while smaller sample counts will tend to use averaged
    results.  Using a point count of 1 will approximate the entire
    point cloud with a single point.

    Even with a low `Point Samples`, you will still see soft shadows in the
    render - since mantra uses sampling to choose a concrete sub-point for
    each aggregate point sample.

    To set the point samples for optimal performance, gradually
    decrease the number of samples until there is a noticeable degredation
    in the rendered result.

Point Cloud File:
    The file to store the points.  This should be a .pc file.  The default
    value of "temp:$OS.pc" stores the file in temporary memory that is
    discarded when mantra exits, so if you wish to reuse a point cloud
    between renders it is necessary to explicitly specify a file path in
    this parameter.

    TIP:
	Point clouds can be inspected using the gplay utility or by loading
	them directly into houdini using the file SOP.  Both these
	approaches will automatically convert the point cloud to a geometry
	file.

Auto-generate Point Cloud:
    Enables automatic generation of a point cloud using the micropolygon
    PBR rendering engine.  Point cloud generation executes the micropolygon
    renderer without generating an image, and will gradually build up a
    point cloud using a shader that writes points directly to the file.
    The data stored in the point cloud includes the emission (Ce) as well
    as point area/volume information and position (P).  Point cloud
    generation will proceed before the main render begins.

    TIP:
	Use the IPR Viewer pane to see a progress bar for point cloud
	generation.  When using IPR with point clouds, be sure to press the
	__Render__ button if you need to regenerate point clouds - point
	clouds are treated the same way as depth maps in IPR, and so must
	be manually regenerated when they are out of date.

Shading Quality:
    Controls the density of points stored in the point cloud.  This
    overrides the _Shading Quality Multiplier_ parameter on the ROP for
    point cloud generation.

Override Dicing Camera:
    When enabled, the _Dicing Camera_ parameter specifies the viewing
    camera to use for point cloud generation.  If some of the illuminating
    geometry is outside the viewing region for the rendering camera, it is
    desirable to use a separate camera for point cloud generation so that
    all illumination is accounted for.

Dicing Camera:
    The camera object to use for point cloud generation.  A different
    resolution and view can be configured on this camera to optimize point
    cloud generation.

=== Distant Light Options ===

Orthographic Width:
    Controls the field of view for depth map generation from distant light sources.

Sun Angle:
    The angle for the __Sun__ light type.  Larger angles will produce blurrier shadows.

=== Attenuation Options ===

Attenuation:
    Controls how light decreases in intensity the farther you get from the light source.

    NOTE:
        When using area light sources, it is often useful to set the attenuation type to __Physically Correct__ as opposed to __Half Distance Attenuation__ or __No Attenuation__.  Area lights are often placed close to the scene, so using non-physical attenuation can produce unrealistic results.
    
    No Attenuation:
        The light is the same intensity, regardless of how far away a surface is from the light.
    
    Half Distance Attenuation:
        You specify a distance at which the light attains half the intensity that it is at the origin of the light. This is modeled mathematically as

        {{{
        Cl = H / ( H + D )
        }}}

        where H is the half distance and D is the distance from the light source. When D is 0, we end up with H/H which is 1. When D is equal to H (the half-distance) the intensity is H/(H+H), which is half the intensity.

        The light is never fully extinguished no matter the distance from the source.
        
    Physically Correct Attenuation:
        In reality, light falls off based on the the inverse square law. This attenuation mode implements this type of fall off. Mathematically, the intensity is modeled by

        {{{
        Cl = 1 / (D * D)
        }}}

Half Distance:
    The distance from the light at which __Half Distance Attenuation__ produces half the light intensity.  
    
Attenuation Start:
    Minimum light distance to be used for attenuation of point lights and line area lights.  Point light illumination on diffuse surfaces will be constant within this radius.

Active Radius:
    The radius of effect for the light source.  When rendering with many light sources, reducing the active radius can speed up renders by avoiding lighting and shadowing calculations for light sources that are outside this radius.

Use Attenuation Ramp Multiplier:
    Enables a ramp control to directly adjust the attenuation at different distances.  The ramp will be multiplied by the existing light intensity without the ramp to produce the final light intensity at a given distance.

Ramp Start Distance:
    The distance that corresponds to the first entry in the attenuation ramp.  Distances smaller than the ramp start distance will be clamped - that is they will share the initial value in the ramp.

Ramp End Distance:
    The distance that corresponds to the last entry in the attenuation ramp.  Distances larger than the ramp end distance will be clamped - that is they will share the final value in the ramp.  You can set the final entry in the attenuation ramp to black to ensure that the light fades out past this distance.

Attenuation Ramp Multiplier:
    Linear ramp of colors to be multiplied by the light intensity at given distances.
                
== Shadow ==

Shadow Type:
    None:
        No shadows will be cast by this light.
    
    Ray-Traced Shadows:
        Ray-tracing will be used to compute shadows from this light source.

    Depth Map Shadows:
        Shadows will be computed using a depth map. When transparent shadows are turned on, deep shadow maps will be used. Otherwise, simple z-depth shadow maps will be used.
   
Shadow Mask:
        A mask of objects which will be considered occluders for the light source. When ray-traced shadows are used, only these objects will be intersected by shadow rays. When depth map shadows are used, only these objects will appear in the depth map.

        NOTE:
            It is possible to use categories by adding the `shadowcategories` rendering parameter.


Shadow Intensity:
    A scale on how much light is blocked by occluders. By decreasing the shadow intensity, the occluders will not block all the light, allowing some illumination through.

Shadow Color:
    Specifies a color that should be used in place of black for fully opaque  shadows.  This value is combined with the Shadow Intensity to produce the final shadow value.

Transparent Shadows:
    When this option is turned on, the surface shader of occluders will be evaluated to determine the opacity. Turning this option on will cause deep shadow maps to be used when shadowing using Depth Map Shadows.

=== Depth Map Options ===

These options only apply to depth map shadows.

Deep shadows are produced by default when rendering Depth Map Shadows with __Transparent Shadows__ enabled. Their advantage include:

* Shadows of transparent objects, including volumetric objects.
* Motion-blurred shadows.
* Better shadow anti-aliasing.

Deep shadow maps store the opacity of any translucent objects the
light ray passes through as well as the depth of the final opaque
surface.

See the discussion for the __Shadow Type__ parameter on the
__Shadow__ tab for additional information on deep shadows.

NOTE:
    Deep shadows use significantly more disk space than plain depth
    maps.

Shadow Bias:
    The bias when computing shadows from this light source. This is a small distance. If occluders are within this distance, they will not be considered shadowers. This is to prevent self-shadowing artifacts due to the limited resolution of depth map shadows.
    
    Increase the bias value to obtain a nice shadow when working with a large scene. Try a shadow bias 5-10% of the scene scale to start.
    
Shadow Quality:
    Adjust the quality of lookups when evaluating standard shadow maps or blurred shadows.

Shadow Softness:
    A blur on the shadow map when using depth mapped shadows, specified
    relative to the size of a micropolygon when rendering with
    Micropolygon Rendering.
        
Shadow Blur:
    Controls the fraction of the shadow map image to blur when rendering. 
    
    This parameter can be used to blur the map disregarding the surface derivatives, which are taken into account but the __Shadow Softness__ parameter.

Auto-generate Shadow Map:
    Generate a shadow map from this light source during the next render.

Shadow Map:
    The path to the shadow map.

Resolution:
    The resolution of the shadow map. It is a good idea to keep the resolution the same in X and Y.

Pixel Samples:
    The number of pixel samples to be used when rendering shadow maps. This is more important when deep shadow maps (transparent shadows) are being used.

Depth Map Motion Blur:
    When rendering deep shadow maps, it is possible to capture motion blur in the shadow map. If motion blurred shadows are desired, it's important to turn on Transparent Shadows.

== Material ==

Material:
    Allows a specific shader to override the automatically generated shader for area light rendering.  If you use a surface shader to shade a light source, you should verify that the shader does not compute illumination itself.  Materials assigned to light sources should only emit light - not absorb light themselves.

    For example, the __VEX Area Light__ shader can be used.  This is also the shader that is used by default when rendering a light without a material assigned.
