= Animation Rig Quadruped IK Spine =

"""Provides parameters to animate the IK spine for a quadruped character."""

@parameters

Display Bodypart:
     Toggles the display of proxy geometry for the spine.
    
== Animation ==

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for the spine controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets the animation parameter values to their default values.
    
Hip-Chest Lead:
    Blends the effect of the hips being lead by the chest. A value of 1 will move the back hip portion of the spine when you move the neck control. A value of 0 will not move the hips.

Stretch Ratio:
    Controls the stretch ratio for IK body parts.  A value of 0 is no stretch, and a value of 1 is full stretch.  Stretch is a percentage of the distance between the end of the bone and IK control.

The rest of the controls on this tab are for translating and rotating different parts of the spine.
   
== Rigging ==

Hook Object:
    The path of the hook object.
    
    NOTE:
        The hook object provides parent transforms to the body part. 

=== Pretransforms ===

Provides controls to change the pretransform positions of the parts of the spine.

=== Bone Lengths ===

Provides controls to change the lengths of the chest, spine, and sacrum bones.

=== Kinematic Solvers ===

Points to the kinematic solvers for the chest lead bone and spine.

=== Hook Out Rotations ===

Provides controls to set the hook out rotations for the sacrum, bones, and spine end.

== Preferences ==

Display Bones:
    Toggles the display of bones on the rig.

Display Animation Controls:
    Toggles the display of animation controls on the rig.

Display Proxy Geometry:
    Toggles the display of the proxy geometry for the body part.

Control Scale:
    Modify the per-part control scale.

Control Color:
    Modify the per-part control color.

=== Control Level of Detail ===

These parameters allow you to modify the display of the COG, COG pivot/gimbal, neck, neck gimbal, hip, hip gimbal, spine neck, spine hip, ribcage, ribcage gimbal, and spine ribcage.
