"""The Path object creates an oriented curve (path)"""

The Path object is a regular Geometry object with default geometry operators
that define an oriented curve (path). This object should be created using
the viewer Path tool. If it is created in Network View, then one needs to
manually setup the paths inside this object's points_merge geometry node.

The orientation is defined by the normals of the control vertices. The control
vertices (PathCV objects) can be rotated by an arbitrary angle (even more than
360) and the orientation on the curve between the control vertices will
be interpolated using a flexible rope metaphor.

The geometry created has normal and twist attributes.  The normal specifies the
orientation, while the twist attributes are used to determine the correct
direction of the normal. The initial twist defines the path twist distribution
at the path creation time. The twist defines the curve twist induced by the
rotation of the handles after the path was created.

An oriented path created by the Path tool can be used, for example, in the
Bones From Curve tool. The bones created from a path will flow naturally
following the path orientation.
