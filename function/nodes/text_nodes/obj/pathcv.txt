"""The PathCV object creates control vertices used by the Path object."""

The PathCV object is a regular Geometry object with default geometry operators
that define a control vertex used by the Path object. This object is created
when using the viewer Path tool. 

The geometry created has normal and twist attributes.  The normal specifies the
orientation, while the twist attributes are used to determine the correct
direction of the normal. The initial twist defines the path twist distribution
at the path creation time. The twist defines the curve twist induced by the
rotation of the handles after the path was created.
