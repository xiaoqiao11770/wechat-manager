"""The Python Script object is a container for the geometry operators
(SOPs) that define a modeled object."""

The Python Script object allows contained 
geometries to be altered via python script.

@parameters

== Transform ==

    Translate:
        To translate 1, 2, and 3 in the x, y, and z directions respectively:
        
        n = hou.pwd()
        
        t = hou.hmath.buildTranslate((1, 2, 3))
        
        n.setCookTransform(t)

    Rotate:
        To rotate 30, 60, and 90 degrees about the x, y, and z axes respectively:
        
        n = hou.pwd()
        
        r = hou.hmath.buildTranslate((30, 60, 90))
        
        n.setCookTransform(r)

    Scale:
        To scale 2, 3, and 4 along the x, y, and z axes respectively:

        n = hou.pwd()

        s = hou.hmath.buildScale(2, 3, 4)

        n.setCookTransform(s)

    Transform:
        To apply scaling, rotation, and translation in that order:

        n.setCookTransform(s*r*t)

        Note: n, t, r, s defined as above.

    Examples:
