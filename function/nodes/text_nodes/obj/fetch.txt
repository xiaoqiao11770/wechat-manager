"""The Fetch Object gets its transform by copying the transform of
another object."""

The Fetch Object gets its transform by copying the transform of another
object. This makes it easy to get the transform of an object contained
in a subnet, and use it as the parent of an object at another level in
the object hierarchy.


@parameters
    Fetch Object:
        Name of the object to use as the source for this object's
        transform.
    Use Parent Transform of This Object:
        If this option is set, then in the calculations of its world
        transform the Fetch object will include its input transform.
        Usually, the input transform also contains the parent subnet's
        transform, if the Fetch object is contained in a subnet. If this
        option is not set, then the world transform will not include the
        parent transform.
    Use Parent Transform of Fetched Object:
        If this option is set, then in the calculations of its world
        transform the Fetch object will include the input transform of
        the fetched object (along with the parent subnet's transform of
        the fetched object, if the fetched object is contained within a
        subnet). If this option is not set, then the world transform
        will not include the parent transform of the fetched object.
    Fetch Subnet Transform:
        This option is only available if the object being fetched is an
        object subnet and the parent transform of the fetched object is
        used. If this parameter is set, then it will fetch the subnet's
        real world transform (computed using the subnet's translate,
        rotate and scale parameters) instead of the transform defined by
        subnet's output.
    Invert Fetched Transform:
        This parameter inverts the fetched transform before using it in
        the Fetch object. If the Fetch object uses also the parent
        transform of the fetched object, then both the local transform
        of the fetched object and the parent transform of the fetched
        object are inverted in such a way, that, in its calculations,
        the Fetch object effectively uses an inverted world transform of
        the fetched object.
