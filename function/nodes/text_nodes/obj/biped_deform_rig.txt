= Biped Deform Rig =

"""Provides parameters to control the display of the biped autorig."""

NOTE:
    After you generate the Animation and Deform rigs, you have to __Refresh Imports__ from the gear menu in the Parameters tab of the [Operator Type Properties|/ref/windows/optype] of the two assets, since the parameter dialogs are relatively empty. The dialogs are build using the new Import Blocks, so you have to tell the assets to refresh and populate the import folders, and currently HOM can't do that but will be able to in the future so the assets will be able to be put down locked and ready to go.
