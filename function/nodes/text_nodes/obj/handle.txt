"""The Handle Object is an IK tool for manipulating bones."""

The Handle Object is an IK tool designed for manipulating bones that conform
to multiple end affectors. In contrast with regular IK which only has 1 end
affector (or goal object), this method allows for several end affectors per
bone. Furthermore, the bones need not be a chain. Any setup, including
branches, are handled.

One typical example is the use of motion capture data. In higher-end
systems, you typically have a cloud of marker positions and a skeleton
to be driven by it.

This Handle Object works in tandem with the Handle CHOP (see for
example). The following setup is commonly used: Given a hierarchy of
bones, attach one or more Handle objects to specific locations on each
bone object (as children). Assign each handle a target in space to follow.
Create a Handle CHOP which collects this information and calculates the
rotation channels for the bones. Export these values back to the bones.


@parameters

    == Handle ==

        Handle Target:
            The end affector object.

        Translate:
            A translational offset from the origin of the parent.

        Weight:
            Used to weigh multiple affectors attached to each bone.

        Falloff:
            Describes how much a handle will affect bones higher in its
            chain.

        Twist Only:
            This option specifies that the handle object only affect the
            twist rotation of its parent bone, not all three rotations.

        Rotation Limits X/Y/Z:
            This specifies the min/max rotation angles of the bone with respect
            to its parent.
