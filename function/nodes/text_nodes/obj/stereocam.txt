= Stereo Camera Template =

"""Serves as a basis for constructing a more functional stereo camera rig as a digital asset."""

The Stereo Camera Template (stereocam) is a native operator type in Houdini. Houdini viewport recognizes the stereocam type and uses the anaglyph composition mode for displaying the scene.

== Stereo ==

Left/Right Camera:
    Specify the left and right view points.

Render Cameras:
    Instructs the Mantra render node to use the left and right cameras for rendering. 
    
    By default the __Left Camera__ and __Right Camera__ refer to the Stereo Camera Template node itself, thus producing identical images for the left and right channels.

Projection:
    Type of camera projection used for rendering.

    Perspective:
        This simulates the classic pinhole camera where camera rays emanate
        from a common camera origin through a flat camera plane.

    Orthographic:
        This uses parallel camera rays that are orthogonal to the (flat)
        camera plane. The width of the view volume is determined by the
        Ortho Width parameter below.

    Polar (panoramic):
        This projection uses a spherical camera plane for rendering.

    Cylindrical (panoramic):
        This projection uses a cylindrical camera plane for rendering.
        
    NOTE:
        Selecting __Polar__ or __Cylindrical__ will automatically switch the __Rendering Engine__ (on the output driver) to __Ray Tracing__, as it is impossible to render a polar or cylindrical projection with micropolygon rendering.

Focal Length:
    Camera focal length (zoom).

Focal Units:
    The units used for the focal length.

Aperture:
    Width of the visible field.
    
    [Image:../images/fov.png]
    
Ortho Width:
    Width of orthographic view volume when using Projection is set to
    Orthographic.
    
Near Clipping:
    Position of near clipping plane.
    
Far Clipping:
    Position of far clipping plane.
    
Screen Window X/Y:
    Define the center of the window during the rendering process.
    
Screen Window Size:
    Scale for expanding the cropped area specified by the Crop parameters.
    
Left/Right/Bottom/Top Crop:
    Defines the cropping area in terms of the camera's viewing area margins.
        
== Sampling ==

Shutter Time:
    The portion of the frame interval that the camera shutter is
    open. Used to determine motion blur. `[0,1]`
    
Focus Distance:
    The lens focal distance and distance from the camera at
    which objects will be in focus. This is only used when rendering using
    depth of field. Objects outside this distance will be blurred.
    
F-Stop:
    Lens fstop. This is only used when rendering using depth of field.
    Determines blurriness of depth of field effects.
    
Bokeh:
    Filter kernel used in depth of field rendering.

    radial:
        Use a gaussian filter kernel (highest quality)

    box:
        Use a box filter kernal

    null:
        Do not filter
