= Extract Transform =

"""The Extract Transform Object gets its transform by comparing the points of two pieces of geometry."""

The Extract Transform Object gets its transform by looking at the points of two SOP geometries.  The difference of these point clouds is projected into a rigid transform consisting of a rotation and translation, and this then becomes the transform of this object.

This extraction is very useful when you have baked geometry files which represent rigid motion and want to recover that rigid motion at object level.

The resulting transform may contain reflections that will invert normals if the object is close to planar.  To resolve this, you can add extra marker points to the two objects, such as an Attribute Wrangle set to `addpoint(geoself(), @P + 0.1*@N)`; to prevent extraction of an inverted transform.

@parameters
Source Path:
	Path to the SOP geometry to use as the rest reference geometry.

Destination Path:
	Path to the SOP geometry to use as the goal geometry.  The transform will transform the source geometry
	into the destination geometry.
	
Extract Translate:
	Whether to use the motion of the point cloud.

Extract Rotate:
	Whether to use the rotation of the point cloud.  This is always measured about the average of the points in the point cloud.
