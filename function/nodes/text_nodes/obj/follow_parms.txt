Path Object:
    A reference to the curve node or object you want this object to follow.

Roll:
    The orientation of the object around the path.

Position:
    The position of the object along the path. `0.0` means at the beginning of the path, and `1.0` means the end. The integer portion of the position is used as the primitive number inside the geometry while the fractional part indicates the u value on the primitive.
    
    If the primitive number does not exist, then it is wrapped back to the beginning. So for numbers greater than `1.0` in a path object that only have a single primitive, it wraps around to the beginning again. You can easily animate something moving around a circular track simply by continuously increasing the position value.
    
    Keyframe this value to animate the object moving along the path. 
    
    NOTE:
        The [Follow Path|/shelf/followpath] tool on the shelf automatically sets keyframes on this parameter that you may want to edit or replace.
    
    The __Parameterization__ option controls how position values between 0 and 1 correspond to knots on the path curve.

Parameterization:
    Controls how the Position parameter is translated into a point on the path curve. Use __Arc-length__ (the default) to interpolate the position values evenly along the physical length of the curve.
    
    Use __Uniform__ to distribute the position values between the knots of the curve. This lets you slow down the object at certain points by bunching up knots in the path curve. However, it is much more convenient to simply edit the animation curve to control the speed of the object along the path.

Orient Along Path:
    Orient the object according to the path's curvature.

Orient Up Vector:
    The direction vector of the object's Y axis to orient with.

Auto-Bank factor:
    Controls automatic banking of the object as it turns corners. Set this to `0` to turn automatic banking off.
