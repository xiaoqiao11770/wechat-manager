= Ragdoll Run Example =

"""Crowd example showing a simple ragdoll setup."""

The setup creates a number of running agents. At a random time, agents are switched into a ragdoll state where they are solved as active objects by the Bullet solver.

NOTE:
        The animation clips need to be baked out before playing the scene. This should happen automatically if example is created from Crowds shelf. Otherwise save scene file to a location of your choice and click Render on '/obj/bake_cycles' ropnet to write out the files. The default path for the files is ${HIP}/agents.
