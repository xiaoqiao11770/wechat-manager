= Animation Rig Quadruped Front Leg =

"""Provides parameters to animate the front leg for a quadruped character."""

@parameters

Display Bodypart:
     Toggles the display of proxy geometry for the front leg.
    
== Animation ==

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for the leg controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets the animation parameter values to their default values.
    
Custom Control Space:
    Provides a custom control space to IK solutions.  This allows you to lock the controls to an object in world space, independent of the rig space.

Custom Space Blend:
    Blend between the standard and any custom IK space.
    
The rest of these parameters provide controls to translate and rotate the parts of the front leg.

== Rigging ==

=== Hooks ===

Hook Object:
    The path of the hook object.
    
    NOTE:
        The hook object provides parent transforms to the body part. 

Hook Controls:  
    References to global character placer so the arm moves relative to it.

Side:
    Determines if the leg is the left or right leg of the character.  
    
=== Pretransforms ===

Provides controls to change the pretransform positions of the parts of the leg.

=== Bone Rotations ===

Provides controls to rotate the shoulder, shoulderblade, upperarmm, and forearm.

=== Bone Rest Angles ===

Provides controls to set the bone rest angles for the shoulder, shoulderblade, upperarmm, and forearm.

=== Bone Lengths ===

Provides controls to set the bone lengths for the shoulder, shoulderblade, upperarmm, and forearm.

=== Kinematic Solvers ===

Points to the kinematic solvers for the shoulder bone, shoulderblade bone, and arm.

=== Hook Out Rotations ===

Provides controls to set the hook out rotations for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, palm, finger, and shoulderblade.

== Preferences ==

Display Bones:
    Toggles the display of bones on the rig.

Display Animation Controls:
    Toggles the display of animation controls on the rig.

Display Proxy Geometry:
    Toggles the display of the proxy geometry for the body part.

Control Scale:
    Modify the per-part control scale.

Control Color:
    Modify the per-part control color.

=== Control Level of Detail ===

These parameters allow you to modify the display of the shoulder, shoulderblade, arm twist, hand, finger tip, palm, and finger.
