TIP:
    Select a node and press ((1)) to set its _display_ flag.

Display flag:
    Use this to make entire objects visible or invisible.
    
Selectable flag:
    Use this to make certain objects unselectable. This lets you
    concentrate on other objects, and prevents you from accidentally
    selecting objects you don't want to touch.
