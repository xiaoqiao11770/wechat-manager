"""Creates a sticky object based on the UV's of a surface, usually for parenting."""

This tool creates an object which takes its transform from the world-space position of a UV point on a polygonal surface. You can then parent another object to the Sticky object to make the object follow the surface.

This is similar to the [Icon:OBJ/rivet] [Rivet|rivet] tool; however, this tool is more precise since you can attach the sticky anywhere on the surface and you can [animate|/anim] the position as well as the object. For example, you could animate a monkey riding on an elephant's back while sliding across the surface trying to balance.

The Sticky Object gets its transform from the surface of a polygonal
mesh. The mesh must also have texture coordinates that are used to
determine the parameterization of the polygons.

Sticky Objects may be parented to other sticky objects. In this case
they will parent their 2d UV transformation (both the UV offset and the
rotation). If one parents sticky objects, the Fetch World Transform
should be turned on.

The __Sticky Geometry__ path determines the object to stick to. To stick objects to sticky geometry, you must parent the geometry you want stuck to the Sticky node.

For example to stick a sphere to a grid, make sure the grid has uv texture attributes, create a Sticky Object, set the __Sticky Geometry__ to the grid, and parent the sphere to the Sticky Object.

@parameters

== Sticky ==

    Sticky Geometry:
        The SOP to stick the geometry to.
    Attribute:
        The attribute name of the texture to use for the polygonal
        parameterization.
    UV:
        The UV coordinates to evaluate the mesh at.
    Rotation:
        The angle to rotate the local coordinate frame about the surface
        normal. It will only take effect when Orient to Surface is on.
        However, any other sticky objects parented to this one will
        inherit this rotation.
    Orient To Surface:
        Whether the local orientation of the point should be used. The
        surface normal is used as the Z axis and the texture's U axis is
        used as the Y axis.
    Fetch World Transform:
        If this is set, the transform of the Sticky Geometry will be
        used. If not set, the parent transform of this node will be
        used.
    Wrap in U/V:
        When not set, u and v values outside the range will be ignored.
        When it is set, they will be wrapped until they lie within the
        range.
    U/V Range:
        This is the range of texture space to work within. Geometry
        whose texture coordinates lie outside this range will be
        ignored.
    Assume UV Coordinates Unchanging:
        The sticky object builds a cache of the target surface's
        texture coordinates. When this is set, the cache is kept even if
        the target's geometry changes.
    Clear UV Caches:
        The Sticky Object is conservative about rebuilding the UV
        information. This will force it to update the UV texture
        lookups.
