    Keep Position When Parenting:
        When the object is re-parented, maintain its current world
        position by changing the object's transform parameters.

    Child Compensation:
        When the object is being transformed, maintain the current world transforms
        of its children by changing their transform parameters.

    Pre-transform menu:
        This menu contains options for manipulating the
        [pre-transform|/basics/objects#pretransform]  values.

    Transform Order:
        The left menu chooses the order in which transforms are applied
        (for example, scale, then rotate, then move. This can change the
        position and orientation of the object, in the same way that
        going a block and turning east takes you to a different place
        than turning east and then going a block.

        The right menu chooses the order in which to rotate around the
        X, Y, and Z axes. Certain orders can make character joint
        transforms easier to use, depending on the character.

    Translate/Rotation/Scale:
        See  [transforming objects|/basics/objects] .

    Pivot:
        See  [setting the pivot point|/basics/objects] .

    Uniform Scale:
        This slider changes the size of an object uniformly along all
        three axes.

    Look At:
        Constrains an object so it always points at another object's
        _origin_ (see  [pivot point vs.
        origin|/basics/objects#pivot] ). This is useful if, for
        example, you want a camera to follow another object.

    Look At Up Vector:
        When specifying a "look at", it is possible to specify an up
        vector for the look at. Without using an up vector, it is
        possible to get poor animation when the look at object passes
        through the Y axis of the target object.

        Don't Use Up Vector:
            Use this option if the look at object does not pass through
            the Y axis of the target object.
        Use Up Vector:
            This precisely defines the rotates on the object doing the
            looking. The up vector specified should not be parallel to
            the look at direction. See Orient Up Vector below.
        Use Quaternions:
            Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D
            rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of
            moving from one point to another on a sphere.
    Path Object:
        Names the object that functions as the path you want this object
        to move along. For example, you can name an object that provides
        a spline path for the camera to follow.

        Having an object follow an animation path is simple. However,
        when using a NURBS curve as your path, you might notice that the
        object speeds up and slows down unexpectedly as it travels along
        the path. This is usually because the CVs are spaced unevenly.
        In such a case, use the Resample SOP to redistribute the CVs so
        that they are evenly spaced along the curve. A caution however -
        using a Resample sop can be slow if you have an animating path
        curve.

        An alternative method is to append a Basis sop to the path curve
        and change it to a Uniform Curve. This way, your object will
        move uniformly down the curve, and there is no need for the
        Resample sop and the unnecessary points it generates.

    Roll:
        Using the angle control or the editing filed, you can specify an
        object's rotation as it animates along the path.

    Position:
        This parameter lets you specify the position of the object along
        the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from
        zero to one, where zero equals the starting point and one equals
        the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as
        high as ten for multiple "passes" along the path.

    Orient Along Path:
        If this option is selected, the object will be oriented along
        the path. The positive Z axis of the object will be pointing
        down the path.

    Orient Up Vector:
        When orienting an object, the up vector is used to determine
        where the positive Y axis points.

    Auto-Bank Factor:
        The Auto-Bank factor rolls the object based on the curvature of
        the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set
        the bank scale to 0.

    Use Display Color:
        When this parameter is enabled, and the object is being
        displayed in wireframe mode in the Viewport, the object will be
        displayed using the color specified below.

    Display color:
        Set the desired display color by specifying an RGB value here,
        or by using the HSV sliders. Clicking the ((Plus)) button
        displays a color dialog that allows you to select from a range
        of predefined colors. Click on the desired color's name, or on
        the color swatch, to select that color. The name of the selected
        color appears highlight to indicate that it is active.

    Viewport Selecting Enabled:
        Enabling this button changes the object's status to
        _selectable_, meaning that the object is capable of being
        selected for specific commands and of being singled-out as an
        editable object in the Viewport.

    Selection Script:
        Clicking the button to the right of the edit field displays an
        open file dialog that lets you search for a script to execute
        when you click on the selected object in the Viewport using the
        Select Operation.
