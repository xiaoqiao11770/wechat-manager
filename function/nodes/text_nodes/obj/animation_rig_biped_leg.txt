= Animation Rig Biped Leg =

"""Provides parameters to animate the leg for a biped character."""

@parameters

Display Bodypart:
     Toggles the display of proxy geometry for the leg.
    
== Animation ==

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for the leg controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets the animation parameter values to their default values.

FK/IK Blend:
    Blends between forward and inverse kinematic solutions.

Match FK to IK:
    Matches the FK rotations to the IK solver end positions.

Match IK to FK:
    Matches the IK solver end positions to the FK rotations.

Stretch Ratio:
    Controls the stretch ratio for IK body parts.  A value of 0 is no stretch, and a value of 1 is full stretch.  Stretch is a percentage of the distance between the end of the bone and IK control.

Custom Control Space:
    Provides a custom control space to IK solutions.  This allows you to lock the controls to an object in world space, independent of the rig space.

Custom Space Blend:
    Blend between the standard and any custom IK space.
    
The rest of these parameters provide IK and FK controls to translate and rotate the parts of the leg.
    
== Rigging ==

=== Hooks ===

Hook Object:
    The path of the hook object.
    
    NOTE:
        The hook object provides parent transforms to the body part. 

Hook Controls:  
    References to global character placer so the arm moves relative to it.

Side:
    Determines if the leg is the left or right leg of the character.

=== Pretransforms ===

Provides controls to change the pretransform positions of the parts of the leg.

=== Bone Rotations ===

Provides controls to rotate the pelvis, IK thigh, shin bone, ankle bone and toe bone.

=== Bone Rest Angles ===

Provides controls to set the bone rest angles for the pelvis, IK thigh, shin bone, ankle bone and toe bone.

=== Bone Lengths ===

Provides controls to set the bone lengths for the pelvis, IK thigh, shin bone, ankle bone and toe bone.

=== Bone IK Solvers ===

Provides controls to set the bone kinematics for the pelvis, leg, ankle, and toe.

=== Hook Out Rotations ===

Provides controls to set the hook out rotations for the thigh, knee, ankle, ball, and toe.

== Preferences ==

Display Bones:
    Toggles the display of bones on the rig.

Display Animation Controls:
    Toggles the display of animation controls on the rig.

Display Proxy Geometry:
    Toggles the display of the proxy geometry for the body part.

Control Scale:
    Modify the per-part control scale.

Control Color:
    Modify the per-part control color.

=== Control Level of Detail ===

These parameters allow you to modify the display of the pelvis, IK foot, IK rotate from toe, IK ball/toe, IK leg twist, FK thigh, FK shin/ankle/toe translate/rotate, and leg curve.
