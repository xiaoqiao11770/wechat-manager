"""The Sound object defines a sound emission point for the Spatial Audio
chop."""

== Introduction ==

    The Sound object defines a sound emission point for the Spatial
    Audio chop. Multiple sound sources can be mixed by one Spatial Audio
    chop to create stereo or surround sound, with special effects like
    the doppler effect, volume loss over distance, obstacle
    interference, atmospheric filtering and positional audio.

    To setup a Spatial Audio scene, one or more Sound objects should be
    used to emit sound. At least one microphone is needed to capture the
    sound. A SpatialAudio chop is needed to render the sound. If any
    obstacles or filters are used, at least one Acoustic chop is needed
    to design the spectrum filter.

    Moving Sound and Microphone objects around will produce variations
    in pitch and volume, especially if either object is directional.
    Setting up a directional microphone or sound object is much like
    setting up a directional light.

    == Sound ==

        Sound Active:
            #channels: /soundactive

            Turns the sound source on (if greater than zero) or off.
        Volume:
            #channels: /volume

            The volume of the sound source.
        Directional:
            If off, the sound source is non-directional and emits sound
            equally in all directions. Otherwise, the sound source is
            directional and pointed down the negative Z axis. The
            emission cone and outer cone parameters determine the field
            of emission. Any sound emitted from within the emission cone
            have a gain defined by the volume (above). Any sound emitted
            outside the outer cone have a gain defined by the outer
            volume parameter (below). Any sound emitted between the
            recording cone and the outer cone have a gain that is
            interpolated between the two volumes.
        Emission Cone:
            #channels: /emitcone

            Defines the angle of the emission cone, measured from the Z
            axis to the edge of the cone. Setting this to 180 degrees
            will make a non-directional sound source.
        Outer Cone:
            #channels: /outcone

            Defines the dropoff region from the emission cone to the
            outer cone. If the emission cone is set to 60 degrees and
            the outer cone is set to 20 degrees, any sounds emitted from
            more than 80 degrees off the Z axis will fall outside the
            outer cone.
        Dropoff:
            Sets the interpolation type for the dropoff from the
            emission cone volume to the outer volume.
        Dropoff Rate:
            #channels: /droprate

            Increases or decreases the rate of dropoff.
        Outer Volume:
            #channels: /outvolume

            The gain that is applied to any sounds coming from outside
            the outer cone.
        Source CHOP:
            Specifies the CHOP that contains the audio that this Sound
            object is emitted. Only one audio track can be emitted; if
            there is more than one audio track in the CHOP, the first
            one is used.
