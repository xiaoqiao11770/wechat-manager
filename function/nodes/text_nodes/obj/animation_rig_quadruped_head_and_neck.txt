== Animation ==

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for the head and neck controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets the animation parameter values to their default values.

    Controls the stretch ratio for IK body parts.  A value of 0 is no stretch, and a value of 1 is full stretch.  Stretch is a percentage of the distance between the end of the bone and IK control.

The rest of the controls on this tab are for translating and rotating different parts of the head and neck.
    
== Rigging ==

Hook Object:
    The path of the hook object.
    
    NOTE:
        The hook object provides parent transforms to the body part. 
        
Hook Controls:  
    References to global character placer so the head and neck move relative to it.
    
=== Pretransforms ===

Provides controls to change the pretransform positions of the parts of the head and neck.

=== Bone Lengths ===
Provides controls to set the bone lengths for the head and neck bones.

=== Kinematic Solvers ===
