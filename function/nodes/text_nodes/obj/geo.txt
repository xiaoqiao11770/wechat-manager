= Geometry =

"""Container for the geometry operators (SOPs) that define a modeled
object."""

The Geo object represents a high-level modeled object, such as a
character or a prop. It contains geometry operators that define its
shape.

== RIB output ==

When generating subdivision surface meshes for RIB output, this node
checks for an integer detail or integer primitive attribute named
`interpolateboundary`. If the detail attribute exists, the node
turns `interpolateboundary` flag on in the RIB stream for all
subdivision meshes in the geometry. If any primitive has an integer
value larger than 0 for the attribute, the sub-division mesh to
which it belongs will have the flag on.
