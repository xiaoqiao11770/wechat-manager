= Animation Rig Biped Arm =

"""Provides parameters to animate the arm for a biped character."""

@parameters

Display Bodypart:
     Toggles the display of proxy geometry for the spine.
    
== Animation ==

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for the arm controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets the animation parameter values to their default values.

FK/IK Blend:
    Blends between forward and inverse kinematic solutions.

Match FK to IK:
    Matches the FK rotations to the IK solver end positions.

Match IK to FK:
    Matches the IK solver end positions to the FK rotations.

Stretch Ratio:
    Controls the stretch ratio for IK body parts.  A value of 0 is no stretch, and a value of 1 is full stretch.  Stretch is a percentage of the distance between the end of the bone and IK control.

Custom Control Space:
    Provides a custom control space to IK solutions.  This allows you to lock the controls to an object in world space, independent of the rig space.

Custom Space Blend:
    Blend between the standard and any custom IK space.

Wrist World Space Blend:
    Blend between local and world space for rotations.


Wrist Local Space:
    Blends between local/world space values.

Wrist World Space Rotate:
    Rotation value for when the wrist is in world space.

Gimbal Wrist World Space Rotate:
    An additional world space rotation value to fix gimbal lock if it exists. For more information see: [Using gimbal handles and fixing gimbal lock|/basics/handles]. 

The rest of these parameters provide controls to translate and rotate parts of the arm.

=== FK Stretch Controls ===

Provides controls to FK stretch controls for translating the forearm, wrist, and arm curve.
    
== Rigging ==

Hook Object:
    The path of the hook object.
    
    NOTE:
        The hook object provides parent transforms to the body part. 

Hook Controls:  
    References to global character placer so the arm moves relative to it.

Side:
    Determines if the arm is the left or right arm of the character.

=== Pretransforms ===

Provides controls to change the pretransform positions of the parts of the arm.
    
=== Bone Rotations ===

Provides controls to rotate the collarbone, shoulderblade, upperarm, and forearm.

=== Bone Rest Angles ===

Provides controls to set the bone rest angles for the collarbone, shoulderblade, upperarm, and forearm.

=== Bone Lengths ===

Provides controls to set the bone lengths for the collarbone, shoulderblade, upperarm, and forearm.

=== Bone Kinematic ===

Provides controls to set the bone kinematics for the collarbone, shoulderblade, upperarm, and forearm.

=== Hook Out Rotations ===

Provides controls to set the hook out rotations for the collarbone, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and shoulderblade.

== Preferences ==

Display Bones:
    Toggles the display of bones on the rig.

Display Animation Controls:
    Toggles the display of animation controls on the rig.

Display Proxy Geometry:
    Toggles the display of the proxy geometry for the body part.

Control Scale:
    Modify the per-part control scale.

Control Color:
    Modify the per-part control color.

=== Control Level of Detail ===

These parameters allow you to modify the display of the collarbone, FK upperarm,
gimbal FK upperarm, FK forearm translate, FK forearm, FK wrist translate, wrist twist local space, wrist local space, gimbal wrist world space, IK wrist, IK shoulderblade, IK twist shoulderblade, IK twist, and arm curve.
