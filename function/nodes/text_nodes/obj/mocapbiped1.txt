"""A male character with motion captured animations."""

This asset is a male character with various animation mocap cycles (walk, run, zombie, limping, standing, swatfeet, wait, walkbackwards, salsa, breakdance). It has 4 variations on clothing and 10 different textures. You can also supply your own custom texture.

This asset is designed for mid to distance shots or pre-visualization work where an animated character is required.

"Mocap biped 1" and "Mocap biped 2" have different textures and animations. You can use them to test variation in a crowd scene.

Biped 1 has animation on the bones and Biped 2 has animation on nulls (since it was imported from an FBX file).
