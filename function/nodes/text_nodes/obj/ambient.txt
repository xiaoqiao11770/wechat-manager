= Ambient Light =

"""Adds a constant level of light to every surface in the scene (or in the light's mask), coming from no specific direction."""

@parameters

    Ambient Color:
        Light color

    Light Intensity:
        A scale on the color. If the intensity is 0, the light disabled. The
        light will only be sent to the renderer if the object is included in
        the "Force Lights" parameter of the output driver.

    Light Enabled:
        Turning this toggle off is equivalent to setting the light intensity to
        0.

    Enable Light In Viewport:
	Turning this off removes the light from consideration in the
	viewport.  This is useful for lights which only make sense at
	render time.
