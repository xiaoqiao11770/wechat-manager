"""The Switcher operation is used to create a new object that allows you
to switch easily between several cameras."""

The Switcher operation is used to create a new object that allows you to
switch easily between several cameras.

You select the cameras that you wish to switch between. Once the objects
are selected, right-click to complete the operation. There are no
handles associated with this operation.

The operation controls bar above the viewport contains a parameter which
lets you switch between the various input cameras. The Switcher object
gets all its viewing parameters from the currently selected input
camera.

You can specify a different set of parent cameras by hitting the
Reselect Geometry button or typing `${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If
Secure Selection is turned off, selecting one or more new cameras will
immediately complete the selection and connect the new parents.
Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type. The current operation will be exited immediately.
