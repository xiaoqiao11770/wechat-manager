The Null operation is used to create an object that is most often used
to provide control over the transforms of other objects. Null objects
are not rendered, but they have full transforms and so can be used as
parents for other objects, or serve as the end affector for Inverse
Kinematics bone chains.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new Null
object, and right-click to complete the operation. The new Null object
appears with a transform handle that can be used to change its position
and orientation. The translate and rotate parameters also appear in the
operation controls bar above the viewport.

You can change the Null object's parent object any time by hitting the
Reselect Geometry button or typing `${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If
Secure Selection is turned off, selecting a new object will immediately
complete the selection and connect the new parent. Otherwise, you
right-click to signify that the object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
