"""PathCV tool creates control vertices used by the Path tool."""

PathCV tool creates control vertices used by the Path tool.

The geometry created by the PathCV tool has normal and twist attributes.
The normal specifies the orientation, while the twist attributes are
used to determine the correct direction of the normal when the control
vertex becomes a part of the path. The initial twist defines the control
vertex twist at the path creation time. The twist defines the control
vertex twist induced by the rotation of the handles after the the path
was created.
