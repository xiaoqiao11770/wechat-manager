The Bone operation is used to create a new Bone object that can be used
as part of a bone chain to do forward or inverse kinematics.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new Bone
object, and right-click to complete the operation. The new Bone object
appears with handles that can adjust the length of the bone, or its
rotation angles. The length and rotation parameters are also available
in the operation controls bar above the viewport.

When creating bone chains, it is almost always best to use the Bones
operation, which can be used to quickly create entire bone chains and
set up kinematic solvers for the bones.

You can change the Bone object's parent object any time by hitting the
Reselect Geometry button or typing `${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If
Secure Selection is turned off, selecting a new object will immediately
complete the selection and connect the new parent. Otherwise, you
right-click to signify that the object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
