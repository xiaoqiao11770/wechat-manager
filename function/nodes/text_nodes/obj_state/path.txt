"""The Path tool allows to create an oriented curve (path)."""

The Path tool allows to create an oriented curve (path). The orientation
is defined by the normals of the control vertices. The control vertices
can be rotated by an arbitrary angle (even more than 360) and the
orientation on the curve between the control vertices will be
interpolated using a flexible rope metaphor.

The geometry created by the Path tool has normal and twist attributes.
The normal specifies the orientation, while the twist attributes are
used to determine the correct direction of the normal. The initial twist
defines the path twist distribution at the path creation time. The twist
defines the curve twist induced by the rotation of the handles after the
path was created.

An oriented path created by the Path tool can be used, for example, in
the Bones From Curve tool. The bones created from a path will flow
naturally following the path orientation.
