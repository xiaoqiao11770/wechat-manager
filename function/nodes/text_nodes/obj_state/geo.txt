"""The Geometry operation is used to create a new piece of geometry for
your scene."""

The Geometry operation is used to create a new piece of geometry for
your scene. Use this operation to create the objects in your scene that
will appear when rendering your scene.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new
Geometry object, and right-click to complete the operation. The new
Geometry object appears with a transform handle that can be used to
change the position and orientation of the geometry. The translate and
rotate parameters also appear in the operation controls bar above the
viewport.

To edit the geometry itself, select Model Current Object from the
viewport menu. Or you can right-click on any object, and choose Model
This Object from the popup menu.

You can change the Geometry object's parent object any time by hitting
the Reselect Geometry button or typing
`${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If Secure Selection is turned off,
selecting a new object will immediately complete the selection and
connect the new parent. Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the
object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
