= Ambient Light =

"""The Ambient Light operation is used to add ambient illumination to
your scene."""

The Ambient Light operation is used to add ambient illumination to your
scene. An Ambient Light lights all objects in a scene evenly. It is
generally good to have one Ambient Light in the scene.

Although Ambient Light objects do not have transform parameters, it is
still possible to select a parent object for the new light. Once the
parent object (if any) is selected, right-click to complete the
operation.

This operation has no handles associated with it, but the color of the
light can be specified in the operation controls bar immediately above
the viewport.

You can change the Ambient Light's parent object any time by hitting
the Reselect Geometry button or typing
`${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If Secure Selection is turned off,
selecting a new object will immediately complete the selection and
connect the new parent. Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the
object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
