""" The DOP Network operation is used to create a dynamics simulation.
"""

The DOP Network operation is used to create a new dynamics simulation.
The simulation is initialized and controlled using DOP nodes inside the
DOP Network. Simulations can include rigid body dynamics, cloth, wires,
particle systems, or custom dynamics solvers.

Simulations exist at the object level, and so can be transformed like
any other object. You select the object that will be used as the parent
for the new DOP Network object, and right-click to complete the
operation. The new DOP Network object appears with a transform handle
that can be used to change its overall position and orientation.

You can change the DOP Network object's parent object any time by
hitting the Reselect Geometry button or typing
'${h.pane.gview.redoselection}'. If Secure Selection is turned off,
selecting a new object will immediately complete the selection and
connect the new parent. Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the
object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
