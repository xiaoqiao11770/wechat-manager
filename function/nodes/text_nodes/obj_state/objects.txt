"""The Objects operation is used to manipulate the handles of several
objects at the same time."""

The Objects operation is used to manipulate the handles of several
objects at the same time. By providing one handle for each selected
object, this operation allows more flexibility than the Transform
operation which provides a single handle to manipulate all selected
objects.

Select the objects you want to manipulate, and right-click to complete
the operation. You will be presented with handles for each object in the
selection. The handles are created based on the manipulator bindings
defined for each object. Most object have a transform handle, but some
(such as the Bone object) have handles more specifically suited to the
object.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object or
group of objects in the viewport. Handles will immediately appear for
this new set of objects. You can also select objects in a network
editor, and the handles will appear for this new selection.
