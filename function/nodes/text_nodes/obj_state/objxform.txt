"""The Transform operation is used to move, rotate."""

The Transform operation is used to move, rotate. or scale objects. You
can manipulate either single objects or groups of objects using a single
transform handle. There is also an option in the Operation Controls
toolbox to have separate handles for each selected object.

You select the objects to transform, and right-click to complete the
operation. A single transform handle will appear. Manipulating this
transform handle will change the transforms of all selected objects in
their local space.

If multiple objects are selected, and one selected object is the parent
of another selected object, the transform handle will recognize this
fact. The object translations will be set such that the group of
selected objects will behave as if it were a single piece of geometry.
From the right-mouse menu on the transform handle, you can enable Ignore
Parenting. Doing so will cause the transform handle to ignore the
parenting of the selected geometry. This mimics the behavior of the
Transform handle in Houdini 4.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object or
group of objects in the viewport. The transform handle will immediately
become attached to this new selection of objects. You can also select
objects in a network editor, and the transform handle will attach to
this new selection of objects.
