"""The Handle operation is used to create a new Handle object."""

The Handle operation is used to create a new Handle object. Handle
objects are used to control the motion of bones using motion capture
data. Each Handle object represents a control point in the motion
capture data, and can influence the motion of a particular bone object.
Generally, you will use one of the motion capture conversion
applications to generate a script that creates these objects. You will
not generally create objects of this type manually.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new Handle
object, and right-click to complete the operation. There are no handles
associated with this operation.

The operation controls bar above the viewport provides access to the
Target and Translate parameters of the Handle object.

You can change the Handle object's parent object any time by
[reselecting geometry|/basics/select]. If Secure Selection is turned
off, selecting a new object will immediately complete the selection and
connect the new parent. Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the
object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
