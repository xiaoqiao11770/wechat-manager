"""The Force operation is used to create an object level representation
of a force that can be referenced by a Force POP."""

The Force operation is used to create an object level representation of
a force that can be referenced by a Force POP. It can also be used to
represent a constraint force used by the Constraint POP. The most common
use for this object is to provide control for Rigid Body Dynamics
simulations.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new Force
object, and right-click to complete the operation. The new Force object
appears with a transform handle to modify the direction and magnitude of
the force. The rotate and scale parameters are also available in the
operation controls bar above the viewport.

You can change the Force object's parent object any time by hitting the
Reselect Geometry button or typing `${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If
Secure Selection is turned off, selecting a new object will immediately
complete the selection and connect the new parent. Otherwise, you
right-click to signify that the object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
