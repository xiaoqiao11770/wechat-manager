"""The Atmosphere operation is used to create atmospheric effects in
your scene that appear when the scene is rendered."""

The Atmosphere operation is used to create atmospheric effects in your
scene that appear when the scene is rendered.

You select the object that will be used as the parent for the new
Atmosphere object, and right-click to complete the operation.

You can change the Atmosphere object's parent object any time by
hitting the Reselect Geometry button or typing
`${h.pane.gview.redoselection}`. If Secure Selection is turned off,
selecting a new object will immediately complete the selection and
connect the new parent. Otherwise, you right-click to signify that the
object selection is complete.

If Secure Selection is turned off, you can select any other object in
the viewport. Doing so will switch to the operation appropriate for that
object type, and the current operation will be exited immediately.
