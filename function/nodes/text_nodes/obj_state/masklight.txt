"""Sets light, shadow, and reflection masks interactively in the
viewer."""

The Mask Light tool lets you set up light, shadow, and reflection
relationships by selecting objects in the object (OBJ) level viewer.

See [light linking|/render/lights]  and the [link editor
pane|/ref/panes/linker] .

# Make sure the operation controls toolbar is visible.

# In the operation control toolbar, choose the __Link type__ (light,
  shadow, or reflection).

# Choose the __Mode__. Light-centric lets you select the light, and
  then the objects it should affect. Object-centric lets you select
  an object, then the lights it's affected by.

# Choose the __Operation__ (link, unlink, or replace any existing
  links with ones you make now with this tool).

# Follow the prompts at the bottom of the main window.

  yellow.
