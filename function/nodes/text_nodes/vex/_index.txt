These nodes are containers for VOP networks. [VOPs|/nodes/vop] are nodes that
represent functions in the [VEX language|/vex]. VOP networks can perform various
functions, such as computing surface shading, displacement, or defining new
compositing nodes.

The type of VEX network you create controls what the VOP network
inside does (for example, a surface shader) and what VOPs are available inside
(for example, VOP networks for defining shaders use different VOP nodes than VOP
networks for defining compositing nodes).

Right-click a network in the network editor pane and use the context menu to
compile it into a new node type or (in the case of shader networks)
create a one-off shader using the network.

NOTE:
    The network node's comment becomes the help page for any shader or node
    type created from the network.
    See [how to write wiki-format help|/help/format].
