= VEX Subnetwork =

"""This network contains other VOP networks."""

This network contains other VOP networks. It is not able to generate VEX
code because it contains no VOP operators directly.

Use this operator to help organize large numbers of VOP networks. For
example, there could be one SubNetwork to contain all the shading VOP
networks, and another to contain all the operator VOP networks.
