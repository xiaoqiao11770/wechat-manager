"""This network defines a CVEX shader (SHOP)."""

CVEX is VEX code that runs outside a context. 

* In other uses of VEX, such as shaders, Houdini provides many functions and predefined variables related to the context such as Cd for the diffuse color in the surface shader context.

* CVEX doesn't have predefined variables. It is just a program that Houdini calls with certain arguments (usually corresponding to points or data on points). 

For example, you can use a CVEX shader to modify guide hairs for fur. Houdini calls the CVEX program with all the attributes on the geometry and the program can modify them, such as `P` to modify point positions. 

For more information on this subject, see [CVEX shaders for fur|/fur/cvex].
