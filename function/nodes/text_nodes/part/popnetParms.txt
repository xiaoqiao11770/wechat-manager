== Standard == (popnetStandardTab)

    Start Time:
        #channels: /timestart

        Time at which simulation starts, based on seconds using the FPS of the scene.
    Preroll Time:
        #channels: /timepreroll

        At start time, simulation has already been running this long
    Initial State:
        Geometry to use as initial state of simulation
    Random Seed:
        #channels: /seed

        This value is used to initialize the pseudo-random sequence used
        by the simulation. It is useful for generating different
        simulations from the same network.
    Oversampling:
        #channels: /oversample

        How many times to cook in between frames
    Max # of Particles:
        #channels: /maxparticles

        Controls the maximum number of particles that can exist in the
        simulation at any given moment. A value of 0 means particles can
        always be birthed.
    Remove Unused Points:
        Remove the points associated with dead particles. This can
        reduce the memory footprint of the simulation. On the other
        hand, disabling this option can improve performance by recycling
        points. Changing this option can affect the point numbers
        associated with individual particles.

== Input Geo == (popnetInputGeoTab)

    SOP N:
        The path to a SOP to use as Context Geometry <<N>>.

        The display or render SOP can be specified using paths of the
        form <<object_path>>/__display_sop__ or
        <<object_path>>/__render_sop__, respectively.


== RBD == (popnetRbdTab)

    Rest Threshold:
        #channels: /restthreshold

        The minimum relative velocity two RBD particles must have to be
        considered colliding.
    Contact Tolerance:
        #channels: /contacttol

        The distance at which RBD particles are treated as being in
        contact.
    Max Time Splits:
        #channels: /maxdivisions

        A measure of how accurately RBD collisions should be detected.
    Constraint Time:
        #channels: /constrainttime

        Approximate time allowed to satisfy RBD constraints.
    Solver Type:
        Type of solver to be used by the RBD solver.
