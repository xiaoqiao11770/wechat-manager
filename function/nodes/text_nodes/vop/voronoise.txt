"""Computes 1D, 3D, and 4D Voronoi noise, which is similar to Worley
noise but has additional control over jittering."""

This operator computes 1D, 3D, and 4D Voronoi noise, which is similar to
Worley noise but has additional control over jittering (i.e. how
randomly the points are scattered through space) and returns the actual
locations of the two nearest points.

Voronoi noise works by scattering points randomly through space
according to a nice Poisson distribution, generating cell-like patterns.
The generated noise is not anti-aliased. For best shading results, use
the anti-aliased Celluar Noise instead.

Though this operator is slightly more expensive than Worley noise, the
fact that it computes the actual point positions allows it to overcome
some of the artifacts of Worley noise, such as getting even widths along
the cell boundaries.

You can look at dist1 as the amount of generated noise (see other
pattern generators such as Boxes or Stripes), which can be connected to
a mixing bias (see [Mix|Node:vop/mix]), a displacement amount (see Displace Along
Normal), or other float inputs.

The seed associated with the first closest point is also returned. The
seed is pretty much guaranteed to be unique for every point, meaning
that it is unlikely that two points close by will have the same seed
associated with them.

If the periodicity (`period`) input is connected, periodicity will be
factored into the noise computation.

The relative costs for computing noise of different types is roughly:

{{{
Cost | Noise Type
-----+-------------------------
 1.0 | Perlin Noise             (see Periodic  Noise operator)
 1.1 | Original Perlin Noise    (see Turbulent Noise operator)
 1.8 | Worley Noise             (see Worley    Noise operator)
 1.9 | Voronoi Noise
 2.1 | Sparse Convolution Noise (see Turbulent Noise operator)
 2.3 | Alligator Noise          (see Turbulent Noise operator)
