= Color Correction =

"""Provides a means to change the hue, saturation, intensity, bias, gain and gamma of the input color."""

This operator provides a means to change the hue, saturation, intensity, bias, gain and gamma of the input color. Hue and saturation will *not* work on a _greyscale_ input color. The changes cascade through the parameters in the order listed.


@inputs

Color In:
        The color to be corrected.

Hue Shift:
        This value is the distance and direction along the color wheel to shift the input color. However there must be some hue to start with. The value should be a number between -1 and 1.

Saturation:
        This value increases or decreases the saturation of the input color.  However there must be some color to start with. Saturation is multiplicative, so zero saturation will return zero saturation.

Intensity:
        This value increases or decreases the intensity of the input color.  Intensity is multiplicative, so black will return black.

Bias:
        This value increases or decreases the bias for any of the RGB channels of the input color individually. 0.5 is no change.

Gain:
        This value increases or decreases the gain for any of the RGB channels of the input color individually. 0.5 is no change.

Gamma:
        This value shifts the overall gamma of the input color. 1 is no change. Values less than 1 will _"push"_ the color down and values greater than 1 will _"pull"_ the color up.

@outputs

Color Out:
        The new corrected color.
