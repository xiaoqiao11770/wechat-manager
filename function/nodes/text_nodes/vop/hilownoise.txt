= High-Low Noise =

"""Computes a mix of high and low frequency, anti-aliased noise with a
wide range of applications."""

This operator computes a mix of high and low frequency, anti-aliased
noise with a wide range of applications.

Connect the noise output to the [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] bias or to [Displace Along
Normal|Node:vop/displacenml] to obtain interesting results. The options are boundless.

If the Surface Position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable
by the same name will be used instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as `P` inputs. If you do need `P`, you will
find it in the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.

TIP:
    You may have to turn up the chip amount up to 100 or more
    before you see any effect.
