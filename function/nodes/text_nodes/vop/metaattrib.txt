= Metaball Attribute =

"""Returns the value of the given point attribute at the specified
position in the metaball field."""

This operator returns the value of the given point attribute at the
specified position in the metaball field.

The operator is typically used inside a Point Loop construct to query
the contribution of the current point. Note that when using this
operator inside a Point Loop, the attribute is not pre-blended by the
density of the metaball.

If the `P` input is not connected, the global variable by the same name
will be used instead.
