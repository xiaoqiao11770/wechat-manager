"""Simulates car paint with embedded metallic flakes and a coat layer."""

@parameters

== Base ==

Color:
    #id: basecolor
    Controls the metallic base layer's color.

Reflectivity:
    #id: basereflect
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/principledshader#reflect

Roughness:
    #id: baserough
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/principledshader#rough

== Flakes ==

Color:
    #id: flakecolor
    The color of metallic flakes

Frequency:
    #id: flakefreq
    Spatial frequency of the flakes.

Size:
    #id: flakesize
    The relative size of the flakes.

Falloff:
    #id: flakefalloff
    The edges of flakes are faded over this distance.

Random Normal:
    #id: flakerandomnormal
    Randomness of the normals, at a value of 1, they are randomized by up to `90` degrees.

Reflectivity:
    #id: flakereflect
    The reflectiveness of flakes facing the viewer.

Roughness:
    #id: flakerough
    The roughness of the flakes, see __Roughness__ for more details.

== Coat ==

Color:
    #id: coatcolor
    The color of the coat reflection layer.

Reflectivity:
    #id: coatreflect
    The reflectivity of the coat reflection layer, see __Reflectivity__ for more details.

Roughness:
    #id: coatrough
    The roughness of the coat reflection layer, see __Roughness__ for more details.
