"""Returns texture coordinates or geometric s and t, depending on what is defined."""

This VOP checks if texture coordinates are defined for the geometry. If so, the those coordinate are returned, otherwise the global _s_ and _t_ are returned. For some geometry, polygons in particular, the global _s_ and _t_ may not give the desired results. A [UV Texture SOP|Node:sop/texture] will define more desirable U and V texture coordinates.

@outputs

uv:
    This is the uvw vector.

s:
    This is the U texture coordinate or global _s_, depending on what is defined.

t:
    This is the V texture coordinate or global _t_, depending on what is defined.
