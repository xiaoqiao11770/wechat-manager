= Point Cloud Import by Index =

"""This node imports point data from a pcopen."""

The Point Cloud Import by Index VOP imports point information outside of [Point Cloud Iterate|Node:vop/pciterate] or [Point Cloud Unshaded|Node:vop/pcunshaded] contexts.  It requires a handle created by [Point Cloud Open|Node:vop/pcopen] and
will return data about the idxth point that was found close to the
query position.  By using this and [Point Number Founds |Node:vop/pcnumfound] you can iterate over found points using a [For VOP|Node:vop/for].
This node corresponds to the pcimportbyidx* family of VEX function.

There are two special channel names you can import:

`point.number`:
    The number of the point being processed.  This works with float or
    integer importing.

`point.distance`:
    The distance of the point being processed from the query point.
    This only works for float importing.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for import.

channel:
    The channel to import.  You should select the data type for the channel
    using the Signature parameter.

idx:
    Which of the found points to import the data from.  Should be
    between 0 and pcnumfound()-1.

@outputs

data:
    The data imported from the point cloud.
