= Environment Map =

"""Sets the environment map (on an infinite sphere) and returns its
color."""

This operator sets the environment map (on an infinite sphere) and
returns its color. If the image does not have an alpha channel
associated with it (e.g. a JPEG image) and the operator returns RGBA,
the alpha component will be set to 1.

See [how to create an environment/reflection map|/render/envmaps].

@parameters
    Signature:
        RGB or RGBA values.
    Environment Map:
        Image file to use as environment map.
    Wrap:
        Determines how the image is evaluated when the texture
        coordinates are outside the range 0 to 1. The options are:

        Repeat:
            (string value `repeat`). The image map repeats outside the
            range 0 the range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer component
            of the texture coordinate is ignored.
        Streak:
            (string value `streak`). Texture coordinates are clamped to
            the 0 to 1 range.
        Decal:
            (string value `decal`). Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1
            will evaluate to the border color rather than an image
            color.
    Filter Type:
        type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation. The
        options are:

        Box:
            (string value `box`)
        Gaussian:
            (string value `gauss`)
        Bartlett/Triangular:
            (string value `bartlett`)
        Sinc Sharpening:
            (string value `sinc`)
        Hanning:
            (string value `hanning`)
        Blackman:
            (string value `blackman`)
        Catmull-Rom:
            (string value `catrom`)
        Mitchell:
            (string value `mitchell`)
        Point Sampling:
            (string value `point`)
    Filter Width:
	Blurs the environment map based on derivatives in shading contexts.  For contexts that do not provide derivatives, such as the sop context, this parameter will have no effect and you should instead use __Texture Blur__ or __Pixel Blur__.  In shading contexts, filtering will be proportional to the micropolygon size, with a filter width of 1 filtering one micropolygon.
    Filter Angle:
	Half angle in degrees over which the environment map should be blurred.
    Border Color:
        Border color when Decal wrapping is used.
    Extrapolate Derivatives:
        Specifies whether derivative extrapolation should be used when
        computing anti-aliasing information.
    Interpolate MIP Levels:
        Specifies whether RAT files should interpolate between different
        MIP levels. If enabled, it will help remove discontinuities when
        different MIP levels of a RAT file are accessed. However, the
        results of texture evaluation will be slightly softer (i.e.
        blurrier) and will take twice as long to compute.
