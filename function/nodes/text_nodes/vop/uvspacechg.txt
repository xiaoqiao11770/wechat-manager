"""Performs various space conversions of 3D positional data for uv
shading purposes."""

This operator performs various space conversions of 3D positional data
for uv shading purposes. The available space conversions are:

{{{
Texture                       (string value "texture")
Object                        (string value "object")
Normalized Device Coordinate  (string value "ndc")
World (Unchanged)             (string value "world")
}}}

The `Texture` option takes a position in world space and converts it to
shader space. The `Object` option takes a position in world space and
converts it to object space. The `NDC` option takes a position in world
space and puts it in the normalized device coordinate space (screen
space). The `World` option leaves the incoming data untouched.

The output of this operator is typically connected to a [Parameter|Node:vop/parameter] node
bound to the `rest` attribute, or to a modifier node such as [UV
Transform|Node:vop/uvxform] or [Anti-Aliased Noise|Node:vop/aanoise].

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead.
