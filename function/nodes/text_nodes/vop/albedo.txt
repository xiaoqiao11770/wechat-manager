"""Compute the reflectivity of a bsdf."""

This node will compute the reflectivity or diffuse albedo of a bsdf.  The
reflectivity is computed as an average over all incident lighting angles,
meaning that if you placed the surface under a uniform environment light
(intensity 1) the albedo is the color reflected toward the viewer.

@parameters

== Bounce Components ==

A list of one, or more, bounce components to evaluate when computing the 
albedo.

Diffuse:
    #id: diffuse_comp
    
    The albedo computed will include diffuse bounces.

Glossy:
    #id: glossy_comp
    
    The albedo computed will include glossy bounces. Glossy includes the 
    specular, reflection and refraction components.

Volume:
    #id: volume_comp
    
    The albedo computed will include volumetric bounces.

@inputs

f:
    The bsdf for which the albedo should be computed.

nI:
    A normalized incident ray direction.

@outputs

albedo:
    The albedo for all color components.
