= Image 3D Iso-Texture Procedural =

"""This procedural will generate an iso-surface from a 3D texture image (.i3d file)."""

If the bounding box is not specified for the procedural, the bounding box of the texture map will be use.

@parameters

== Main ==

I3D File:
    Specifies the .i3d file to generate an iso-surface from.

Density Channel:
    The name of the density channel.

Density Threshold:
    The density threshhold at which to generate the iso-surface.

Level Of Detail: 
    Specify an alternate level of detail for the polygonization of the texture.

Filter: 
    Specifies the type of filter to be used in evaluation of the texture. Choose between: Point (no filter), Box, Gaussian, Barlett/Triangular. Sinc Sharpening, Hamming, Blackman, and Catmull-Rom.

Filter Width:
    A float representing the filter width in both x and y directions. The filter width is used for analytic texture filtering across micropolygons when using micropolygon rendering. Typically you should use a width of 1.

== IFD Bounds ==

Bounding Box:
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding Box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.

SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
