"""Creates, modifies, or de-structures an instance of a structured datatype."""

== How to ==

See [VOP structs|/vex/vop_structs] for more information on using structs in VOPs.

You can use this node in three main ways:

* Create an instance of a defined struct type.

    In the parameter editor, choose a defined struct type.
    Wire the values for the members into the inputs.
    The first output is a struct of the given type.

* Set the value of a member of a struct.

    Wire an existing struct into the first input.
    Wire the value(s) you want to change into the input(s).
    The first output is the struct with the new values.

* You can extract the values of the members of a struct.

    Wire an existing struct into the first input.
    The extra outputs contain the values of the struct members.

== Defined types ==

* To define a struct type, click __Edit__ in the parameter editor.
  See the [VOP structure editor|/ref/windows/edit_vop_struct] for
  how to use the editor.

* See [defined type storage|/vex/vop_structs#json] for
  information on how and where the defined types are stored.

* To create an ad-hoc struct without defining it first, use the
  [Struct Pack node|Node:vop/structpack] instead.

@parameters

Struct Name:
    The name of a struct definition to require for the input.
    If you choose "Auto detect", the input will accept any struct,
    and the output type will automatically change to match the input.

Edit:
    Opens the [VOP struct editor|/ref/windows/edit_vop_struct].
    You can use this to define new struct datatypes.
