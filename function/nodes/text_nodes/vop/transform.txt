= Transform =

"""Transforms a vector to or from an object's transform space, or one of several other spaces, such as world or camera space."""

You can set the input values as parameters or override them by connecting nodes to the Transform VOP's inputs.

You can transform from/to the space of an object by entering the path to the object in the __From space__ or __To space__ parameters. Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser icon beside the parameter to choose the node from a tree. You can also choose one of the following spaces. 

* `space:world` - World space.
* `space:camera` - Camera space.
* `space:object` - Object space.
* `space:ndc` - NDC space.
* `space:current` - The current space of the vector.
* `space:light` - The space of the current light. Only available in light and shadow shaders.
* `space:lightndc` - NDC space of the current light. Only available in light and shadow shaders.

@parameters

3D entity value:
    The position, direction vector, or normal to transform.
    
Interpretation:
    How to treat the values in the __3D entity value__ parameter: as a position, direction vector, or normal.
    
From space:
    The path of an object, or space name, to transform from.
    
To space:
    The path of an object, or space name, to transform to.

@outputs

Transformed 3D entity:
    The transformed position, direction, or normal.
