= Anti-Aliased Noise =

"""Generates anti-aliased noise by using the derivative information of the incoming position to compute band-limited noise."""

This operator generates anti-aliased (fractional brownian motion) noise
by using the derivative information of the incoming position to compute
band-limited noise. This type of noise is ideal for shading.

The roughness parameter determines the coarseness of the noise. The
maxoctaves parameter limits the noise to a fixed number of iterations.

The amplitude parameter is a scale factor on the resulting noise. The default output range of noise is -0.5 to 0.5. 

Make sure at least the Position (`pos`) input is connected in order to
notice any noise. The easiest way to accomplish this is to pipe the
global variable `P` into the `pos` input. However, the global variable
is in camera space, so noise will move through the surface.

To fix this use the [Rest Position VOP|Node:vop/restpos] (for deforming geometry) or
simply transform the position to object space using the [Transform VOP|Node:vop/transform].

Connect the noise output to the Color Mix bias or to Displace Along
Normal to obtain interesting results. The options are boundless.
