= Metaball Density =

"""Returns the density of the metaball field at the specified
position."""

This operator returns the density of the metaball field at the specified
position.

The operator is typically used inside a Point Loop construct to query
the contribution of the current point. If the P input is not connected,
the global variable by the same name will be used instead.
