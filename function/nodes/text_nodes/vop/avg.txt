= Average =

"""Outputs the average of its inputs."""

This operator outputs the average of its inputs.

The first input can be an integer, float, vector, vector4, matrix3, or
matrix. The allowed data types of subsequent inputs depend on the data
type of the first input. For example, if the first input is a float,
subsequent inputs can be either floats or integers. The output data type
is always the same as the data type for the first input.


@inputs
    Input Number 1...N:
        The input values to be averaged together.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.

@outputs
    Combined Value:
        The average of all the input values.
