"""Generates a color using the Oren-Nayar diffuse lighting model calculation."""

This is a more sophisticated diffuse calculation than Lambert's. It provides a roughness exponent to control the spread of the diffuse contribution. Typically its color is the main surface color of the material. This lighting model is often used for materials with no specular contribution, such as clay or chalk or matte paint.

@inputs

nN:
    The normal vector is used in the Oren-Nayar diffuse calculation.
	The normal should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input, 
	and front-face calculation is optional but recommended. 
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `N`, is used.

nI:
    The incidence direction ray used in the Oren-Nayar diffuse calculation,
	and the face forward calculation.
	The incident vector should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input. 
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `I`, is used.

Kd:
    The diffuse intensity.
	A floating point value used to darken or lighten diffuse contribution. 

diff:
    The diffuse color. This color is most often the main surface color of the material.

rough:
    A floating point value used to control the size or spread of diffuse contribution. 

facefwd:
    This toggle will change the normal to face forward towards the camera.
	It is recommended this toggle be on.

@outputs

color:
    The Oren-Nayar diffuse color contribution:

    {{{
    Kd * diff * diffuse(nN, -nI, rough)
    }}}

illum:
    Just Oren-Nayar diffuse lighting without the multiplication by the diffuse intensity or the diffuse color.
	Usually used as an export parameter for extra images planes used in the composite.

bsdf:
    The PBR diffuse calculation.
