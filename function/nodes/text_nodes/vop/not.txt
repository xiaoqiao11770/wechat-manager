= Not =

"""This operator performs a logical `not` operation on an integer value,
returning 1 if the input is zero, and 0 if the input is non-zero."""

This operator performs a logical `not` operation on an integer value,
returning 1 if the input is zero, and 0 if the input is non-zero. Only
one operand is accepted.

Typically, `not` is used as an input to conditional operators such as [If|Node:vop/if]
and [While|Node:vop/while].


@parameters
    Bitwise Operation:
	Instead of any non-zero value being treated the same, the input is
	broken into individual bits and the operation performed on them.
