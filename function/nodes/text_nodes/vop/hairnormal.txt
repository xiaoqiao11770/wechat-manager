= Hair Normal =

"""Generates a normal vector which always faces the camera, parallel to the incidence vector."""

This VOP generates a normal specifically for use in the lighting models for curves (hairs). 
This normal is based on the tangent vector of the curve (hair) and will always face the camera,
parallel to the incidence vector.

@inputs

nI:
    The incident direction ray used in the calculation of the curve normal.
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `I`, is used.
	The incident vector should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input. 

nT:
    This is the vector tangent to the curve (hair).
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `dPdt`, is used.
	If a tangent vector is explicitly connected as an input, it must be normalized.

ss:
    This is the `u` texture coordinate attached the curve (hair) primitive.
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `s`, is used.
	This is used if the __Do Rounding__ toggle is on, to give the curve an interpolated normal.
	This gives the appearance of a rounded surface across the curve width.
	
@parameters

bow:
    This is the __Do Rounding__ toggle. If on, it causes the curve to have an interpolated normal.
	This gives the appearance of a rounded surface across curve width, perpendicular to the 
	tangent (length) of the curve (hair). It is recommended this toggle is on.

@outputs

hairNn:
    A normal vector for use with hair lighting models.
