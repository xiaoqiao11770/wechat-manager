= Agent Convert Transforms =

"""Converts transforms between local space and world space for an agent primitive."""

Returns `-1` if the given number of transforms does not match the number of transforms in the agent's rig, the primitive number is out of range, or the primitive is not an agent.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Convert:
    Whether to convert the transforms from world space to local space, or vice versa.

Transforms:
    The transforms to convert.
