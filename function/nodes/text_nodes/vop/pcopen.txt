= Point Cloud Open =

"""This node opens a point cloud file and searches for points around a source position."""

This VOP opens a point cloud file (`.pc`) and queues up access to the
points centered around a certain location.  The pcopen VOP invokes the
underlying [Vex:pcopen] VEX function.

@inputs

file:
    The name of the file to load.  Point cloud files use the .pc extension,
    but it is also possible to load geometry files as point clouds.

pchannel:
    The name of the channel in the texture which contains the position to
    be searched.

P:
    The query position.  The search for points in the file will begin at
    this position.

nchannel:
    Optionally, a normal channel can be provided to restrict the point
    search to points whose normal aligns with the search normal <<N>>.

N:
    The query normal.  Points with `dot(N, Npoint) > cos(cone)` will be
    queued, and unmatched points will be rejected.

radius:
    The maximum radius around <<P>> that should be searched.  If you know
    that all query points will reside within a given radius, you can speed
    up the search by specifying the radius here.

maxpoints:
    The maximum number of points that will be returned.

cone:
    The maximum cone angle to be used when rejecting points given a search
    normal.

preload:
    A toggle to control whether the entire point cloud file is loaded into
    memory before performing searches.  Disabling preloading will decrease
    performance but may improve memory use.

@outputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle, to be used as input for VOPs which use the
    point cloud such as pcfilter or pciterate.
