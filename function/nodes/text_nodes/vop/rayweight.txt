= Ray Bounce Weight =

"""Returns the amount that the current bounce level will contribute to
the final pixel color."""

This operator returns the amount that the current bounce level will
contribute to the final pixel color.

A primary ray is one sent directly from the camera. It has a bounce
level of 0 and a bounce-weight of 1. After a single reflection, the ray
bounce level is 1. After two reflections, the level is 2, etc. The
weight of each subsequent ray level is determined by the type of surface
it encounters.

For example, assume the primary ray (of weight 1) hits a 0.1 reflective
surface. Reflections in this surface will contribute only 0.1 to the
final pixel color. If a second 0.1 reflective surface is hit, the ray
weight will drop to 0.01.

This operator can be used to do less work for rays which will not
contribute very much to the final output color (i.e. compute fewer
octaves of noise, etc.).
