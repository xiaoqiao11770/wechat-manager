"""Simulates the effect of light reflecting on surfaces with a thin-film
coating."""

This operator simulates the effect of light reflecting on surfaces with
a thin-film coating, such as soap bubbles or sun glasses.

For a more complete model that also computes the Fresnel reflection and
refraction contributions, see the [Glass|Node:vop/glass] operator.

Alpha Para determines the alpha value of the geometry that faces the
camera. Para stands for parallel, which describes roughly how the
Surface Normal (`N`) and the direction from eye to surface are relative to
each other when the geometry faces the camera.

Alpha Perp determines the alpha value of the geometry silhouette, where
the Surface Normal (`N`) is roughly perpendicular to the direction from
eye to surface - hence Alpha "Perp". The higher its value, the glassier
the surface.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the this surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
