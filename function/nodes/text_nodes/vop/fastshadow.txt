= Fast Shadow =

"""Sends a ray from the position `P` along the direction specified by the
direction `D`."""

This operator sends a ray from the position `P` along the direction
specified by the direction `D`. The length of the `D` vector represents the
farthest distance considered when checking for occlusion.

The operator returns 1 if there are no occluding objects found, and 0 0
if the ray hit any object in between.

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead. In the Shadow context, you will normally
connect the global `Ps` variable to the `P` input, and the global `L`
variable to the `dir` input.
