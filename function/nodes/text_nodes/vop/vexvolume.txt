= Vex Volume Procedural =

"""This procedural will generate a volume from a CVEX shader."""

Each export from the shader will be bound to a corresponding vex surface shader parameter, if it exists. If the bounding box is not specified for the procedural, a unit bounding box will be used.

@parameters

== Main ==

Shader:
    The CVEX shader which is used to define the volume. Each parameter export from the shader will be bound to a corresponding VEX surface shader parameter (if it exists).

Octree Divisions:
    Represents the voxel divisions of the volume primitive used for rendering. 

== IFD Bounds ==

Bounding Box:
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding Box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.

SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
