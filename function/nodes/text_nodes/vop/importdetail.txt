= Import Detail Attribute =

Import Detail Attribute can fetch the attribute value from a geometry stored on disk.

@parameters

Signature:
    What type of attribute data to fetch. The attribute should be large enough to fill out the desired size. For example, a vector attribute needs to be a float attribute of size 3. Therefore to fetch color, you'd use __Vector Attribute__.

Default Value:
    If the attribute cannot be imported because it does not exist, or
    is not a compatible type, or the specified element is invalid, this
    will be the resulting value.

Input:
    You can fetch attributes from one of the inputs to the current
    operator rather than a file.  When set to other than File, the Geometry
    File is overridden.  This allows you to refer to a SOP operator without
    the op: or opinput: syntax.

Geometry File:
    The file on disk to fetch an attribute from.

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to fetch. `Cd` fetches the common color attribute, and `P` will fetch point position.
