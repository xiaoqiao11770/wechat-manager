"""Creates 4D noise patterns similar to foam patterns on wind-swept water."""

@parameters

Lace frequency:
    The overall frequency of "foam" in the noise.

Tendril frequency:
    The frequency for foam tendrils.

Offset:
    Offset of the noise function. You can use this to "move" the noise through the three spatial dimensions.

Foam evolution:
    Temporal offset of the noise function. You can use this to animate the foam changing over time.

Increment:
    The size of empty spaces ("lucunarity") in the noise. Increase this parameter to increase the amount of empty space and decrease the amount of foam.

Base:
    Controls the amount of foam.

Edge:
    Controls the amount of foam.
    
Holes:
    Attenuates the noise, affecting the number of boundary spaces.

@outputs

foam:
    The amount of foam at the current point.
