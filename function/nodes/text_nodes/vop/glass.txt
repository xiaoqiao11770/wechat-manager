"""Simulates a translucent material such as glass, and returns the
combined color, opacity, and alpha."""

This operator simulates a translucent material such as glass, and
returns the combined color, opacity, and alpha.

The index of refraction (`eta`) is the most important parameter because it
controls the amount of the transmission (ie. refraction) of the surface.
Its neutral value is 1. The environment color is ignored unless you
specify a valid environment map. The reflection bias is used to help
eliminate self-reflection, and is typically a small number.

In order to prevent the renderer from computing standard transparency
(i.e. non-refracted transparency), as is the case with glass-like
surfaces, the opacity is set internally to 1 to make the surface
"opaque".

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the glass surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need need
to access the global variables directly, they are available from the
[Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
