@parameters

Type:
    #id: type
    The type of operation to perform.

    Bump:
	[Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#displacetype_bump]
    Normal:
	[Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#displacetype_normal]
    Displace Along Normal:
	[Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#displacetype_dispnormal]
    Vector Displacement:
	[Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#displacetype_dispvector]

Space:
    #id: vectorspace
    The space in which the vector-based operations __Normal__ and __Vector Displacement__ are applied.

    UV Tangent Space:
	Use the space defined by the Surface Normal and the UV-tangents. Using this space allows normal textures to be applied to deforming objects, since the vector applied relative to the surface's orientation, rather than simply in object space.
    Object Space:
	Use the object's transform.

Offset:
    #id: offset
    This offset is added to the __value__ before __Effect Scale__ is applied.

Effect Scale:
    #id: scale
    The effect of the operation is scaled by this value.

    In __Normal__ mode, this scales the rotation of normals away form the input normal.

Channel:
    #id: channel
    The component to use with the scalar operations __Bump__ and __Displace Along Normal__.

Normal Space:
    #id: normalspace
    In __Normal__ mode, controls in what format the input is stored.

    0 to 1:
	The components of the normal are in the `0-1` range. This is typically done in textures in order to store values in the positive and visible range.
    -1 to 1:
	The components of the normal are in their natural, normalized state.

Flip X:
    #id: normalflipx
    Flip the input normals in X, before applying the __Vector Space__.

Flip Y:
    #id: normalflipy
    Flip the input normals in Y, before applying the __Vector Space__.
