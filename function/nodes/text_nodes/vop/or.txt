"""This operator performs a logical "or" operation between its inputs and returns 1 or 0 ."""

This operator performs a logical "or" operation between its inputs and
returns 1 (if at least one input is non-zero) or 0 (if all inputs are
zero).

Typically, "or" is used as an input to conditional operators such as If
and While. All inputs and the output data type are integers.

@parameters
    Bitwise Operation:
	Instead of any non-zero value being treated the same, the input is
	broken into individual bits and the operation performed on them.


@inputs
    Input Number 1...N:
        The input values to be combined together.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.
@outputs
    Combined Value:
        The logical "or" combination of all inputs.
