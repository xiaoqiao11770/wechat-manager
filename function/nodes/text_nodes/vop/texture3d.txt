= Texture 3D =

"""Returns the value of a 3D image at a specified position within that
image."""

This operator returns the value of a 3D image at a specified position
within that image.

If the position is outside of the bounding box of the image, the value
returned will be 0. If the channel specified contains more values than
the return type (i.e. a vector channel when a float return type is
desired), the first component of the vector will be returned. If the
channel specified contains fewer values than the return type, the
missing components will be filled with the last valid channel.

Texture files will be searched for in the path specified by the
`HOUDINI_TEXTURE_PATH` environment variable.
