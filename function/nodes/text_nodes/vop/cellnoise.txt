"""Computes 2D, anti-aliased cellular noise suitable for shading."""

This operator computes 2D, anti-aliased cellular noise suitable for
shading. It is similar to Voronoi noise in that it overcomes some of the
artifacts of Worley noise, such as getting even widths along the cell
boundaries. The significant advantage of this noise over both Voronoi
and Worley is that it is anti-aliased.

Cellular noise works by scattering points randomly through space
according to a nice Poisson distribution, generating cell-like
patterns.

You can look at dist1 as the amount of generated noise (see other
pattern generators such as Boxes or Stripes), which can be connected to
a mixing bias (see [Mix|Node:vop/mix]), a displacement amount (see [Displace Along
Normal|Node:vop/displacenml]), or other float inputs.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (s,t) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.
