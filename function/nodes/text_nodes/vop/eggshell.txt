"""Generates an anti-aliased egg-shell material with the typical
egg-shell roughness and lack of specularity."""

This operator generates an anti-aliased egg-shell material with the
typical egg-shell roughness and lack of specularity.

Here are three sets of common egg-shell colors you can use:

{{{
White: 0.985, 0.972, 0.913
        Brown: 0.825, 0.690, 0.580
        Robin: 0.205, 0.910, 0.910
 
}}}
If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the shell surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need need
to access the global variables directly, they are available from the
[Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
