"""Simulates a shiny marble material."""

This operator simulates a shiny marble material.

The Vein Direction (`vdir`) input determines the overall orientation of
the marble veins. To better visualize the general vein orientation, you
can temporarily reduce the Vein Frequency (`vfreq`) and the Noise
Frequency (`nfreq`).

The Vein Frequency (`vfreq`) input controls the number of veins in the
pattern. For wider or thinner veins, vary the Vein Attenuation (`vatten`)
input.

The Groove Depth (`gdepth`) and Groove Threshold (`gthresh`) inputs allow
you to displace the surface along the vein area. A groove depth of zero
will not generate any displacements at all. The threshold is a value
ranging between zero and one that determines the percentage of the veiny
area to be displaced. Alternatively, you can use the Vein Amount output
in a separate displacement shader.

To blend between more than two colors, edit this operator's subnetwork
and replace the [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] operator with a Spline operator and connect
all the color inputs into the Spline's "key" inputs, repeating the first
and last color twice.

If the marble you want to simulate has different material properties on
the base stone than on the veins, eliminate the common [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting]
operator and pipe lit colors into the appropriate Color Mix inputs. The
resulting mix is the final marble color. (A lit color is one that is
output from a Lighting Model.) This allows you, among other things, to
apply different specular and roughness to each marble component, and to
displace either the base stone, the veins, or both in an individual
fashion.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the stone surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
