"""Implements a matte shader that occludes geometry behind the surface
being rendered."""

This operator implements a matte shader that occludes geometry behind
the surface being rendered. The output image, however, will have the
alpha value specified.

The output color is always zero and no lighting is applied.

The operator is well suited to compositing tricks. When the matte shader
is hit by shadow rays, the shadow amount determines how much of a shadow
will be cast by the surface, meaning that both the opacity and alpha
outputs will inherit the shadow amount. When the shader is not hit by
shadow rays, only the alpha output will inherit the shadow, while the
opacity is set to 1.

You will typically connect the color, opacity, and alpha outputs
straight into the `Cf`, `Of`, and respectively `Alpha` inputs of the [Output
Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.

It is also possible to disable fog on the surface. To do so, either use
the [VEX Matte SHOP|Node:shop/v_matte] in the Shaders module, or create a [Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter], set
its type to "Toggle (`int`)", name its parameter "__nofog" (with two
underscores) and enable its Export Parameter option. You do not need
to connect its output to any operator.
