= Texture =

"""Computes a filtered sample of the texture map specified and returns
an RGB or RGBA color."""

This operator computes a filtered sample of the texture map specified
and returns an RGB or RGBA color. If the image does not have an alpha
channel (e.g. a JPEG image) and the operator returns RGBA, the alpha
will be set to 1.

With no texture coordinates given, the values of the global s and t
variables are used to index the texture. If both derivative inputs (ds
and dt) are connected, `s` and `t` will represent the center of a square
whose bottom-left and upper-right corners are (s-ds,t-dt) and (s+ds,
t+dt) respectively .

To layer a texture on top of another using layered texture attributes
already assigned to geometry, pipe the output of the Shading Layer
Parameter into Vector To Float, then connect fval1 and fval2 to this
operator's s and t inputs, choosing the RGBA signature and Decal
wrapping. Then connect the color output to a Vector4 To Vector operator
to separate the RGB from the alpha. Put down a [Mix|Node:vop/mix] operator and connect
the RGB color to input2, the alpha to the bias and any previous
Texture's color to input1. Repeat this procedure as needed.


@parameters
    Signature:
        RGB or RGBA values
    Texture Map:
	#id: map
        The image file to use as a texture map.
    UDIM Filename Expansion:
	#id: udim
	UDIM texture filename expansion. 
	The UDIM coordinate is computed based on the uv-coordinate: `1000 + int(u)+1 + int(v)*10`.
	Example: "map_%(UDIM)d.rat" returns "map_1044.rat" with u=3.1, v=4.15  
    Source Color Space:
	#id: srccolorspace
	The texture's color space.
    S Coordinate:
        S coordinate (or global `s`)
    T Coordinate:
        T coordinate (or global `t`)
    S Derivative:
        Derivative with respect to s (see [UV Project|Node:vop/uvproject])
    T Derivative:
        Derivative with respect to t (see [UV Project|Node:vop/uvproject])
    Wrap:
	#id: wrap
        Determines how the image is evaluated when the texture
        coordinates are outside the range 0-1. The options are:

        Repeat:
            (string value `repeat`). The image map repeats outside the
            range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer component of the texture
	    coordinate is ignored.
        Streak:
            (string value `streak`). Texture coordinates are clamped to
            the 0 to 1 range.
        Decal:
            (string value `decal`). Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1
            will evaluate to the border color rather than an image
            color.
    Filter Type:
	#id: filter
        Type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation. The
        options are:

        Box:
            (string value `box`)
        Gaussian:
            (string value `gauss`)
        Bartlett/Triangular:
            (string value `bartlett`)
        Sinc Sharpening:
            (string value `sinc`)
        Hanning:
            (string value `hanning`)
        Blackman:
            (string value `blackman`)
        Catmull-Rom:
            (string value `catrom`)
        Mitchell:
            (string value `mitchell`)
        Point Sampling:
            (string value `point`)
    Filter Width:
	#id: width
	Blur the texture based on derivatives in shading contexts.  For contexts that do not provide derivatives (such as the sop context), this parameter will have no effect and you should use __Texture Blur__ or __Pixel Blur__ instead.  In shading contexts, filtering will be proportional to the micropolygon size with a filter width of 1, filtering one micropolygon.
    Texture Blur:
	Blur the texture as a percentage of the image width.  The blur is specified as 0 (no blur) to 1 (blur the entire image).
    Pixel Blur:
	Blur the texture by the specified number of pixels.  If the resolution of the map changes, the amount of blur will change.

    Border Color:
        Border color when Decal wrapping is used.
    Extrapolate Derivatives:
        Specifies whether derivative extrapolation should be used when
        computing anti-aliasing information.
    Interpolate MIP Levels:
        Specifies whether RAT files should interpolate between different
        MIP levels. If enabled, it will help remove discontinuities when
        different MIP levels of a RAT file are accessed. However, the
        results of texture evaluation will be slightly softer (i.e.
        blurrier) and will take twice as long to compute.

    Default Color:
        When evaluating decal textures, this is the color evaluated when outside of the decal.

    Texture Channel:
        This specifies which color channel for multi-plane textures should be evaluated.

    PTexture Face: 
        When evaluating ptex files, the polygon face used to index into the map. This will default to the polygon number. 

    Texture Orientation:
	Sometimes texture maps (notably ptex textures) have different orientations than might be normal in Houdini.  This parameter allows you to perform simple manipulations on the `s` and `t` coordinates.  The operations are:
	
        Default:
                Use the default `s` and `t` coordinates.
        Flip S:
                Flip the `s` coordinate (horizontal flip).
        Flip T:
                Flip the `t` coordinate (vertical flip).
        Swap S/T:
                Swap the `s` and `t` coordinates (diagonal flip).
	
	When performing any operations, the flipping occurs before the swapping.
