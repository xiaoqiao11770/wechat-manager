= Color Map =

"""Looks up a single sample of RGB or RGBA color from a disk image."""

This operator looks up a single sample of RGB or RGBA color from a disk
image. If the image does not have an alpha channel associated with it
(e.g. a JPEG image) and the operator returns RGBA, the alpha component
will be set to 1.

NOTE:
    This VOP uses point sampling and does not perform filtering of the texture.

@parameters
    Signature:
        RGB or RGBA values.
    Color Map:
        Image file used for look-up.
    U:
        Image u-coordinate.
    V:
        Image v-coordinate.
    Wrap:
        Determines how the image is evaluated when the texture
        coordinates are outside the range 0 to 1. The options are:

        Repeat:
            (string value `repeat`). The image map repeats outside the
            range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer component
            of the texture coordinate is ignored.
        Streak:
            (string value `streak`). Texture coordinates are clamped to
            the 0 to 1 range.
        Decal:
            (string value `decal`). Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1
            will evaluate to the border color rather than an image
            color.
    Border Color:
        Border color when Decal wrapping is used.
