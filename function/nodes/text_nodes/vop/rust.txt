= Rust Perforation =

"""Simulates a rusty, possibly perforated material."""

This operator simulates a rusty, possibly perforated material.

You will first generate a material that outputs a color, then pipe its
output into the Surface Color input of this operator.

The rust and perforation thresholds control the contribution of each
stage of corrosion, and represent good candidates for animation at the
shader level if tied to Parameter operators.

If the Surface Position (`P`) and Surface Color (`Cf`) inputs are not
connected, the global variables by the same name will be used instead.
Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for
`P`, and any operator that yields a lit color, such as [Shiny Metal|Node:vop/shinymetal] or
[Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting], as inputs for `Cf`. If you need to access the global
variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global]
operator.
