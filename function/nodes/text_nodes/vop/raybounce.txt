= Ray Bounce Level =

"""Returns the current ray-bounce level."""

This operator returns the current ray-bounce level.

For example, primary rays (i.e. rays sent from the camera) are level 0.
After a single reflection, the ray level is 1. After two reflections,
the level is 2, etc.

Note:  The pbrlighting function used in the default surface model may not
actually perform recursive ray-tracing, so the bounce level may not ever exceed
one.  Please look at the rayimport VOP.
