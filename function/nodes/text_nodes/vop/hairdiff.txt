= Hair Diffuse =

"""Generates a color specifically for curves (hairs) using a lambert lighting model calculation."""

This VOP uses the hair lambert lighting model 
calculation to generate a color for curves (hairs).
Typically, adding this lighting model into the network, is the last thing done 
before connecting the resulting color to the output `Cf` input.

NOTE:
    This is cannot be used with PBR.

@parameters

Diffuse Color:
    The diffuse color of the hair.

Diffuse Intensity:
    A multiplier which allows you to adjust the intensity of the diffuse color. 

@inputs

nN:
    This normal should be the explicitly connected to the specially calculated hair normal VOP. In this VOP the normal is already front facing and normalized. 

Kd:
    The diffuse intensity. A floating point value used to darken or lighten diffuse color. 

diff:
    The diffuse color. Usually with hair, a root and a tip color are specified. These 2 colors are mix along the length of the hair using the geometric or global _t_ coordinate.

@outputs

color:
    The diffuse lighting calculation.
    
    {{{
    Kd * diff * Cl * abs(dot(nN, nL))
    }}}

illum:
    Just hair diffuse lighting without the multiplication by the diffuse intensity and color. Usually used as an export parameter for extra image planes used in the composite of the final image.

bsdf:
    Returns the PBR `wirediffuse` function calculation.
    
    {{{
    Kd * diff * wirediffuse(normalize(dPdt))
    }}}
