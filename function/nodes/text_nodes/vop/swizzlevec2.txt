"""Rearranges components of a vector2."""

You can use the parameter interface or the node inputs to set the source vector and the new places for the source components.

@parameters

Source vector:
    The vector to rearrange.
    
Component 1:
    Which component of the source vector to use as the first component of the output vector.
    
Component 2:
    Which component of the source vector to use as the second component of the output vector.
    

@inputs

src:
        The vector to rearrange. 
        
integer inputs:
        Specify which component of the original vector to put in each place in the returned vector. So, for example, if `i0` is `2`, the third component of the original vector is copied to the zeroth component of the output vector.

@output

vec:
        The rearranged vector.
