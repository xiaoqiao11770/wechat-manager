"""Produces a surface displacement that simulates small surface damage
using anti-aliased noise of various frequencies."""

This operator produces a surface displacement that simulates small
surface damage using anti-aliased noise of various frequencies.

The Displacement Scale (`scale`) input determines the amount of overall
displacement of each frequency set. A positive scale will produce dents,
such as concrete holes and smallpox scars. A negative scale will
generate bumps, such as skin rash or stucco.

As an example, the following values will generate a pitted look. To
simulate pitted metal, for instance, pipe the Displaced Normal (`dispN`)
output into the `N` input of the [Shiny Metal|Node:vop/shinymetal] operator, and the resulting
metal color into the `Cf` input of the Output operator.

{{{
    freq       amp chip  scale 
        -------------+----+-----+-----
         0.5,0.5,0.5   1   0.01   0.2

}}}
Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both `disp` outputs piped into the matching inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output]
operator. Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which
case the displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the
`nN` input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to access
the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
