= Agent Rig Children =

"""Returns the child transforms of a transform in an agent primitive's rig."""

Returns a list of the direct children of the given transform.

Returns an empty array if the transform index is [out of range|Node:vop/agenttransformcount], the primitive number is out of range, or the primitive is not an agent.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Transform Index:
    Index of a transform in the agent's rig.
