= Make Space Transform =

"""Returns the transformation matrix to transform from a transform space such as an object's transform space to another space, such as world space."""

You can set the input values as parameters or override them by connecting nodes to the Make Space Transform VOP's inputs.

You can transform from/to the space of an object by entering the path to the object in the __From space__ or __To space__ parameters. Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser icon beside the parameter to choose the node from a tree. You can also choose one of the following spaces. 

* `space:world` - World space.
* `space:camera` - Camera space.
* `space:object` - Object space.
* `space:ndc` - NDC space.
* `space:current` - The current space of the vector.
* `space:light` - The space of the current light. Only available in light and shadow shaders.
* `space:lightndc` - NDC space of the current light. Only available in light and shadow shaders.

@parameters

From space:
    The path of an object, or space name, to transform from.
    
To space:
    The path of an object, or space name, to transform to.

@outputs

Transformation Space:
    The transformation matrix.
