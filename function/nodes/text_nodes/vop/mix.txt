= Mix =

"""Computes a blend (or a mix) of its input values using linear
interpolation."""

This operator computes a blend (or a mix) of its input values using
linear interpolation. If the bias specified is outside the range 0 to 1,
the values will be extrapolated linearly.

This operator performs the same function as the VEX `lerp()` call. For a
filtered, three-way blend, see Blend Regions.
