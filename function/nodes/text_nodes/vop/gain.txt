= Gain =

The Gain VOP is based on Perlin's section in Texture & Modeling, and is currently only used in some of the older materials.

Where `base` is the Input, and `amount` is the Gain, the basic process is to
take:

{{{
result = bias(2*base, amount)*.5;
}}}

when the base is greater than 0.5.  If the base is less than 0.5, the
computation is:

{{{
result = 1 - bias(2*(1-base), amount)*.5;
}}}
