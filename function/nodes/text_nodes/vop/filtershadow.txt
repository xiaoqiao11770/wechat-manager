"""Sends a ray from the position P along the direction specified by the
direction D, a..."""

This operator sends a ray from the position `P` along the direction
specified by the direction `D`, and returns the total amount of occlusion
of shaded surfaces between the point `P` and the point P+D.

The length of the `D` vector represents the farthest distance considered
when checking for occlusion. Each occluding surface is evaluated and its
opacity added to the total amount of occlusion.

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead. In the Shadow context, you will normally
connect the global `Ps` variable to the `P` input, and the global `L`
variable to the `dir` input.
