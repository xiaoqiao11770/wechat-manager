= Hue Shift =

"""Uses the shift value to move the hue of the input color along the color wheel by the amount influenced by the amplitude."""

This operator shifts the hue of the input color along the color wheel by the
amount of the shift value multiplied by the amplitude. 


@inputs

Shift Amplitude:
    This value is the magnifier of the shift amount. 
    It should be a float between 0 and 1.

Hue Shift Value:
    This is the amount to shift to the color. It is a float between 0 and 1,
    where the midpoint (i.e., 0.5) represents no shift. Values smaller than 0.5
    move the hue on the wheel counterclockwise, while values larger than 0.5
    move it clockwise. Values of 0 or 1 represent full rotation on the wheel,
    effectively leading to no hue shift.
    
    This value should be connected to a greyscale [texture|Node:vop/texture] map or a
    [noise|Node:vop/turbnoise] function if the shift is to vary across the surface and direction along the color wheel to shift the input color.

Shift Color:
    The color to be shifted.

@outputs

RGB Color:
    The new shifted color.
