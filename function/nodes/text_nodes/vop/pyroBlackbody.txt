"""Converts a temperature value into color (chroma) and intensity according 
to the blackbody radiation model."""

This node is designed to have most of its interface promoted up to the parent
material. to promote the UI for this node, you must choose 
__Promote Interface > UI + Links + Inputs__ to trigger scripts on the node 
to promote and create parameters up on the parent node.

@inputs

Field value:
    The input to the blackbody function. This is interpreted as a scale on 
    the node's __Temperature__ parameter/input. If you connect an input
    of a data type with multiple components (such as a vector), the node 
    will output the same data type with each component passed through the
    blackbody function separately.

@parameters

Active:
    If this checkbox is off, the node has no effect. This may be useful for
    debugging.

Temperature (K):
    #id: temp
    
    The temperature corresponding to an input value of `1`. For example, if
    this parameter is `5000` (the default), then an input value of `1`
    means a temperature of 5000 degrees Kelvin.

Tone mapping:
    #id: dotm
    
    The blackbody algorithm's output has a huge dynamic range. 

Adaptation:
    #id: tm_adapt
    
    Squashes or stretches the low end of the generated intensity, similar to 
    exposing a photograph for shadows.

Burn:
    #id: tm_burn
    
    Manipulates the high end of the generated intensity.
