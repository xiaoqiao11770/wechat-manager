"""Computes lighting using Physically Based Rendering."""

Also splits Shading Layers into the components required for surface shading. These are the surface color __Cf__ (only need in non-PBR modes), the opacity __Of__ and the BSDF __F__ (only need in PBR modes). This usually placed after any layer mixing with all the outputs plugged into an [Icon:VOP/output][Output Variables and Parameters|Node:vop/output] node.

When creating any VOP shader node, this node is automatically created and connected to the shader's layer output.

Depending on the rendering engine being used, this node takes on slightly different roles. See the table below for technical details. Note that no action is required when switching between engines though, as long as all outputs are connected to a [Icon:VOP/output][Output Variables and Parameters|Node:vop/output] Node.

In non-PBR modes:
    Compute lighting using the BSDF provided through the __F__ input or the __layer__ input's __F__ component. The result of this is the surface color output as __Cf__. The emission color __Ce__ is added to __Cf__.

In PBR Modes:
    Because the PBR engine computes lighting itself based on a BSDF, this node doesn't do any computation and the __Cf__ output remains unused. The __F__ input or the __layer__ input's __F__ component are simply passed through to the __F__ output without modification.

    __Ce__ is exported as a shader parameter and used as the emissive component by the PBR engine.


@inputs

layer:
    When connected, the layer's components are used to compute lighting.

    NOTE:
	If any of the input's below are also connected, they override the layer component of the same name.

F:
    The BSDF used to compute lighting.

    When __layer__ is also connected, this input overrides the layer's __F__ component.

Of:
    The opacity of the surface.

    When __layer__ is also connected, this input overrides the layer's __Of__ component.

Ce:
    The emission color of the surface.

    When __layer__ is also connected, this input overrides the layer's __Ce__ component.

@outputs

Cf:
    The computed surface color. Plug this into an [Icon:VOP/output][Output Variables and Parameters|Node:vop/output] Node's __Cf__ input.
Of:
    The opacity. Plug this into an [Icon:VOP/output][Output Variables and Parameters|Node:vop/output] Node's __Of__ input.

F:
    The BSDF. Plug this into an [Icon:VOP/output][Output Variables and Parameters|Node:vop/output] Node's __F__ input.
