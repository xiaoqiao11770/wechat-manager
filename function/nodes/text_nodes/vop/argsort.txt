"""Returns the indices of a sorted version of an array."""

Returns a list of indices that, if applied to the given array, will give a
sorted sequence in increasing order.  Performs a stable sort.

This lets sort your keys, but then apply those sorted indices to other arrays
without having to also reorder those arrays.

@inputs
    Array:
	Array to sort.

@outputs
    Sorted Indicies Array:
	A list of indicies in sorted order. Can be used as input to
	reorder node.
