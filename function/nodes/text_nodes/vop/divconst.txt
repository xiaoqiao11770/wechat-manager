= Divide Constant =

"""Divides the incoming integer, float, vector or vector4 value by the
specified constant value."""

This operator divides the incoming integer, float, vector or vector4
value by the specified constant value.

It represents a simpler version of the [Divide|Node:vop/divide] operator because it does
not require a second input. It is ideal for scaling a value by a
constant.
