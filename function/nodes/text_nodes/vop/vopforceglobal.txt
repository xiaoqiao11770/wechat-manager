= VOP Force Global =

"""Provides outputs that represent all the global variables for the
Force VOP network type."""

This operator provides outputs that represent all the global variables
for the force VOP network type. There are no inputs to this operator.

The [VOP Force DOP|Node:dop/vopforce] allows one to generate an arbitrary force using a
VOP network.  This operator provides access to the current object so
you can calculate the desired force.

== Inputs ==

    None.

== Outputs ==

    Outputs include:
    	P:
		Position to evaluate the force on.
	v:
		Current velocity at the position `P` on the object.
	w:
		Current angular velocity at the position `P` on the
		object.
	mass:
		The mass that the force will apply to.
	objid:
		The `$OBJID` of the object being processed.
