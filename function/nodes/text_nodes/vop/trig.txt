"""Performs a variety of trigonometric functions."""

This operator performs a variety of trigonometric functions. The
argument must be expressed in radians.

The frequency/offset make most sense for the `sin()`, `cos()`, and `tan()`
trigonometric functions. The frequency multiplies the input radians
while the offset is added to the result of the frequency scale.

For anti-aliased sine and cosine waves, see the Oscillations operator,
which is available in all shading contexts.

* `acos` computes the arc-cosine of the argument. The return value is in the range 0 to PI.

* `asin` computes the arc-sine of the argument. The return value is in the range -PI/2 to PI/2.

* `atan` computes the arc-tangent of the argument. The return value is in the range -PI/2 to PI/2.

* `cos` computes the cosine of the argument.

* `cosh` computes the hyperbolic cosine of the argument.

* `sin` computes the sine of the argument.

* `sinh` computes the hyperbolic sine of the argument.

* `tan` computes the trigonometric tangent of the argument.

* `tanh` computes the hyperbolic tangent of the argument.
