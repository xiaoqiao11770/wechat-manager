= Copy =

"""Takes a single input of any data type."""

This operator takes a single input of any data type. It simply creates a
copy of the input value, and sends it to the output. This provides a
safe means of swapping variable values within a subnet. For example,
suppose you have an If VOP that is supposed to swap the first and second
input values. If you were to simply connect the subnet input to the
subnet output, bad code would be generated. The first output would be
assigned the value of the second input, then the second output would be
assigned the value of the first input. But the first input value has
already been changed to the value of the second input, so the result
would be that both output values would equal the second input value.

To make this work properly, simply attach a [Copy VOP|Node:vop/copy] between the first
input and the second output. This fixes the problem because the second
output will be assigned the value of the copy of the first input,
instead of trying to assign it the value of the first input, which would
have already been changed.
