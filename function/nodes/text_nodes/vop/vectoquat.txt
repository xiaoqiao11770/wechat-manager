= Vector To Quaternion =

"""Takes an angle/axis vector and constructs the quaternion representing the rotation about that axis."""

The input is a rotation defined by a combined angle/axis.  The normalized version forms the axis to rotate around, and the length is how far to rotate, specified in radians.
