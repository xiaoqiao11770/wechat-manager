= Delayed Read Archive =

This procedural will load a RIB file at render time.

@parameters

== Main ==

RIB File:
    The RIB archive. 

== RIB Bounds ==

Bounding Box:
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will RenderMan load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding Box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case RenderMan will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.

SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
