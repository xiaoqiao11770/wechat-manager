= Make Instance Transform =

"""Builds a general 4x4 transform matrix derived from the
standard copy/instance attributes"""

This operator builds a general 4x4 transform matrix from a set of input parameters
that match the attributes and priorities used in [Copy and Instancing
operations |/copy/instanceattrs].  Those inputs that can take precedence over others
will also have a corresponding `use` input to signify their value should be used.

For example, create a [Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] bound to the `orient` attribute, plug its output into the `orient` input of this VOP, and plug its `bound_orient` output into the
`useorient` input.  The VOP will use the value from the `orient` parameter when it is
bound to an attribute on the geometry, but use lower precedence attributes like
`N` or `v` if no such attribute exists.
