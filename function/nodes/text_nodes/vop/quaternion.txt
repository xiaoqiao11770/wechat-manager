= Quaternion =

"""Takes an angle and an axis and constructs the quaternion representing the rotation about that axis."""

The input axis should be normalized.

TIP:
    To get rotate by a Quaternion:
    
    # Append `Angle` (in radians) and the normalized axis to the [Quaternion VOP|Node:vop/quaternion].
    
    # Append a [Quaternion Rotate VOP|Node:vop/qrotate].
    
    # Multiply the positional vector by the Matrix VOP to get the rotation.
