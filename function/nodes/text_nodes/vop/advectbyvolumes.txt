= Advect by Volumes =

"""Advects a position by a set of volume primitives stored in a disk file."""

Advects the provided position through the velocity field contained in the named
set of three volumes or vector VDB.  The __Single Step__ method takes only a single
step in the velocity field, but the various __Trace__ methods can take multiple steps
within a voxel to avoid violating the __CFL__ condition, according to the provided __Timestep__.

The higher order __Advection Methods__ are more accurate but take multiple velocity samples per step and are more expensive to evaluate. Higher __CFL__ values will result in fewer steps overall but more errors.
