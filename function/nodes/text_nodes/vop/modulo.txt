= Modulo =

"""Computes the modulo of two values."""

This operator computes the modulo of two values.

The sign of the modulus operation matches the behavior in Python. Using modulus to clamp a number to range will work as expected.  

`mod(-3, 5) == 2`

`mod(a, b)` is always in the range `[0, b)`, so if `b` is negative, the result is
also always negative.
