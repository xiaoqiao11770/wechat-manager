= Neighbor File =

"""Finds the nth neighbouring point for a given point in a given geometry file."""

This operator retrieves the index of the point which is the <<n>>th
connected neighbor of point `ptnum`. It returns -1 if `ptnum`,
`neighbournum`, or `input_index` is out of range. The result of this
operator can be fed into Import Attribute to retrieve more information
about the connected point.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Point Number:
    The point number in the geometry to find a neighbor of.

Neighbor Number:
    The nth connected neighbor whose point number is to be returned.
