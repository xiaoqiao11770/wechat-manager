= Point Cloud Export =

"""This node exports point data while inside a pcunshaded loop."""

The pcexport VOP exports point information while inside a
[Node:vop/pcunshaded] context.  The data produced by pcexport should
correspond to the current iteration point, and once data has been exported
for a given iteration point that point will never be processed again by a
pcunshaded loop.  pcexport should only be used with a pcunshaded loop -
otherwise its behavior will be undefined.  The channel name should match
the channel provided to the pcunshaded loop, and the channel should not
already exist in the point cloud file.  This node corresponds to the
[Vex:pcexport] VEX function.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for export.

channel:
    The channel to export.  You should select the data type for the channel
    using the __Signature__ parameter.

data:
    The data to insert into the export channel.

@outputs

success:
    Returns 1 when the export was successful.
