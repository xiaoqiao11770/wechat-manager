= Is Connected =

"""Outputs 1 if the input is ultimately connected, otherwise it outputs
0."""

This operator outputs 1 if the input is ultimately connected, otherwise
it outputs 0.

An input is not ultimately connected if it has no immediate link, or if
it has a link that comes directly from a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subnet] operator, and the
parent subnetwork has no corresponding input connection, or that
connection is also a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subnet] operator, and so on.

Thus, if an input is directly connected to a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subnet] operator, it
is not considered to be ultimately connected unless the parent network
provides an ultimately connected link to it.
