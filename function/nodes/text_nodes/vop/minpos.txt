= Minimum Position =

"""Finds closest position on a primitive in a given geometry file."""

This operator returns the closest position on a primitive in a geometry file to the given point.

@parameters

Input Geometry:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Position:
    The position to find the closest position to.

Max Search Distance:
    The maximum distance to look for a close primitive.  This can speed things up by allowing the search to quit early.

Closest Position:
    The closest position to the given search location.

    If none is found, the input position is returned.
