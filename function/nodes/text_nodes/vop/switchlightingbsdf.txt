= Switch Lighting BSDF =

#type: node
#context: vop
#internal: switchlightingbsdf

"""Use a different bsdf for direct or indirect lighting."""

This node makes it possible to use a different bsdf for direct and indirect
lighting.  For example, it is common to use blurry reflections of lights
(specular highlights) but sharp reflections of objects.  To do this, create
the blurry and sharp bsdfs, then combine them using this VOP into one bsdf
that will behave differently depending on whether lights or objects are
being reflected.

@inputs

direct:
    The bsdf to use for light reflections.

indirect:
    The bsdf to use for object reflections.

@outputs

f:
    The combined direct/indirect bsdf.
