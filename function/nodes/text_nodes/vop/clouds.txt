"""Simulates a cloudy sky using 4-dimensional anti-aliased noise, where
the fourth noise component is represented by time."""

This operator simulates a cloudy sky using 4-dimensional anti-aliased
noise, where the fourth noise component is represented by time.

If the Surface Position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable
by the same name will be used instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as `P` inputs. If you do need `P`, you will
find it in the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
