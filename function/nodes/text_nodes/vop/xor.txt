= Xor =

"""Performs a logical "xor" operation between its inputs."""

This operator performs a logical "xor" operation between its inputs.  Xor is short for Exclusive Or.  It returns true if either input is true, but false if both are true or neither is true.

The word "or" in English is often closest to "xor" as it implies you must pick
on, and only one, of the options.  For example, when asked if you want "Soup or
Salad?", "Both" is not an acceptable answer.

When applied to more than two inputs it becomes a count of the "parity" of the
number of true inputs.  If an even number of inputs is true, it returns 0.
If an odd number of inputs is true, it returns 1.

Being a logical operator, "true" means any number other than 0 and "false"
means zero.

@parameters
    Bitwise Operation:
	Instead of any non-zero value being treated the same, the input is
	broken into individual bits and the operation performed on them.

@inputs
    Input Number 1...N:
        The input values to be combined together.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.

@outputs
    Combined Value:
        The logical "and" combination of all inputs.
