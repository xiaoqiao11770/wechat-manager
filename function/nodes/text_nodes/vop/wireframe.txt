= Wireframe =

"""Implements a wireframe shader and outputs the final, lit color and
opacity."""

This operator implements a wireframe shader and outputs the final, lit
color and opacity.

It uses a Boxes operator to produce the basic wire pattern, then wipes
out the filling. Since it is implemented as a subnetwork, this operator
allows you to experiment easily with other pattern generators such as
Rings and Rounded Stars, different lighting models, and so on.

At its simplest level, with the color and opacity piped into the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output]
operator, this operator is a good visualizer of the surface texture
coordinates. However, it can easily evolve into a metal cage cage shader
with reflectivity, rust, and dents.

If the Surface Normal (`N`) or texture coordinate inputs (s and t) are not
connected, the global variables by the same names will be used instead.
You will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement
to the surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
