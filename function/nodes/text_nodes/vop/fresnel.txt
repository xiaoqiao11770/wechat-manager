= Fresnel =

"""Computes the Fresnel reflection/refraction contributions
given a normalized incident ray, a normalized surface normal, and an
index of refraction."""

The amount of reflected light will be returned in `kr`, and the amount of
transmitted light will be returned in `kt`. Optionally, the reflection and
transmission vectors can be returned in the `R` and `T` variables. Both `R`
and `T` will be normalized.

The global variables `I` and `N` will be used if the incident vector and
surface normal inputs are not connected. If connected, the `N` and `I`
vectors must be normalized.
