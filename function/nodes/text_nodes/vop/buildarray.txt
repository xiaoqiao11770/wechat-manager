= Build Array =

"""Outputs the array consisting of its inputs as array elements."""

This operator outputs the array build from its inputs.

The first input can be an integer, float, vector, vector4, matrix3, matrix, etc. The allowed data types of subsequent inputs depend on the data type of the first input. For example, if the first input is a float,
subsequent inputs should be floats, unless a conversion is allowed. For example, from an integer. The output data type is the array of the elements whose type is the same as the data type of the first input.

@inputs
Input Number 1...N:
    The input values to be added to the array.
Next Input:
    Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs can be specified.
    
@outputs
    Array:
        The array consisting of input values.
