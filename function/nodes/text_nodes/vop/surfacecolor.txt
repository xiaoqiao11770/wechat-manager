"""Generates a basic color with a choice of tinting with the point color and/or a color map."""

This VOP allows the user to choose between several different color combinations.
There are options to use the point color or point alpha attributes as well as a color map or
base color. With this VOP the UI is already correctly setup.

@parameters

useBaseColor:
    If this toggle is off, the `baseColor` is ignored.  Defaults to on.
    If `useBaseColor`, `usePointColor` and `useColorMap` are all off, the output color is white.

baseColor:
    This is the main output color for the material. Defaults to white.

usePointColor:
    If this toggle is on and a point color, (`Cd`), is defined,
    then that color is multiplied with the `baseColor`.  Defaults to on.
    If `useBaseColor`, `usePointColor` and `useColorMap` are all off, the output color is white.

useColorMap:
    If this toggle is on, the specified texture map is multiplied by the _baseColor_.
    Defaults to off. If `useBaseColor`, `usePointColor` and `useColorMap` are all off, the output color is white.

baseColorMap:
    This the name of the image file to be used as the color texture.  This parameter recognizes
    a map that has an alpha channel and will add the alpha values to the alpha output of the VOP.
    If no alpha channel exists in the map, then a default alpha of 1 is used.

colorMapWrap:
    #id: mapwrap

    Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
    are outside of the `[0,1]` range.

    Repeat:
        Repeat the texture (`tile`).
    Streak:
        Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
    Decal:
        Sets the color outside the texture map to the `Border Color`.

    See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

colorMapFilter:
    #id: mapfilter

    Type of anti-aliasing filter used.

    See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

colorMapWidth:
    #id: mapfilterwidth

    Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.

    See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

colorMapBorder:
    The color used outside the map if __Decal Wrap__ is selected.

    See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

usePointAlpha:
    If this toggle is on and a point alpha, (`Alpha`), is defined,
    then that alpha is multiplied with the alpha of the texture map (if one is used).  Defaults to on.
    If `usePointAlpha` and `useColorMap` are all off, the output alpha is white.

colorMapIntensity:
    This is a float parameter which can be used to scale the effect that the color map will have
    on the color output from this VOP.  A value of 0 will provide a similar result to not using
    a map at all.

@inputs

scoord:
        U coordinate (or global `s`).  If no input is connected, this will
        automatically read in the global s or u value.

tcoord:
        V coordinate (or global `t`).  If no input is connected, this will
        automatically read in the global `t` or `v` value.

@output

color:
    The resultant color from the Base Color, Color Map, and Point Color processing.

alpha:
    The resultant alpha from the Color Map and Point Alpha processing.
