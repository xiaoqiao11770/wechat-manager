"""Compute surface tangents in different ways."""

@parameters

Tangent Style:
    #id: tan_style
    
    Controls how this node calculates the direction of anisotropic
    reflections/highlights.
    
    Use Geometric Tangents:
        Use the geometric tangents (`dPds`, `dPdt`) automatically
        defined for the type of geometry being rendered. Since the
        geometry defines the tangents, the highlight is stable as the
        geometry moves and/or deforms. However, for polygonal
        geometry, this style of tangent calculation will have
        discontinuities / artifacts along edges.

    Intrinsic World Space:
        Calculate tangents in world space. Tangents will be smooth
        across all types of geometry, but the highlights will change
        if the object moves through space.

    Intrinsic Object Space:
        Calculate tangents in the shaded object's local space.
        Tangents will be smooth across all geometry, but the
        highlights will change if the object deforms.

    Compute From UV:
        Calculate tangents using UV attributes on the object. The U
        and V tangents will point in the directions of increasing U
        and V coordinates. As long as the UV coordinates are
        consistent and smooth, the highlight is stable as the geometry
        moves/transforms and smooth over polygonal surfaces.

    Use Connected `utan`, `vtan`:
        Use the tangent values from the connected `utan` and `vtan`
        inputs. This option allows you to use VOPs connected to the
        inputs to compute the tangents yourself for maximum
        flexibility.
