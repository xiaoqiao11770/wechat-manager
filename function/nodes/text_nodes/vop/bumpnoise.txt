"""Displaces surfaces along their normal using anti-aliased noise, and
returns the displaced surface position, normal, and displacement amount."""

This operator displaces surfaces along their normal using anti-aliased
noise, and returns the displaced surface position (`dispP`), normal
(`dispN`), and displacement amount (`amount`).

Optionally, the noise amplitude can be clamped to a specified range. The
clamping is done smoothly using a cubic interpolator. If a rolloff is
specified, the inflection point of the blend will be shifted. If the
rolloff is greater than 1, the shift will be to the right. If the
rolloff is less than 1 (and greater than 0), the shift will be to the
left.

For a denser noise, enable __Compute Absolute Noise Value__. The absolute
value is computed before any clamping takes place.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the Surface Position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable
by the same name will be used instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as `P` inputs. If you do need `P`, you will
find it in the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator. The input normal (`nN`) should
be normalized if explicitly connected. Usually, you will not need to
touch `nN` unless you want to apply an additional displacement using an
operator like [Bump Map|Node:vop/bumpmap].

Use this operator to generate a wide variety of patterns, from plateau
landscape and mountain ranges to crumpled paper, stucco and cork. For
example, a frequency of 7.2 with a height of 0.09 will yield a
stucco-like pattern if clamped between 0.05 and 0.43.
