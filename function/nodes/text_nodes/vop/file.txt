= Delayed Load Procedural =

This procedural will load geometry from an external disk file. Files loaded by the procedural can be shared amongst other instances of the procedural.

@parameters

File:
    The geometry file.

Material Archive:
    A file containing material definitions for the geometry.

Blur File:
    The file for deformation motion blur.

Shutter:
    Optionally, a shutter time can be specified when rendering motion blur.

Share Geometry: 
    This option will cause multiple procedurals which reference the same geometry file to share the geometry.  This means that less time is spent loading the geometry, but that the geometry is retained in memory for the duration of the render.  If memory is at a premium, you may get better performance by turning this option off.

NOTE:
    When the bounding box is not specified, the geometry will be loaded at declaration time, impacting memory.
