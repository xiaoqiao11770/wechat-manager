= Intersect 3D =

"""Intersects a 3D image along the line specified by two points."""

This operator intersects a 3D image along the line specified by two
points. The ray will intersect the [iso-surface|Node:sop/iso] of the texture at the
density specified. If an intersection is found, `hit` is 1 and `hitpos`
will contain the point position of the intersection.

Texture files will be searched for in the path specified by the
`HOUDINI_TEXTURE_PATH` environment variable.


@parameters
    3D Image:
        3D image file used for look-up.
    Channel:
        Channel to be integrated.
    Start Position:
        3D location in the image where to start integrating.
    End Position:
        3D location in the image where to stop integrating.
    Density:
        The density at which to intersect the iso-surface.
