= Relative to Point Bounding Box =

"""Returns the relative position of the point given with respect to the bounding box of the specified geometry."""

This operator returns the relative position of the point given with with
respect to the bounding box of the specified geometry. 

If no position is given, the global `P` variable will be used instead.
In some contexts this may be an error if no such variable has been bound.

If no file is given, the first input is used where applicable.

Because this uses point bounding boxes, the group is a point
group.  

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

File:
    The file on disk to find the relative bounding box location in.

Point Group:
    The subset of points to use for computing the bounding box.
    Uses SOP-style syntax, so an empty string means all points,
    and adhoc groups such as `0-10` and `@Cd.x>0` can be used.
