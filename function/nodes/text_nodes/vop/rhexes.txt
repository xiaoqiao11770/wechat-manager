= Rounded Hexes =

"""Generates repeating filtered rounded hexagons."""

This operator generates repeating filtered rounded hexagons. The output
is one if inside the ring or zero if outside, and can be used to mix
between colors or materials.

The hexness control can be used to make shapes from circles to
asterisks.

If the `s` and `t` inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (`s`,`t`) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.

The random seed output is only valid if using a single layer.
