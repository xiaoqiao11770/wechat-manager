= Subtract Constant =

"""Subtracts the specified constant value from the incoming integer, float,
vector or vector4 value."""

This operator subtracts the specified constant value from the incoming integer,
float, vector or vector4 value.

It represents a simpler version of the Subtract operator because it does not
require a second input. It is ideal as an decrement (`i--`) operation in a
While loop.
