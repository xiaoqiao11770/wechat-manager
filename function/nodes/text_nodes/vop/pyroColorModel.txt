"""Provides constant, artistic, and physically correct (blackbody) tint as
well as color correction functions."""

This node is designed to have most of its interface promoted up to the parent
material. to promote the UI for this node, you must choose 
__Promote Interface > UI + Links + Inputs__ to trigger scripts on the node 
to promote and create parameters up on the parent node.

@parameters

== Color model == (color_model)

Use point color (tint with Cd):
