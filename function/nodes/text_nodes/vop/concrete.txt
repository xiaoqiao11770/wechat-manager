"""Produces a surface displacement that simulates small surface
imperfections like tho..."""

This operator produces a surface displacement that simulates small
surface imperfections like those often seen in concrete walls.

The Displacement Scale (`scale`) input determines the amount of overall
displacement of each frequency set. A positive scale will produce dents,
such as concrete holes and smallpox scars. A negative scale will
generate bumps, such as skin rash.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the stone surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
