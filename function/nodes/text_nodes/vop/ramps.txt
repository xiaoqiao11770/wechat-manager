= Ramps =

"""Generates repeating filtered ramps."""

This operator generates repeating filtered ramps. The output is an
amount ranging between 0 and 1, representing the filtered area under the
ramp. The ramps are 0 at the left edge and 1 at the right edge.

If mirroring of ramps is turned on, the ramps will alternate in slope,
forming tent functions.

If the `s` input is not specified, a global variable appropriate to the
current context will be used instead, as follows: `s` in the shading
contexts; P.x in the geometry and particle contexts; and X in the
compositing context.
