= Layer Mix =

"""Outputs a mix of the two input layers, blended using the alpha value."""

@parameters

Alpha:
    #id: alpha
    The value used to mix layer A and B.

    At `0.0` only A is used. At `1.0` only B is used. A value in between `0.0` and `1.0` results in a mix of the two.

Surface Mode:
    #id: surfacemode
    Sets the operation applied to the layer's surface components F, Of and Ce.

    Mix:
	Mixes the two layers as described above.
    Use A:
	Outputs A's unmixed surface components.
    Use B:
	Outputs B's unmixed surface components.

Displacement Mode:
    #id: dispmode
    Sets the operation applied to the layer's displacement components P and N.

    Mix:
	Mixes the two layers as described above.
    Use A:
	Outputs A's unmixed displacement components.
    Use B:
	Outputs B's unmixed displacement components.
