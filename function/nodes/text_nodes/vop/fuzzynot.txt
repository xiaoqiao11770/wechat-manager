= Fuzzy Not =

"""This operator performs a fuzzy `not` operation on an integer or float value."""

This operator performs a fuzzy `not` operation on an integer or float value, returning 1 if the input is zero, and 0 if the input is non-zero. Otherwise a float between 0 and 1 is returned that indicates the fuzzy truth value of the operation.

Typically, `not` is used to build fuzzy logic networks for fuzzy inference.
