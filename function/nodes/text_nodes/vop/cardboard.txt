"""Simulates a rough, anti-aliased cardboard surface."""

This operator simulates a rough, anti-aliased cardboard surface.

If you are looking for a corrugated look, you can either use Furrows in
a separate displacement shader, or pipe the `dispN` output of the
[Furrows|Node:vop/furrows] operator into the Normal (`N`) input of this operator as a bump map. We recommend the former.

Other materials, such as ragged paper and rough walls can also be
simulated with this operator by changing the Surface Color (`scolor`)
input and possibly other parameters. Since all this operator does is a
noisy displacement followed by a call to the lighting model, it truly is
much more generic than its name suggests. For example, it was used to
simulate grout in the [Stone Wall|Node:vop/stonewall] operator.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the surface using an operator such as [Furrows|Node:vop/furrows]. If you need to access the
global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global]
operator.
