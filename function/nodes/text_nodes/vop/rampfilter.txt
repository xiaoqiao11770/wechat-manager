"""Adds anti-aliased analytical filtering to the output of a Ramp Parameter
VOP."""

This can be desirable for texture shading where a high-frequency lookup may 
give aliasing artifacts.

Connect the outputs of the Ramp Parameter to the Ramp Filter's inputs
this way:

Ramp Parameter output ||
    Ramp Filter input ||
Parameter |
    Lookup Position
Bases |
    Ramp Bases
Key Positions |
    Ramp Keys
Key Values |
    Ramp Values

@inputs

Filter width override:
    Controls the size of the anti-aliasing filter. In some contexts the node 
    can choose a proper width based on the available global variables. In 
    other contexts, such as SOPs, the width will default to `0`. If you 
    connect a node to the input, the input value will be used even if the 
    node can deduce a default width automatically.

Filter scale:
    The amount of anti-alias blurring to add to the output value.

@parameters

Signature:
    The datatypes of the position input and the ramped output.

Active:
    Whether to filter the output. When this checkbox is off, the inputs are
    passed through unchanged. This may be useful for debugging.

Space:
    #id: spacename

    The color/coordinate space in which the ramp operates.

Gamma:
    #id: gammaname
    
    The gamma to apply to the ramp _output_.

Range:
    #id: rangemin
    
    The range of values the ramp applies to. For example, when the range is
    `0` to `1`, the leftmost value on the ramp represents `0`, and the
    rightmost value on the ramp represents `1`. The node computes the
    results of inputs outside this range according to the "extend" parameters
    below.

Extend left/right:
    #id: lbt
    
    How to compute the result for inputs below/above the ramp's range.
    
    Hold:
        Returns the value at the nearest end of the ramp (for example, if the
        ramp's range is `0-1`, and the input is `-10`, it will return the
        ramp value for `0`).
    
    Cycle:
        Repeats the ramp continuously outside the range.

    Cycle-Accumulate:
        Like "Cycle", but starts each cycle relative to the end value 
        of the previous cycle.
        
        [Image:/images/nodes/vop/rampfilter_cycle_accumulate.png]
    
    Mirror:
        Cycles before/after the range are mirror images (reversed) of
        one another. The first cycle is not mirrored.
        
        [Image:/images/nodes/vop/rampfilter_mirror.png]
    
    Slope:
        Extends a line using the slope at the beginning/end of the ramp 
        range.
        
        [Image:/images/nodes/vop/rampfilter_slope.png]

Filter:
    #id: ftype
    
    The type of filtering to use. The default is "Point" meaning no
    filtering.

Scale:
    #id: fscale
    
    When __Filter__ is "Box" or "Gaussian", controls the scale of the filter
    effect.
