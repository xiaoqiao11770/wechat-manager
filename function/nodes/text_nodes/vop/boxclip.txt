= Box Clip =

"""Clips the line segment defined by `p1` and `p2` to the bounding box
specified by the min and max corner points."""

This operator clips the line segment defined by `p1` and `p2` to the
bounding box specified by the min and max corner points.

If the line is entirely clipped out, the result will be set to 0.
Otherwise, the values `p1` and `p2` will be clipped to the constraints
specified and the result will be 1.
