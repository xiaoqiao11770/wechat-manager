= Fuzzy And =

"""Performs a fuzzy "and" operation between its inputs and returns a value between 0 and 1."""

This operator performs a fuzzy "and" operation (Zadeh AND) between its inputs and outputs
a fuzzy value denoting the truth of the statement. Given boolean inputs, this computes the
logical [And|Node:vop/and] of the inputs.

Typically, fuzzy "and" is used to define rules (conditions) for fuzzy inference in a fuzzy logic 
network. All inputs and the output data type are floats (inputs are clamped to 0 to 1).

@inputs
    Input Number 1...N:
        The input values to be combined together.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.

@outputs
    Combined Value:
        The fuzzy "and" combination of all inputs.
