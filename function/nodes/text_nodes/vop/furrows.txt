"""Displaces the surface along the surface normal by an amount equal to
the value of an anti-aliased cosine wave."""

This operator displaces the surface along the surface normal by an
amount equal to the value of an anti-aliased cosine wave.

Use this operator to simulate wavy displacements such as soft water
waves, brow furrows and corrugated roofs.

To notice a displacement, you must connect a varying amount into the
Parametric Coordinate (`u`) input. Good candidates include the global `s`
and `t` variables, which are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global]
operator. For a more interesting result, use one of the outputs of the
[UV Noise|Node:vop/uvnoise] operator instead.

The Frequency (`freq`) input multiplies the parametric (`u`) value to
increase the number of oscillations. The Offset (`offset`) input is then
added to the result of the multiplication to produce a shift in the
waves.

The Blur (`blur`) input determines the filter width and controls the
softness of the waves. The blur should not be set too low, or aliasing
artifacts may occur.

For sharply connected furrows, enable the __Absolute Wave Value__ toggle.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

The input normal (`N`) should be normalized if explicitly connected. If
the surface normal is not specified, the global variable by the same
name will be used instead.

Normals are automatically recomputed and set for output.
