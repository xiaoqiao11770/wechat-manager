= Scales =

"""Generates a scale-like pattern and returns the displaced position,
normal, and displacement amount."""

This operator generates a scale-like pattern and returns the displaced
position, normal, and displacement amount.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the Output operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the `P`, `N`, `s` and `t` inputs are not specified, the global variables by
the same names will be used instead. If the normal (`N`) input is
provided, it should be normalized.
