= Find Attribute Value by Index =

Returns element index where an integer or string attribute has a certain value.

The element index is a point number, primitive number, etc, that can be used in
Get Attribute to fetch other properties of the element.  -1 is returned if no
elements have the search value.

Because more than one element may have the same value, the index parameter can
be used to determine which one to return.  If an index greater than the number
of elements is specified, -1 is returned.

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

@parameters

Signature:
    What type of attribute data to fetch. 

Geometry File:
    The file on disk to fetch an attribute from.

Attribute Class:
    Attributes can be stored on points, vertices, primitives, or even as global attributes (__Detail__). The class refers to where to look for it. It will adjust the meaning of __Point__ or __Primitive__ and __Vertex__.

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to fetch. `id` fetches the common id attribute, and `name` will fetch the name.

Search Value:
    The geometry will be searched for a point/vertex/primitive that matches this value.

Index:
    Which one of the elements that shares the same attribute value will be returned.
