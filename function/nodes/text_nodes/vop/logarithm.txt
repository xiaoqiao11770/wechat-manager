= Logarithm =

"""Computes the natural logarithm function of the argument."""

This operator computes the natural logarithm function of the argument.
The argument must be greater than zero.

This is the inverse of the [Exponential function|Node:vop/exp].

The default base is `e`, providing the exponential inverse.  Using
another base makes it the inverse of the [Power function|Node:vop/pow] for the respective
base.
