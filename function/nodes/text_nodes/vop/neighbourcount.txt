= Neighbor Count =

"""Calculates the number of points connected to the given point."""

This operator calculates the number of points connected to the given
point. It returns the number of such points, which can then be queried
individually using Neighbor and Import Attribute inside a For-Loop.

Possible reasons for failure include:

{{{
No input connected to the specified OP index.
        The point number is out of range for the given index.
    
}}}
