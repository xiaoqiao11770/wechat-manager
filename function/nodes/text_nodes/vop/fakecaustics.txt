= Fake Caustics =

"""Outputs and opacity value which can be used to approximate caustic lighting effects."""

@parameters

Transmission Tint:
    #id: transmit
    Controls how much the light passing through is tinted by the __Refract Color__ and __Attenuation Color__.

Shadow:
    #id: shadow
    At `1`, only the fraction of light transmitted through the surface (See __kt__ input) is used for caustics, At `0`, all light is allowed to pass.

    A value of `1`, which is more physically plausible, creates darker edges around object shadows. This occurs because when light hits an object at a grazing angle, less of the light is transmitted through the object and more of it is reflected.

@input
    The fraction of light transmitted (refracted) through the surface.
