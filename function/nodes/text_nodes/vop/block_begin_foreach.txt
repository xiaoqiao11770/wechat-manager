= Block Begin For-Each =

"""Marks the start of a for-each loop block."""

The Block Begin node is a for-each loop begin node.  It takes as inputs
an array to iterate over.  The second output is each element of that
array in turn, and the third output is the index of each element in
the array, starting with `0` and going to `len(array)-1`.

NOTE:
    The block nodes are usually implicitly put down with the higher
    level For Loop, For-Each Loop, While Loop tools.

@parameters
    Paired Block:
	A path to the paired block forming a begin/end block pair.
	Both nodes must be in the same network.  Nodes wired between
	the pair are enclosed in a convex hull and are placed inside
	a code block.  Depending on the types of the begin and end
	blocks, different control flow can be done on the block.

    Number of Outputs:
	By default an output is generated for each input.  This allows
	the specification of extra outputs.  If no input wire is present,
	the value is assumed to be `0` and the type must be specified.

	The outputs of an End block are paired with the outputs of the
	Begin block.  If no names are present, the pairing is done in
	order.  If names are present, they are paired by name.
