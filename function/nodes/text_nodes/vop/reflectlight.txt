= Reflected Light =

"""Computes the amount of reflected light which hits the surface."""

This operator computes the amount of reflected light which hits the
surface.

Multiply the output of this operator by a given reflection color to
obtain the actual reflected light.

The Bias (`bias`) input is typically a small number (i.e. 0.005) used to
help eliminate self-reflection.

The Max Contribution (`maxcontrib`) input is used to help the renderer get
an idea of how much the reflected light will contribute to the final
color of the pixel. This is typically the maximum of the reflection
component of a lighting model and has no effect on the resultant color.
Typically, values less than 1 should be given.

The ray origin and direction are typically computed using the [Refract|Node:vop/refract] or
[Fresnel|Node:vop/fresnel] operators.

If inputs `P` and I are not connected, the global variables by the same
names will be used instead, and a local copy of the global `I` variable
will be normalized inside this operator before the computation begins.
