= Neighbor =

"""Retrieves the index of the point which is the n-th connected
neighbor of point `ptnum`."""

This operator retrieves the index of the point which is the <<n>>th
connected neighbor of point `ptnum`. It returns -1 if `ptnum`,
`neighbournum`, or `input_index` is out of range. The result of this
operator can be fed into Import Attribute to retrieve more information
about the connected point.
