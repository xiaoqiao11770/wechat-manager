= Gingham Checks =

"""Generates anti-aliased gingham checks similar to a tablecloth
pattern."""

This operator generates anti-aliased gingham checks similar to a
tablecloth pattern. The result is a checker amount that can be piped,
for example, into a [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] operator to give the pattern some color.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, the global variables by the
same names will be used instead.
