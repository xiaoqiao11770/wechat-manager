= Fit Range =

"""Takes the value in the source range and shifts it to
the corresponding value in the destination range."""

This operator takes the value in the source range (srcmin, srcmax) and
shifts it to the corresponding value in the destination range (destmin,
destmax). For example, fit(.3, 0, 1, 10, 20) would return the value
13.

Values outside the input range will be clamped to the input range.
