"""Extracts one or more values from a struct by member name."""

See [VOP structs|/vex/vop_structs] for more information on using structs in VOPs.

# Wire a struct into the input.
# In the parameter editor, set the __Number of members__ you want to extract.
  For each item, set the __Member <<n>> name__ and the type you expect the
  member to be.
# The outputs contain the extracted values.

The node will error if the input struct does not have _all_ the specified
members or if they are not of the specified type.
