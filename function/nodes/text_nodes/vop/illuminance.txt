= Illuminance Loop =

"""Only available in Surface VOP networks."""

This operator is only available in Surface VOP networks. It contains
other VOP operators, and executes the code for the contained operators
once for every light that affects the surface being shaded.

This operator should only be used by advanced users with a good
understanding of shading and rendering. For most purposes, the Lighting
Model operator will provide all the functionality necessary to generate
convincing and realistic materials. Within the illuminance loop, the
Global Variables operator will change slightly. Two additional outputs
will be available: the Color of the current light (`Cl`) and the direction
from the point on the surface being shaded to the light (`L`). As is
always the case within an illuminance loop, the values of these global
variables are reset for each iteration through the code.

Any value that you wish to modify inside the illuminance loop must be
provided as an input. The outputs of the Illuminance Loop operator will
contain the modified versions of the inputs once the loop exits. The
actual values wired into the Illuminance Loop inputs are never modified,
and so can be connected to other operators in the network; but remember
that the values from these operators will always be the values
unmodified by the Illuminance Loop operator.

NOTE:
    Mantra uses the length of (`L`) to represent the distance to the light source. So if you normalize (`L`), the light is considered to be one unit away and only objects within this distance will cast shadows.

@inputs

All connected inputs mimic the properties of the output wired into
them. They adopt the same help label and name as the output
connected to them. If multiple outputs with the same name are
connected, the names of the inputs are automatically incremented to
make them unique.

Surface Position:
    The position of the point on the surface being shaded. If no
    input is connected, the default is the global `P`.

Surface Normal:
    The normal of the point on the surface being shaded. If no input
    is connected, the default is the global `N`.

Permitted Lighting Angle:
    The range of angle (in radians) away from the Surface Normal
    from which lights can influence the surface. Any light outside
    the cone defined by this value and the Surface normal is not
    part of the illuminance loop. If no input is connected, the
    default is PI/2 (i.e. 90 degrees in radians).

Light Type Mask:

    Specifies the types of lights that are allowed to influence the
    surface. This is a bit mask, where:

    {{{
    LIGHT_AMBIENT  = 0x01
    LIGHT_DIFFUSE  = 0x02
    LIGHT_SPECULAR = 0x04
    }}}
    
    If no input is connected, the default is LIGHT_DIFFUSE |
    LIGHT_SPECULAR.

Light Mask:

    Specifies a string listing names of light objects that can
    influence the surface. If no input is specified, the light mask
    specified in the parameters for the object being rendered is
    used.

Next Input:

    Any number of inputs can be connected here. Each time an input
    is connected, a new input slot is added.

@outputs

The list of outputs depends on the inputs connected to the [Subnet
Output|Node:vop/suboutput] operator contained in this operator. The data type and name
of each output will match the corresponding input of the [Subnet
Output|Node:vop/suboutput] operator.

@parameters

Surface Position:
    The position of the point on the surface being shaded. If no
    input is connected, the default is the global `P`.
    
Surface Normal:
    The normal of the point on the surface being shaded. If no input
    is connected, the default is the global `N`.
    
Permitted Lighting Angle:
    The range of angle (in radians) away from the Surface Normal
    from which lights can influence the surface. Any light outside
    the cone defined by this value and the Surface normal is not
    part of the illuminance loop. If no input is connected, the
    default is PI/2 (i.e. 90 degrees in radians).

Light Type Mask:
    Specifies the types of lights that are allowed to influence the
    surface. If no input is connected, the default is `LIGHT_DIFFUSE | LIGHT_SPECULAR`. This is a bit mask, where:


    LIGHT_AMBIENT:
        0x01
    LIGHT_DIFFUSE:
        0x02
    LIGHT_SPECULAR:
        0x04
    
Light Mask:
    Specifies a string listing names of light objects that can
    influence the surface. If no input is specified, the light mask
    specified in the parameters for the object being rendered is
    used.

Next Input:
    Up to 64 inputs can be connected here. Each time an input is
    connected, a new input slot is added.
