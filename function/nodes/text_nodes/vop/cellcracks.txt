"""Generates a cellular crack displacement suitable for simulating skin,
leather, dried earth, and all kinds of crusts."""

This operator generates a cellular crack displacement suitable for
simulating skin, leather, dried earth, and all kinds of crusts.

The underlying algorithm uses anti-aliased cellular noise to compute two
overlaying crack patterns of varying density (ie. frequency).

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, the global variables by the
same names will be used instead. Usually, you will not touch `N` unless
you want to pre-apply additional displacement to the surface using an
operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to access the global variables
directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
