= Color Mix =

"""Computes a blend (or a mix) of its two color inputs, and outputs the
resulting color."""

This operator computes a blend (or a mix) of its two color inputs, and
outputs the resulting color.

If the Bias parameter is not adjusted, or is just clamped to the unit
interval, the blending function is linear and the operator becomes a
special case of the [Mix|Node:vop/mix] operator, only catered to color data. The colors
will be extrapolated linearly if the bias is used "as is" and falls
outside the zero to one range.

A cubic function is used to interpolate the values if you choose the
"Ease In/Out" option, in which case this operator behaves very much like
the [Smooth|Node:vop/smooth] operator.

If you choose the "Cardinal Spline" option, the two colors are
interpolated non-linearly and the result is similar to using a [Spline|Node:vop/spline]
operator with its "u" input acting as the bias, and the primary and
secondary colors piped into the first/second and respectively
third/fourth "key" inputs.

The Color Blending Space menu allows you to blend RGB colors in HSV
space before converting the result back to RGB (if you choose the "HSV"
option). With the default "RGB" setting, incoming RGB and HSV colors
will be thrown into the mixer without any pre or post conversion.

This operator is meant mostly as a convenience tool for attaching color
to patterns and to other operators that output an "amount" in the zero
to one range. For example, you would pipe the output of the Rings
operator into the "bias" input of this operator and vary the two colors
for a look that suits your needs.
