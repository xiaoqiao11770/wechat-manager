= Shading Normal =

"""Computes the normal at the location specified by the P position."""

This operator computes the normal at the location specified by the `P`
position. The resulting normal is computed as the cross product of the
derivatives of `P`, and is adjusted so that interpolated normals are
relatively correct.

If `P`, `N`, or `Ng` are not connected, the global variables by the same names
will be used instead.
