= Mandelbrot Set =

"""Generates a Mandelbrot pattern."""

This operator generates a Mandelbrot pattern. The result is an amount
that can be piped, for example, into a [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] operator to give the
pattern some color.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (s,t) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.
