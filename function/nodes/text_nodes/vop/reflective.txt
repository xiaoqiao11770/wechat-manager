= Reflective =

"""Simulates a material with reflective properties and returns the
computed color."""

This operator simulates a material with reflective properties and
returns the computed color.

The reflection bias is used to help eliminate self-reflection, and is
typically a small number. The environment color is ignored unless you
specify a valid environment map.

If the `P`, `I`, or `N` inputs are not connected, the global variables by the
same names will be used instead. If connected, the incoming `I` and `N`
vectors must be normalized.
