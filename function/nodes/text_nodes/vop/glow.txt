"""Simulates a hot glow effect to be used in the Fog context, and
outputs color and alpha."""

This operator simulates a hot glow effect to be used in the Fog context,
and outputs color and alpha.

Unlike Halo, which produces a generic, white-light glow, this operator
is meant for glows around lights, flames, and other hot point sources.

The Core parameters control the white hotspot at the very center of the
glow. For a softer, less hot glow, set the Core Brightness (corebright)
value to 0.

The glow color is multiplied by the Opacity (`Of`) before being mixed with
the Surface Color (`Cf`), so you do not have to take opacity into account
yourself.

If the Surface Position (`P`), Position of Eye (`Eye`), Surface Color (`Cf`)
Surface Opacity (`Of`), and Surface Alpha (`Af`) inputs are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. If you need
to access the global variables directly, they are available from the
[Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.

For a simple glow, connect the color output (`color`) and the alpha output
(`alpha`) to the `Cf` and respectively `Af` inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output]
operator.
