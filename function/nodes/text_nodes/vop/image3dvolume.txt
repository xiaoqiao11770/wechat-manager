= Image 3D Volume Procedural =

"""This procedural will generate a volume from a 3D texture image (.i3d file)."""

Each channel within the texture will be bound to a corresponding vex shader parameter, if it exists. If the bounding box is not specified for the procedural, the bounding box of the texture map will be used.

@parameters

== Main ==

I3D File:
    Specifies the .i3d file to render.

== IFD Bounds ==

Bounding Box:
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding Box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.

SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
