= Tetrahedron Adjacent =

"""Returns vertex indices of each face of a tetrahedron."""

This operator allows you to determine which vertices of a tetrahedron form each of the four triangles of the tetrahedron.

Returns `-1` if an invalid number is specified.

Returns `0` to `3` to refer to the four vertices of a generic tetrahedron.

@parameters

Input Geometry:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Face Index:
    The face on the tetrahedron.  Face 0 is the triangle that doesn't have vertex 0.

Triangle Vertex:
    Which vertex on that face's triangle to retrieve, 0..2.
