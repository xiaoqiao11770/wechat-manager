= Add Attribute =

"""Adds a new attribute."""

This operator adds a new attribute.  The type of the attribute will be set 
from the value passed in.  The value will be used as the default value
for the attribute.

If the attribute already exists, it will attempt to be converted to the type.

NOTE:
	This does not change the attribute values.  To change the value of the currently processed element, see the [Bind Export VOP|Node:/vop/bind].  To change other elements or other attribute classes, see [Set Attribute VOP|Node:vop/setattrib].

NOTE:
        All geometry creation is done after all the elements have been processed. Therefore, you cannot read from geometry you just created.


Adding a value to the local variable will also update the `varmap`
attribute which is used by SOPs such as the [Point SOP|Node:sop/point] to determine mapping of attribute values to local variables available in the SOP.

@parameters

Signature:
    The type of attribute that this VOP will create. Choose between Vector (XYZ), Float (scalar), Vector4 (XYZW), Integer (scalar), Matrix3 (3x3 matrix), or Matrix (4x4 matrix). This also controls the type of the input __Default Value__.

Geometry Handle:
        Refers to what geometry to write to.  The default of 0 means the currently processed geometry.

Attribute Class:
        What type of attribute to create. 

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to create. The default `Cd` will create an attribute named `Cd`, otherwise known as __Diffuse Color__.

Local Variable Name:
    If specified, this will create a local variable (`$NAME`) on the SOP which can be used to evaluate the attribute in an expression.

Type Info:
    Refines the generic attribute to have more semantic meaning. This is a hint to some SOPs. For example, position vectors are translated, while Normal vectors are not.
