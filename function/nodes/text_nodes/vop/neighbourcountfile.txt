= Neighbor Count File =

"""Count the number of connected points from a given point in a given geometry file (or op:path)"""

This operator calculates the number of points connected to the given
point. It returns the number of such points, which can then be queried
individually using Neighbor and Import Attribute inside a For-Loop.

Possible reasons for failure include:

{{{
No input connected to the specified OP index.
        The point number is out of range for the given index.
    
}}}

@parameters

Geometry File:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Point Number:
    The point number in the geometry to find a neighbor of.
