= Rounded Stars =

"""Generates repeating filtered rounded five-pointed stars."""

This operator generates repeating filtered rounded five-pointed stars.
The output is one if inside the ring or zero if outside, and can be used
to mix between colors or materials.

The roundness control can be used to make shapes from circles to
pentagrams to stars.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (s,t) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.

The random seed output is only valid if using a single layer.
