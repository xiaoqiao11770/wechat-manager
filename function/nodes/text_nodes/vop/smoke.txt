"""Generates a material that simulates clouds, smoke, fire, and other
gaseous phenomena on small spheres."""

This operator generates a material that simulates clouds, smoke, fire,
and other gaseous phenomena on small spheres.

The Lighting Model defaults to constant which is best at simulating
light emitting gases. You have the option to use two other lighting
models, Lambert or Oren-Nayar, with the latter offering the ability to
flatten the light with increasing values of roughness (a nice effect,
but will increase rendering time).

Alpha Para (`apara`), Alpha Perp (`aperp`) and Alpha Roll (`aroll`) control
the rolloff of the smoke to the edges. See the [Alpha Mix|Node:vop/alphamix] operator for a
definition of these three controls. You will generally want to leave
Alpha Perp at zero. Alpha Para is the density control. Alpha Roll should
be a very small value (0.001 to 0.1), serving to concentrate the density
near the center of the spheres. If you start to see the silhouettes of
the spheres, decrease both Alpha Para and Alpha Roll.

Scale the Noise Frequency (`nfreq`) of the smoke to correspond to the
average size of your particle spheres. The default noise is scaled to
work well with spheres of radius 1. The Noise Amplitude (`namp`) scales
the peaks of the noise. For soft smooth smoke, set this value lower. For
fire and sharp effects, increase it. If too large (above 1.5), the
amplitude will generate edge effects in the smoke.

The Time (`time`) value is meant to have a parameter input that animates
the noise to create evolving smoke effects.

To make the noise `stick`, you need to wire a [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] operator
into the `P` input. When rest attributes exist in the geometry (highly
recommended), the noise will move with the geometry.

To inherit `Cd` and Alpha on geometry you have to wire in the correct
parameter and multiply it into the output color tab. The Parameter
operators should enable the __Use Input Value If Parameter Not Bound__
toggle to provide a fallback input.

If the Position (`P`) or the Normal (`N`) inputs are not connected, the
global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically, you
will leave `N` alone unless you want to add displacements to the surface
before the final color calculation (see [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]). If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the Global
Variables operator.

Render Tips:

* Render the smoke or clouds in a separate pass to optimize the
  rendering of elements.

* Set super sampling to 1x1 since noise is self-antialiasing.

* Turn off micropolygon rendering to obtain approximately 30% faster
  render times. This option will also change the look of the noise
  because micropolygons yield more billowy smoke.

* Turn off variance since it does little to increase render times.
