= Sample Sphere =

"""Samples the interior or surface of the unit circle, sphere, or hypersphere, within a max angle of a direction."""

The Sample Sphere VOP gives ways to sample either the interior or surface
of the unit circle (2D), sphere (3D), or hypersphere (4D), either uniformly,
optionally within some angle of a particular direction, or biased toward
that direction.  The sample is determined by 1, 2, 3, or 4 __Uniform Sample__
values, (depending on how many are needed to parameterize the sample space),
between 0 and 1.

In the __Orientation Quaternion (4D Direction)__ case, in order to make
generating orientation quaternions within a certain angle of the
specified orientation easier, the __Maximum Angle from Direction__
parameter is a quaternion rotation angle, instead of the Euclidean
angle in the 4D hypersphere, which would be half as large, and quite
confusing.

The __Bias Toward Direction__, if non-zero, is applied to the axial
__Uniform Sample__ component:

{{{
u = 1-pow(1-u, 1/(1+powerbias));
}}}

Where `u` is the axial component (the first component for 3D and 4D),
and `powerbias` is the bias.
