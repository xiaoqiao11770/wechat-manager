= Curl Noise 2D =

"""Creates divergence-free 2D noise using a curl function."""

This operator generates divergence-free 2D noise, computed using a curl 
function on standard Perlin Noise.  The operator can handle intervening 
geometry, allowing the noise field to "flow" around the given object.

The inputs of the Curl Noise operator have the same effect as their 
counterparts in the [Turbulent Noise|Node:vop/turbnoise] operator. The four
new inputs are __Step Size__ (`h`), __Surface Effect Radius__ (`d`), __Distance to Surface__ 
(`dist`), and __Surface Normal__ (`normal`).  

__Step Size__ controls the resolution of the curl function used to generate 
the noise.  A lower value will lead to tighter spirals in the noise.

__Surface Effect Radius__ determines the magnitude of the effect that intervening
geometry has on the created noise field.  A higher value causes greater 
disturbances resulting from intervening geometry.

__Distance to Surface__ is the signed distance value indicating the distance
from the current position to the closest surface of intervening geometry.  
Piping in the result of a signed distance field with respect to a piece of 
geometry will allow the generated noise to react appropriately to that 
surface geometry.
