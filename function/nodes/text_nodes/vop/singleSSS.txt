"""A simple implementation of single sub-surface scattering."""

@parameters
    
Surface Intensity:
    How much the sub-surface scattering should contribute to the resulting color.

Subsurface Color:
    The color of the sub-surface material.
    
Index of Refraction:
    The index of refraction of the material.

Evaluate RGB Separately:
    When this checkbox is turned on, each wavelength of light will be computed independently.

Pointcloud File:
    The SSS computation is quite expensive to compute. Both the multi and single scattering VOPs can use point clouds to both improve efficiency and to store intermediate results (caching). This is the name of the file containing the point cloud file.

Points to Filter:
    The number of neighboring points in the point cloud file to consider when computing the SSS.

Scattering Distance:
    The maximum distance from the shading point to be considered for contribution to the SSS color. This is used both by the point cloud filtering and by ray-tracing.

Scattering Phase:
    The scattering phase passed to the Henyey-Greenstein scattering function.

Number of Samples:
    The number of samples to use to evaluate the SSS. Increasing this will improve the quality but at greater computational cost.

Trace Bias:
    Ray-tracing bias.
