= Metaball Space =

"""Transforms the specified position into the local space of the
metaball."""

This operator transforms the specified position into the local space of
the metaball.

If the `P` input is not connected, the global variable by the same name
will be used instead.

The operator is valid only inside the Point Loop loop construct, and can
be used, for example, to compute the noise based on a "rest" position.
Below is the equivalent code in VEX:

{{{
forpoints(P)
        {
            vector npos = mspace(P) - mattrib("rest", P);
            nval += noise(npos);
        }
    
        where:
            forpoints - represents the Point Loop construct
            mspace    - represents Metaball Space
            mattrib   - represents Metaball Attribute
            noise     - represents non-periodic Perlin Noise
    
}}}
