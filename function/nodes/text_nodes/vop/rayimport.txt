= Import Ray Variable =

"""Imports the value of the specified variable sent from a trace() function and
stores it in `var`."""

This operator imports the value of the specified variable that was passed from
a trace() function shader and stores it in `var`. `found` is set to 1 if the
variable is found, otherwise it is set to 0.

If the variable being imported is not found, the value connected to the
`default` input is assigned to the output value. If no input is
connected to `default`, the value is initialized to 0.
