This VOP transforms scalar texture coordinates.

@parameters

Transform Order:
    The order in which transforms are applied. For example, scale first, then rotate, then translate. This can change the position and orientation of the object, in the same way that going a block and turning east takes you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

X/Y Offset:
    Translation along X and Y axes.

X/Y Scale:
     Non-uniform scaling about X and Y axes.

Rotation:
    Degrees rotation about XYZ axes.

X/Y Pivot:
    X and Y origin of the object.
