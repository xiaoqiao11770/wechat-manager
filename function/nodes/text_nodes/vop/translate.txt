= Translate =

"""Translates a 4x4 matrix 'amount' units along the x,y,z and possibly w
axes."""

This operator post-translates a 4x4 matrix 'amount' units along the x,y,z and
possibly w axes.

If the matrix has empty translates, ie, has just been promoted from a matrix3,
this fills in the translate component.
