= Ramp Parameter =

"""Represents a user-editable ramp parameter."""

The Ramp Parameter node represents a ramp user interface. The input
specifies an index into the ramp. The value of the ramp at that
position is the node's output.

See [the page on ramp parameters|/network/ramps] for more information
on working with ramps.

@parameters
    
Name:
    The name of the new parameter, both in the VEX function
    declaration, the definition of any OP type that uses the VOPNET,
    and the VOP tile's output. If a parameter by this name already
    exists, this operator will reference it and will disable most of
    of its own fields, such as the Parameter Type and Parameter
    Label.
    
    The name must not be a [reserved keyword|/vex/lang#reserved].

Prefix:
    The optional prefix to prepend to the parameter name.  The prefix changes
    the final name of the new parameter, both in the VEX function declaration,
    the definition of any OP type that uses the VOPNET, and the VOP tile's output.

Postfix:
    The optional postfix to append to the parameter name.  The postfix changes
    the final name of the new parameter, both in the VEX function declaration,
    the definition of any OP type that uses the VOPNET, and the VOP tile's output.
    
Label:
    A human-readable label for this parameter. Appears in the
    parent node's parameters and the tooltip when the user
    hovers over the output on the VOP tile.

Ramp Type:
    Whether this parameter is a color ramp (vector) or spline (float).

Color Type:
    The color space to use.  This only applies to color ramps.

Default Interpolation:
    The default method for interpolating between ramp keys, for
    example "Linear" or "Constant". The user can change the interpolation method
    in the ramp interface, but this sets the default.
    
Use This Node to Set Parameter Attributes:
    When several Parameter VOPs have the same __Parameter Name__, only
    one of the nodes is used to control the attributes of the
    parameter. Houdini decides which node to use for this by
    searching all the nodes according to the user defined order,
    then traversing inside subnets. If none of them have this
    parameter turned on, the first one found is used to set the
    parameter attributes. If one or more do have this option turned
    on, the first one with this option is used, even if another node
    (with this option turned off) is found first.

Show UI Controls By Default:
    Control whether to show the ramp controls by default on the owner node's
    parameter interface.

@inputs

Position:
    The index into the ramp. The Ramp Parameter node outputs the
    value of the ramp at this position.

@outputs

Parameter:
    The value of the ramp at the position specified by the
    input to this node.
