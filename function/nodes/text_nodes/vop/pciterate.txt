= Point Cloud Iterate =

"""This node advances to the next iteration point returned by pcopen."""

The pciterate VOP will either start a point iteration or advance to the
next iteration point.  The pciterate VOP should normally be used as input
to a while loop condition, with [Node:vop/pcimport] operations inside the
loop to gather iteration point information.  The pciterate VOP corresponds
to the [Vex:pciterate] VEX function.

You should usually iterate through all points in the point cloud.  If you
don't iterate over all points, it is necessary to use the [Node:vop/pcclose] VOP to close the point cloud before other operations are performed in the shader.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for iteration.

@outputs

success:
    Returns 1 when the iteration was successful, in which case point data
    can be queried using pcimport.
