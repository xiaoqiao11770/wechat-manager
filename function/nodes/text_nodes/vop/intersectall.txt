= Intersect All =

"""Computes all the intersections of a ray with geometry."""

This operator computes the all intersections of the specified ray with the
geometry.

The uv values are the intrinsic interpolation coordinates for the underlying geometric primitive. For a triangle, they represent the barycentric coordinates of the triangle. For other primitives they may represent other values, such as parametric coordinates. They are not tied to any attribute values.

In order to use these values, you would need to interpolate an attribute for a primitive at the given coordinate. Please see the [Vex:prim_attribute] function, which takes these coordinates for evaluation.

TIP:
    Intersect will only check for intersections within the maximum length
    of the __Ray Direction__ - `[0, length(raydir)]`.
