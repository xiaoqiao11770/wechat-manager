= Agent Layer Bindings =

"""Returns the transform that each shape in an agent's layer is bound to."""

Returns an empty array if the layer name is not one of the agent's [layers|Node:vop/agentlayers], the primitive number is out of range, or the primitive is not an agent.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Layer:
    The name of one of the agent's layers.

Shape Type:
    Specifies whether to use all shapes in the specified layer, or only the static / deforming shapes.
