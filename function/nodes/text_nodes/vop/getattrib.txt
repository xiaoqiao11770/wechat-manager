= Get Attribute =

Get Attribute can fetch the attribute value from a geometry stored on disk.

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

@parameters

Signature:
    What type of attribute data to fetch. The attribute should be large enough to fill out the desired size. For example, a vector attribute needs to be a float attribute of size 3. Therefore to fetch color, you'd use __Vector Attribute__.

Input:
    You can fetch attributes from one of the inputs to the current
    operator rather than a file.  When set to other than __File__, the __Geometry
    File__ is overridden.  This allows you to refer to a SOP operator without
    the `op:` or `opinput:` syntax.

Geometry File:
    The file on disk to fetch an attribute from.

Attribute Class:
    Attributes can be stored on points, vertices, primitives, or even as global attributes (__Detail__). The class refers to where to look for it. It will adjust the meaning of __Point__ or __Primitive__ and __Vertex__.

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to fetch. `Cd` fetches the common color attribute, and `P` will fetch point position.

Point or Primitive:
    When the class is point, this will be the point number to fetch the attribute from. If the class is primitive, it is the primitive number. If it is vertex, again it will be primitive. Detail attributes ignore this as there is only one.

Vertex:
    When the attribute mode is vertex this specifies which vertex on the given primitive should be the source of the attribute. 

Default Value:
    If the attribute can't be found, or is an invalid type to be
    read as the current type, this default value will be used instead.
