= Wire Pattern =

"""Returns float between 0 and 1 which defines a wire grid pattern useful for simulating screens or visualizing parametric or texture coordinates."""

Typically, this operator is used in a displacement shader with the output used as the displacement amount. This value can be made an export parameter for import into the surface shader to control the opacity and/or color.

@inputs

width:
    The width of the wires.

UFreq:
    The number of wires along the _s_ direction.

VFreq:
    The number of wires along the _t_ direction.

s:
    U coordinate. This should be connected to the _s_ output of
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, 
    the global _s_ will be used instead.

t:
    V coordinate. This should be connected to the _t_ output of the 
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, the global _t_ 
    will be used instead.

@outputs

sum:
    This is a float between 0 and 1.
