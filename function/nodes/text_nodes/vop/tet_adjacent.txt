= Tetrahedron Adjacent =

"""Returns primitive number of an adjacent tetrahedron."""

This operator retrieves the index of the tetrahedron adjacent to the given face of an existing tetrahedron.

Return `-1` if the primitive is not a tetrahedron or doesn't have an adjacent tetrahedron.

`Tetrahedron Face Index` can be used to get the vertex indices of each face
of a tetrahedron.

@parameters

Input Geometry:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Tetrahedron:
    The primitive number.  

Face Index:
    The face on the tetrahedron.  Face 0 is the triangle that doesn't have vertex 0.
