"""Inserts an item, array, or string into an array or string."""

Inserts the given value or array into the destination string or array at the
provided insertion point index.

If the index is negative, it measures from the end of the string.  If, after
this, it is still negative, it is clamped to 0 (ie, prepend).

with arrays, inserting past the end will grow the array up to the insertion
point by filling with zero or `""`.

With strings, inserting past the end will nominally fill with invalid
characters, ie `""`, and thus in practice append to the original string.

@inputs
    Array:
	The array to insert value into.
    Index:
	The insertion point index.
    Value:
	The value, string, or array to insert.

@outputs
    New Array:
	The new array resulting from the insertion operation.
