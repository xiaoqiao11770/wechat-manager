"""Provides color correction functions."""

This node is designed to have most of its interface promoted up to the parent
material. to promote the UI for this node, you must choose 
__Promote Interface > UI + Links + Inputs__ to trigger scripts on the node 
to promote and create parameters up on the parent node.

The parameters let you enable and control various standard color correction
functions such as hue rotation, bias, gain, brightness, tint, and so on.

This node is similar to the standard
[Color Correct VOP|Node:vop/colorcorrection] but deals with certain things such
as large input ranges differently to accommodate the needs of the Pyro
material.

@parameters

Active:
    #id: cc_active
    
    When this checkbox is off, the node has no effect. This may be useful
    for debugging.

Gamut mapping:
    #id: cc_gamut
    
    How to map "illegal" colors outside the color gamut.
    
    None:
        No mapping. Don't try to make the colors "legal", simply output
        the results of the correction functions.
    
    Clamp:
        Clamp all values to 0-1. This will make all colors legal but throws
        away much of the information about the color (for example
        hue, saturation).
    
    Absolute colorimetry:
        Moves the color to the nearest representable color in the color 
        space.
    
    Relative colorimetry:
        Like "Absolute colorimetry", but instead of moving the color to the
        nearest representable color (shortest distance), moves to the nearest
        color _along the line from the current color to the white point_.

The remaining parameters implement various standard color correction 
functions.
