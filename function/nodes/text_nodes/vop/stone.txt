"""Simulates a rough, non-descript stone material."""

This operator simulates a rough, non-descript stone material.

The stone displacement consists of noisy bumps and cavities, whose
randomness is controlled by Bump Frequency (`bfreq`), Bump Amplitude
(`bamp`) and Bump Roughness (`brough`). The amount of cavity chipping is
determined by the Chip Amount (`chip`) input. By increasing the `chip`
amount, you can make the stone look more porous. Additional displacement
can be passed in through the Bump Amount (`bump`) input. For an example of
how `bump` is used, see the [Stone Wall|Node:vop/stonewall] operator.

The "Pepper" inputs refer to the additional color noise that is
"peppered" over the stone surface to make it look more realistic. The
look of the pepper noise is controlled by three inputs: Pepper Amplitude
(`pamp`), Pepper Roughness (`prough`), and Bump Frequency (`bfreq`). The
Pepper Color (`peppercolor`) specifies its color.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the stone surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to
access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
