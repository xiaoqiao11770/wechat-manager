"""Transforms texture coordinates by the inverse of the matrix
consisting of the translation, rotation, and scale amounts."""

This operator transforms texture coordinates by the inverse of the
matrix consisting of the translation, rotation, and scale amounts.

If input `uvw` is not connected, the global variables `s` and `t` are used
instead: uvw = {s, t, 0}.
