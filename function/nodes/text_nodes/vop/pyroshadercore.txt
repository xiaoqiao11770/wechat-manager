= Pyro Core Shader =

"""Provides the core functionality needed to build a high-quality volumetric shader."""

This node is the foundation on which the [Pyro Shader|/nodes/shop/pyro] is built. Use this core shader if you need more flexibility than is available with the SHOP node or if you intend to use [shader layering|/shade/layering].

TIP:
    Create a [Pyro Shader|/nodes/shop/pyro] at the SHOP level and take a look into it's VOP network to see how the this node can be used to build a full-featured, production-ready shader.

@parameters

Scattering Phase:
    #id: phase
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/pyro#shade_phase

Smoke Brightness:
    #id: ksmoke
    Controls the overall smoke brightness. This is multiplied with the __Smoke Color__.

Smoke Color:
    #id: smokecolor
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/pyro#s_color

Emit Brightness:
    #id: kemit
    Scales the emission intensity coming from the __emit__ input.

Emit Color:
    #id: emitcolor
    The color of the emissive component.

Shadow Density:
    #id: kshadow
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/pyro#s_shadowint

Shadow Color:
    #id: shadowcolor
    The color of shadows cast by density the volume.

@inputs

density:
    The smoke density, usually coming from a volume.

emit:
    The emission intensity, usually coming from a volume.
