= Layer Composite =

"""Combines two layers using standard compositing operations."""

By default, the layeralpha component of each layer is used for the operation. When Aa is connected, it's value is used instead of layer A's alpha value. When Ba is connected, it's value is used instead of layer B's alpha value.

@parameters

Operation:
    #id: op
    The compositing operation used.

    A over B:
	Composites A over B.
    A inside B:
	Restricts A to the area of Bâ€™s alpha component.
    A outside B:
	Restricts A to the area outside of B's alpha component.
    A atop B:
	Composites A over B, but only where the B's alpha exists.
    A xor B:
	Makes the two layers mutually exclusive. If their alpha components overlap, the overlap is removed.

@inputs
A:
    Layer A

Aa:
    Layer A's alpha value. If this is not connected, the layer's intrinsic layeralpha component is used.

B:
    Layer B

Ba:
    Layer B's alpha value. If this is not connected, the layer's intrinsic layeralpha component is used.
