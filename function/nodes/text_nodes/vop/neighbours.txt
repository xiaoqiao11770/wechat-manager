= Neighbors =

"""Retrieves an array of indices to the points connected to the given point."""

This operator returns an array of all the points connected to the given
point on the specified geometry.  Connections are by edges.

The resulting array can be sent to a [For-Each VOP|Node:vop/block_open_foreach] to operate on each neighbor.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Point Number:
    The point number in the geometry to find neighbors of.
