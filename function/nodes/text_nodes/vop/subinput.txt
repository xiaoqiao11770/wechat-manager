= Subnet Input =

"""Allows the connection of operators outside a subnet to operators
inside the subnet."""

This operator allows the connection of operators outside a subnet to
operators inside the subnet. This operator can only be created inside a
subnet type operator such as: [If|Node:vop/if], [Illuminance|Node:vop/illuminance], [Subnet|Node:vop/subnet], and [While|Node:vop/while].

For every input connected to a subnet type operator, this operator will
have an output that corresponds to that output. Connecting the output of
this operator to another operator inside the subnet is the same as
connecting the operator outside the subnet to the operator inside the
subnet. Disconnecting an input from the subnet will delete the
corresponding output from this operator. Thus care must be taken when
removing inputs from the subnet to check that the connections from this
operator are still correct.

@outputs

    The list of outputs depends on the inputs connected to the subnet
    containing this operator. The data type of each output will match
    the data type of the corresponding input. The name will be the same,
    except it will be prefixed with an underscore "_".
