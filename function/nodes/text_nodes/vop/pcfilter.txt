= Point Cloud Filter =

"""This node filters the points queried by pcopen."""

This node filters points queried by pcopen to produce an averaged result.
The pcfilter VOP invokes the underlying [Vex:pcfilter] VEX function.

`pcfilter` takes the points that were opened by the point cloud and produces a filtered value. The following equation shows how the individual points are weighted.

`w_i = 1-smooth(0, maxd*1.1, d_i);`

`maxd` is the farthest point, and `w_i` is the weight for a given point at distance (`d_i`). Points that are closer to the center will be weighted higher with that formula, rather than it being an average.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for filtering.

channel:
    The channel name to be filtered.

@outputs

value:
    The filtered value.  The pcfilter VOP will filter using a smooth
    falloff with distance from the lookup point.
