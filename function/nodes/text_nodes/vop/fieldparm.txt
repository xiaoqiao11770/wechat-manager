"""Provides a "fallback" value for a field/attribute if the field does not 
exist or the given field name is an empty string."""

This node may be useful for building low-level assets. For a more useful
higher-level version, see the [Pyro Field VOP|Node:vop/pyroField].

@parameters

== VOP Parameters ==

Field Name:
    #contentfrom: fieldname#name

Field Type:
    #id: intype

    The required type of the incoming field.

Promote:
    #id: promote
    
    Convert the incoming value from the field to a different data type.
    See the data type you want to convert to with the __Output type__
    parameter.

Output Type:
    #id: outtype
    
    The data type output by this node.

Method:
    #id: method
    
    How to fill in the extra components when converting to a data type
    with more components than the incoming type, for example converting
    a vector to a vector4. Or, what value to use when converting from 
    
    The following options are available when converting "up".
    
    Repeat last comp:
        Repeats the last component of the input. For example, converting a
        float `4.0` to a vector would give `4.0, 4.0, 4.0`
    
    Pad with 0s:
        Fills extra components with `0`s. For example, converting a
        float `4.0` to a vector would give `4.0, 0.0, 0.0`
    
    Pad with 0s:
        Fills extra components with `1`s. For example, converting a
        float `4.0` to a vector would give `4.0, 1.0, 1.0`
    
    Pad with constant:
        Fills extra components with the value of the __Padding constant__
        parameter.
    
    The following options are available when converting from a vector to a
    float.
    
    Component <<n>>:
        Use the value of the given component of the vector.
    
    Min/Max/Average/Sum/Length:
        Use the given function to combine the components of the vector into
        a single value.
    
    The following options are available when converting from a vector4 to a
    vector.
    
    Truncate:
        Drop the last component of the vector4 to create a vector.
    
    Dehomogonize:
        Divide the first three components by the fourth (W) component.

Padding Constant:
    #id: padval
    
    When __Method__ is "Pad with constant", the constant value to use to
    fill in the extra components.
