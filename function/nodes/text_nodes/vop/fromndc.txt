= From NDC =

"""Transforms a position from normal device coordinates to the
coordinates in the appropriate space."""

This operator transforms a position from normal device coordinates to
the coordinates in the space of the camera/light.

@parameters
Position In NDC Space:
    This is the position of a point in NDC space which is to be transformed into the context space.  In SOPs/POPs, the resulting point will be in geometry space (i.e. SOP space).  You do not normally have to transform the resulting position after using this VOP.

@outputs
	The position of the point in camera space.
