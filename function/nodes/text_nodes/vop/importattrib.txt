= Import Attribute =

"""Imports attribute data from the OP connected to the given input."""

This operator imports attribute data from the OP connected to the given
input. It returns 1 if successful and 0 if unsuccessful. Possible reasons
for failure are:

* No input is connected to the specified index.

* The attribute does not exist on the input geometry.

* The attribute size/type doesn't match the VEX type.

* The input geometry has fewer points than the VEX OP's geometry.

* The point number given is larger than the number of points in the
  input.

Specifying the point number is optional.

When using Import Attributes inside POPs, care is required. If one reads
from an attribute that is being written to, undefined results can occur.
In this case, one should turn on __Cache Incoming Geometry__ at the POP
level.
