"""Provides outputs representing commonly used input variables of fur guide
shader network."""

This operator provides outputs that represent all the global variables
for fur guide shader network. There are no inputs to this operator.

Most of the parameters provided refer to a hair or the skin from which the
hair is grown.

@parameters

== Inputs ==

    None.

== Outputs ==

    Point Position:
	Position of each vertex in the generated hair.

    Width:
	Width of the rendered curves.

    Hair Distance:
	Position of the current vertex as a fraction of the hair's length.

    Is Parameter Bound:
	True if clump hairs were provided to the shader.

    Clump Root:
	Position on the skin from which the clump hair is grown.

    Clump Point Position:
	Position on the current vertex of the clump hair.

    Hair ID:
	Unique ID for each generated curve.

    Hair Root:
	Position on the skin from which each hair is grown.

    Fur Density:
	Amount of hairs per unit area.

    Normal:
	Interpolated normal direction from skin.

    UVs:
	UV texture coordinates.

    Output Matrix:
	Transformation deforming the local skin neighbourhood from its rest
	position.

    Using Guides:
	True if guide hairs were used to produce the initial shape of the
	current hair.
