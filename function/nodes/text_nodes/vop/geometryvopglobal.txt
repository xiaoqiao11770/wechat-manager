"""Provides outputs that represent all the global variables for the
Attribute VOP network types."""

This operator provides outputs that represent all the global variables
for the Attribute VOP network types. There are no inputs
to this operator.

The Attribute VOP operators, such as [Geometry VOP DOP|Node:dop/geometryvop] and the [Attrib VOP SOP|Node:sop/attribvop], can process all the attributes of one class on a geometry.

NOTE:
    Volume VOP Global Variables do not work in cvex shaders.

== Inputs ==

    None.

== Outputs ==

    Outputs include:
    	P:
		Position of current element.
	Velocity:
		The `v` attribute of the current element.
	Force:
		The `force` attribute of the current element.
	Life:
		The `life` attribute of the current element.
		This is NOT compatible with the life attribute in the VOP SOP.
	Age:
		The `age` attribute of the current element.
		This is NOT compatible with the age attribute in the VOP SOP.
	Id:
		The `id` attribute of the current element.
	Cd:
		The `Cd` attribute of the current element, often
		used to store the diffuse color.
	N:
		Value of the `N` attribute of the current element.
		Unlike the VOP SOP, this will not be automatically
		computed if it doesn't exist on the input.
	Time:
		The global time at which the volume is being
		evaluated.
	Timeinc:
		The timestep currently being used for simulation or
		playback.
	Frame:
		The current frame being processed, note this can be
		fractional.
	
	Point Number:
		The current point number attached to the currently processed element.  If this is a primitive, it is the first point on the primitive.  If it is a detail, it is the first point in the geometry.
	Primitive Number:
		The current primitive number attached to the currently processed element.  If this is a point, it is the primitive that owns the first vertex that refers to the point (if any).  If it is a vertex, it is the primitive that owns the vertex.  If a detail, the first primtiive.
	Vertex Number:
		The linear number of the currently processed vertex.  This is not the index of the vertex inside a primitive's vertex list!  It is instead an index of the vertex in the list of all vertices in the geometry.  Note it can be much higher than Number of Vertices.
	Number of Points:
		The total number of points in the geometry.
	Number of Prims:
		The total number of primitives in the geometry.
	Number of Vertices:
		The number of vertices in the primitive that is currently being processed.  (Or the primitive that first owns the element, if the current element is not a primitive)
