= Gradient 3D =

"""Returns the gradient of a single channel 3D texture image at a
specified position within that image."""

This operator returns the gradient of a single channel 3D texture image
at a specified position within that image.

If the position is outside of the bounding box of the image, the value
returned will be 0. If the channel specified contains more values than
the return type (i.e. a vector channel when a float return type is
desired), the gradient of the first component of the vector will be
returned. If the channel specified contains fewer values than the return
type, the missing components will be filled with the last valid
channel.

Texture files will be searched for in the path specified by the
`HOUDINI_TEXTURE_PATH` environment variable.
