= Class Cast =

"""Downcasts a generic (anonymous) co-shader object to a specific co-shader"""

== Overview ==

The Class Cast node allows specifying a concrete co-shader class for the generic co-shader handles passed to the shader. This allows some other VOPs to access information about the concrete class. For example, a [Method Call VOP|Node:vop/methodcall] can query the co-shader for the available methods that can be invoked on the co-shader object.

The list of available types appearing in the parameter menu contains all types available currently in the Houdini session.

@parameters
    Co-Shader Type:
	The type name of a co-shader class to cast to.

@inputs
    Co-Shader:
	The co-shader object whose type needs explicit conversion cast.

@outputs
    Co-Shader:
	The converted co-shader object. The wires connected to this output will carry extra information about the co-shader type the input has been cast to. This information is used by other VOPs, such as [Method Call|Node:vop/methodcall], but does not have bearing on the generated code otherwise.
