"""Generates a non-repeating rainbow color ramp by modulating the hue
over the range of the parametric coordinate `s` and using the
given saturation and value to compute the HSV color."""

This operator generates a non-repeating rainbow color ramp by modulating
the hue over the range of the parametric coordinate `s` and using the
given saturation and value to compute the HSV color. The HSV color is
then converted to RGB.

If the s input is not specified, a global variable appropriate to the
current context will be used instead, as follows: `s` in the shading
contexts; P.x in the geometry and particle contexts; and X in the
compositing context.
