= Plane Clip =

"""Clips the line segment defined by p1 and p2 against the 3D plane
defined by the following equation: plane."""

This operator clips the line segment defined by p1 and p2 against the 3D
plane defined by the following equation:

{{{
plane.x*x + plane.y*y + plane.z*z + plane.w
}}}
If the line is entirely clipped out, the result will be set to 0.
Otherwise, the values p1 and p2 will be clipped to the constraints
specified and the result will be 1.
