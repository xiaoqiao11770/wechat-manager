This operator generates an anti-aliased mosaic pattern using an image
file as a source for coloring the tiles, and cellular noise as a
generator of randomly shaped tiles.

Set the cell jitter to 1 for square tiles. Increase the cell frequency
for larger tiles.

If the Position (`P`), Normal (`N`) and texture coordinate (`s` `t`) inputs are
not connected, the global variables by the same names will be used
instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as
inputs for `P`, and Shading Layer Parameter as the input for `s` and
`t`. You will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional
displacement to the surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you
need to access the global variables directly, they are available from
the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
