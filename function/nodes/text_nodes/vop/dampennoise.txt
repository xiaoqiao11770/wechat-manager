= Dampened Noise =

The Dampened Noise VOP is an alternative to [Anti-Aliased Noise|Node:vop/aanoise].

@parameters

Signature:
    Input and Noise values.

1D/3D/4D Position:
    The position in noise space to evaluate noise.

1D/3D/4D Frequency:
    The frequency of noise space. Basically how quickly noise changes.

1D/3D/4D Offset:
    The offset into noise space (added to the position).

Amplitude:
    A scale factor on the resulting noise.

Roughness:
    Determines the coarseness of the noise.

Max Octaves:
    Limits the noise to a fixed number of iterations.
