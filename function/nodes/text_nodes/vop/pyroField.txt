= Pyro Field =

#type: node
#context: vop
#internal: pyroField

This node may be used to create a user interface on a material for
editing the values coming from a field or attribute.

It is designed as a higher-level "meta-parameter" similar to the
[Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] for values to be taken from a field or 
attribute. However, Houdini does not treat this node specially as it does the
Parameter node, so to promote the UI for this node, you must choose
__Promote Interface > UI + Links + Inputs__ to trigger scripts on the 
node to promote and create parameters up on the parent node.

@parameters

Field name:
    #contentfrom: fieldname#name

[Include:fieldparm#intype]

Promote to type:
    Convert the incoming value from the field to a different data type.
    See the data type you want to convert to with the __Output type__
    parameter.

[Include:fieldparm#method]

Fit to Range (unclamped):
    #id: dofit
    
    Does a straight remapping of values in the field to target values without
    clamping the result.

Use lookup ramp:
    Remaps the values in the field according to a float or color ramp.

Contour:
    #id: contour
    
    Increases or decreases contrast for values at the _bottom_ of the 
    input range. This is sometimes useful to control feathering in volume
    fields.

Soft Clip:
    #id: softclip
    
    Increases or decreases contrast for values at the _top_ of the 
    input range. This is sometimes useful to control feathering in volume
    fields.

Clamp to Min:
    #id: lowlimit
    
    Clamp outgoing values to this minimum.

Clamp to Max:
    #id: highlimit
    
    Clamp outgoing values to this maximum.

Final amplitude:
    #id: amp
    
    Scale the output of the above operations by this value.

Filter:
    #id: ftype
    
    The type of filtering to do on the output. "Point" is no filtering.

Scale:
    #id: fscale
    
    The scale of the filter effect, when __Filter__ is "Box" or "Gaussian".
