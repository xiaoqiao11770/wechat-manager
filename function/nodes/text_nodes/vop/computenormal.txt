"""This node gives finer control over handling of the normal attribute in VOPs."""

Typically, when VOPs cook geometry, the SOPs will try to do the right thing with the `normal` attribute.  That is, if the `P` attribute is modified, the `normal` attribute will usually be out of date.  The right thing is usually to re-compute the point normals whenever `P` changes (provided the VEX code doesn't modify `N` on its own).

However, in some cases, you may want finer control over how the `normal` attribute is handled.  There are three possible choices provided:

# No modification to N:
    The VEX code will leave the `N` attribute unchanged.
    
# Re-compute N if P changes (default):
    The VEX code will recompute the `N` attribute, if the `P` attribute is
    changed.
    
# Forcibly recompute N:
    The VEX code will recompute normals, regardless of whether `P` is modified.
