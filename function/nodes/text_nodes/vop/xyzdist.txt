= XYZ Distance =

"""Finds closest position on a primitive in a given geometry file."""

This operator finds the distance to the closest primitive on the given geometry file.

@parameters

Input Geometry:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read live SOP geometry.

Primitive Group:
    Primitives to restrict the distance computation to.  This can be
    any primitive pattern, including @ adhoc primitives.

    Empty patterns will match all primitives, as in SOPs.

Position:
    The position to find the closest position to.

Max Search Distance:
    The maximum distance to look for a close primitive.  This can speed things up by allowing the search to quit early.

Distance:
    Distance to the closest primitive.

Primitive:
    Index of the closest primitive.

    -1 if no closest primitive was found.

Primitive UV:
    Parameteric position on the closest primitive.  The [Primitive Attribute VOP|primattrib] can be used to recover the value at this location.
