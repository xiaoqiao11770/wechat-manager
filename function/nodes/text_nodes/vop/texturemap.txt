= Texture Map =

The Texture Map VOP is a wrapper around the [Color Map VEX function|Node:vop/colormap].

@parameters
Signature:
    RGB or RGBA values.

Color Map:
    Image file used for look-up.

U:
    Image u-coordinate.

V:
    Image v-coordinate.

Wrap:
    Determines how the image is evaluated when the texture
    coordinates are outside the range 0 to 1. The options are:

    Repeat:
        (string value `repeat`). The image map repeats outside the
        range 0 the range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer component
        of the texture coordinate is ignored.
    Streak:
        (string value `streak`). Texture coordinates are clamped to
        the 0 to 1 range.
    Decal:
        (string value `decal`). Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1
        will evaluate to the border color rather than an image
        color.

Border Color:
    Border color when Decal wrapping is used.

Filter:
    Specifies the type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation. Choose between: Point (no filter), Box, Gaussian, B-Spline, Catmull-Rom, and Mitchell.

Filter Width:
    A float representing the filter width in both x and y directions. The filter width is used for analytic texture filtering across micropolygons when using micropolygon rendering. Typically you should use a width of 1.
