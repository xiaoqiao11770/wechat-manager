"""Computes either a Catmull-Rom (`Cardinal`) spline or a Linear spline
between the specified key points, given an interpolant (`u`)
in the domain of the spline."""

This operator computes either a Catmull-Rom (`Cardinal`) spline or a
Linear spline between the specified key points, given an interpolant (`u`)
in the domain of the spline. The result is a 1D, 3D, or 4D value
representing u's image on the spline.

The Cardinal keys are uniformly spaced over the range 0 to 1. Because of
the nature of the Cardinal spline, the value associated with the first
and last keys will never be returned. However, these keys are used to
determine the shape of the curve on entry and exit. If you want the
spline to reach its end points, connect the first key and last key
twice. See the Fire operator for one such example.

If you are blending only two vector types using the Cardinal
interpolant, the [Color Mix|Node:vop/colormix] operator offers the convenience of fewer
connections. Make sure, however, that you choose the __Smooth With
Cardinal Spline__ option to obtain the exact same results as with this
operator.

The Linear spline interpolation is equivalent to a sequence of Linear
Interpolation operators. Consider the simpler [Mix|Node:vop/mix] operator if only two
inputs are required.
