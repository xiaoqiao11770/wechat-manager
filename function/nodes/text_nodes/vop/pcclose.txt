= Point Cloud Close =

"""This node closes a point cloud handle opened by pcopen."""

This node closes a point cloud handle opened by pcopen, so that the handle
is no longer usable by other point cloud VOPs.  It is often not necessary
to explicitly introduce a pcclose VOP; however, if you iterate over a
partial set of points you may need to use the pcclose VOP to avoid warnings
during shader execution.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be closed.
