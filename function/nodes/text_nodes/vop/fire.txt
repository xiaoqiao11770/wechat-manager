"""Generates 2D fire by modulating the t parametric direction using 3D
anti-aliased noise."""

This operator generates 2D fire by modulating the t parametric direction
using 3D anti-aliased noise.

If the Surface Position (`P`) input or the T Coordinate (`t`) input is not
connected, the global variable by the same name will be used instead.
Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as `P` inputs,
and Shading Layer Parameter or UV Project as `t` inputs. If you do need
just `P` or `t`, you will find them in the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
