= Rest Position =

"""Checks if the geometry attribute "rest" is bound and, if so, uses it
as the rest position for shading."""

If no such binding exists, it converts the incoming position (`P`) to the
specified space.

The following space conversions are available:

{{{
Texture                       (string value "texture")
Object                        (string value "object")
Normalized Device Coordinate  (string value "ndc")
World (Unchanged)             (string value "world")
}}}
The __Texture__ option takes a position in world space and converts it to
shader space. The __Object__ option takes a position in world space and
converts it to object space. The __NDC__ option takes a position in world
space and puts it in the normalized device coordinate space (screen
space). The __World__ option leaves the incoming data untouched.

The output of this operator is typically connected to a modifier such as
[UV Transform|Node:vop/uvxform] or [Anti-Aliased Noise|Node:vop/aanoise].

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead.
