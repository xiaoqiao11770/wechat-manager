"""Returns a list of closest points from a file"""

These functions open a geometry file and return a list of points with the location <<P>> within <<radius>>, based on point positions found in <<Pchannel>>.  Only the <<maxpoints>> closest points within the given radius will be returned. The file name may use the `op:` syntax to reference SOP geometry in the OP contexts.  The <<Pchannel>> parameter indicates the attribute which contains the positions to be searched.

The `ptgroup` is a point group that limits the points to search.  This is a SOP-style group pattern, so can be something like `0-10` or `@Cd.x>0.5`.  A blank string is treated as matching all points.
