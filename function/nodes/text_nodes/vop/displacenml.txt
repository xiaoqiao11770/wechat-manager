= Displace Along Normal =

"""Displaces the surface along the surface normal by a given amount."""

This operator displaces the surface along the surface normal by a given
amount. The displacement is anti-aliased.

You will often pipe the output of a pattern operator such as Stripes,
Boxes, or Rings into the "amount" input. You can further control the
amount of displacement by the "scale" multiplier.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

The input normal (`nN`) should be normalized if explicitly connected. If
the position (`P`) and normal (`nN`) inputs are not connected, the global
variables by the same names will be used instead.

Normals are automatically recomputed and set for output.

Note that in the SOP/POP contexts, the shears and object space
deformation are not implemented. They exist as parameters for
completeness only.

TIP:
    When doing a displacement in RenderMan, be sure to add an
    [RSL Transform|Node:vop/rsl_transform] node to P before piping it
    into your noise VOP. Make this "current to world" and change the
    displace space at object level to be the camera you are rendering
    through. Otherwise the noise will slide.
    
@parameters

Displacement Amount:
        Overall displacement amount, including the amount for shears.
         
Scale:
        A multiplier of the amount in the perpendicular direction.
