= Soft Dots =

"""Generates repeating soft dots."""

This operator generates repeating soft dots. The output is between zero
and one, with 1 at the center of the dots and zero at the outside. It
can be used to mix between colors or materials.

If the s and t inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (`s`,`t`) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.

The random seed output is only valid if using a single layer.
