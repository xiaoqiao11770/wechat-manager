= Refracted Light =

"""Sends a ray starting at origin P and in the direction specified by
the normalized vector I."""

This operator sends a ray starting at origin `P` and in the direction
specified by the normalized vector `I`. The resulting color, opacity and
alpha will be returned.

The __Bias__ parameter is typically a small number used to prevent
self-refraction. The __Max Contribution__ parameter is used to give the
renderer an idea of how much the refracted light will contribute to the
final pixel color, but has no effect on the results of this operator.

The ray origin and direction are typically computed using the [Refract|Node:vop/refract] or
[Fresnel|Node:vop/fresnel] operators.

In order to prevent the renderer from computing standard transparency
(i.e. non-refracted transparency), the Of variable must be set to 1,1,1
to make the surface opaque. The `Af` variable can be set to any value.

If inputs `P` and `I` are not connected, the global variables by the same
names will be used instead, and a local copy of the global `I` variable
will be normalized inside this operator before the computation begins.
