= Point Loop =

"""Only available in Image3D VOP networks."""

This operator is only available in Image3D VOP networks. It contains
other VOP operators, and executes the code for the contained operators
once for each metaball or particle that contains the position passed
in.

If the distance is specified, all metaballs and particles within the
distance of the point specified will be iterated through. The distance
parameter is optional and may result in slower execution of the shader.

Inside the point loop, the Metaball Density and Metaball Attribute
operators may be used to query the contribution of the current point
instead of getting a blended value. The Metaball Space operator can be
used to transform the points into the local space of the metaball.

Any value that you wish to modify inside the point loop must be provided
as an input. The outputs of the Point Loop operator will contain the
modified versions of the inputs once the loop exits. The actual values
wired into the Point Loop inputs are never modified, and so can be
connected to other operators in the network; but remember that the
values from these operators will always be the values unmodified by the
Point Loop operator.

Here is a pseudocode example of how to compute the point color of the
metaball which contributes the maximum weight to the point in space:

{{{
float  crt_distance = 0;
float  max_distance = 0;
vector max_color;
}}}
{{{
for_all_points( P )
{
    crt_distance = metaball density of P;
    if (crt_distance > max_distance)
    {
        max_color = metaball attribute "Cd" of P;
        max_distance = crt_distance;
    }
}
vector blended_color = max_distance * max_color;
}}}


@inputs
    All connected inputs mimic the properties of the output wired into
    them. They adopt the same help label and name as the output
    connected to them. If multiple outputs with the same name are
    connected, the names of the inputs are automatically incremented to
    make them unique.

    Position:
        Vector representing the position of a point in space. If no no
        input is connected, the default is the global `P`.
    Distance:
        If specified, all metaballs particles within the distance of the
        point specified will be iterated through.
    Next Input:
        Up to 64 inputs can be connected here. Each time an input is
        connected, a new input slot is added.

@outputs

    The list of outputs depends on the inputs connected to the [Subnet Output|Node:vop/suboutput] operator contained in this operator. The data type and name
    of each output will match the corresponding input of the [Subnet Output|Node:vop/suboutput] operator.
