= Splatter =

"""Generates a splatter pattern and returns the splatter amount."""

This operator generates a splatter pattern and returns the splatter
amount.

The primary frequency controls the size and number of all splats. The
secondary frequency and the number of iterations determine the size and
number of small splats.

If the position (`P`) input is not specified, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead. Typically, `P` is the output of the [Rest
Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] operator.
