"""Provides outputs that represent all the global variables for the
Volume VOP network type."""

This operator provides outputs that represent all the global variables
for the volume VOP network type. There are no inputs to this operator.

The Volume VOP operators, such as [Gas Field Vex DOP|Node:dop/gasfieldvop] and the [Volume VOP SOP|Node:sop/volumevop], can process multiple volumes simultaneously.  Volumes are bound
to specific parameters and all bound volumes are available when
processing one volume.

Most of the parameters provided refer to the specific volume currently
being processed.  The exception is __Density__, which is provided for
convenience for simple networks.

NOTE:
    Volume VOP Global Variables do not work in cvex shaders.

== Inputs ==

    None.

== Outputs ==

    Outputs include:
    	P:
		Position of current voxel.
	density:
		Value of the `density` field at this voxel location.
	ix, iy, iz:
		Voxel indices.  For Volumes these ranging from 0..resolution-1.
		For VDBs, they refer to the absolute location.  Use
		volumepostoindex with the orig to get the lowest value of
		the ix,iy,iz for the current VDB.
	resx, resy, resz:
		Resolution of the current volume.
	center:
		The center of the current volume.
	orig:
		The bottom left corner of the current volume.
	size:
		The size of the current volume.
	dPdx, dPdy, dPdz:
		These vectors store the change in `P` that occurs for
		each step in the x, y, and z voxel indices.
	BB:
		Position inside the bounding box of the volume.
		Each coordinate ranges from 0..1.
	Time:
		The global time at which the volume is being
		evaluated.
	Timeinc:
		The timestep currently being used for simulation or
		playback.
	Frame:
		The current frame being processed, note this can be
		fractional.

	First to Fourth Inputs:
		These provide a path to the inputs of the Volume VOP SOP.  They
		can be wired to any VOP that takes a file path for geometry to
		have the node instead use one of the inputs of the SOP.
