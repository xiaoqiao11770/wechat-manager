"""Returns a pixel value in one of the 4 input COPs connected to the VEX
COP."""

This operator returns a pixel value in one of the 4 input COPs connected
to the VEX COP. The pixel may be in any plane, at any position, at any
time. Use __No Filtering__ if you aren't querying a pixel at a different
location than the current pixel, since it is the quickest input method.
Use __Bilinear Filtering__ for doing subpixel queries. Use __Full
Filtering__ when warping or transforming the input pixels, or when
maximum filtering is required (it is the slowest but best quality
filtering method).

The plane_index, array_index, u, v, and frame inputs all default to the
value of global variables if they are not connected. The default values
are as follows:

{{{
       plane_index     = PI
               array_index     = AI
               u               = IX or X as appropriate for the
signature
               v               = IY or Y as appropriate for the
signature
               frame           = F
        
}}}
