"""Simulates an anti-aliased stucco material, with its typical bumpy
surface and light color."""

This operator simulates an anti-aliased stucco material, with its
typical bumpy surface and light color.

The Displacement Scale (`scale`) input determines the amount of overall
displacement of the frequency. A negative scale will turn stucco into a
dented material, somewhat akin to concrete.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg]
 as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to access
the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
