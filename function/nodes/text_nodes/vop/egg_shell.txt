"""Returns a new surface normal (`N`) which has a slight fine grained bump on it."""

This operator returns a new normalized and front faced normal generated by adding noise based on the input point and added to the input normal. This is just normal perturbation, not a displacement.

@inputs

    pos:
        The position the noise is based on.  If this input is not connected, the global `P` is used instead and the _Object Space_ toggle should be on. Typically the [Node:vop/restpos] or [Node:vop/uvspacechg] are used as inputs for the position.
    
    norm:
        The Surface Normal the bump affects. Typically this is not connected and the global `N` is used, unless additional displacement is desired.
    
    freq:
        The frequency of the noise. Higher number result is a finer grain.
    
    scale:
        This is the height of the bump. Since this is just a normal perturbation, not a displacement, this should be a small number.
    
    space:
        This toggle defaults to off. It should be set to on, when the position is not connected or the input point is not in _Object Space_. This keeps the noise attached to the object.


@outputs

NF:
    This is the new normal, which is normalized and faced front.
