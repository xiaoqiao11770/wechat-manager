= Conductor Fresnel =

"""Outputs a physically correct reflection factor for conductive materials."""

This operator supports two different ways of defining relevant material properties:

* __Physical Parameters__ mode, which uses the physical __Refractive Index__ (eta) and __Extinction Coefficient__ (kappa). This can be used with exact, measured material values to match the reflection response of real-world materials.
* When __Physical Parameters__ if disabled, the more intuitive parameters __Reflectivity__ and __Edge Tint__ are used. Any physically plausible __eta__ and __kappa__ values can also be represented this way. It is possible to create physically implausible settings.

@parameters

Physical Parameters:
    #id: physparms
    When enabled, use physical parameters rather than intuitive color parameters.

Reflectivity:
    #id: reflectivity
    Controls the reflectivity of the surface when facing the camera.

Edge Tint:
    #id: edgetint
    When the surface is seen from a grazing angle, the color transitions to this value. This tinting is typical of conductive materials.

Refractive Index:
    #id: eta
    The refractive index of the conductive material.

Extinction Coefficient:
    #id: kappa
    The extinction coefficient of the conductive material.

@inputs

nI:
    Incident ray direction.

nN:
    Surface normal.
