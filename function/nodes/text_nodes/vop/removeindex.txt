"""Removes an item at the given index from an array."""

A negative index value will count from the end of the array, 
so a value of -1 will remove the last value, -2 the penultimate,
and so forth.

@inputs
    Array:
	The array to remove value from.
    Index:
	The index to remove the value from.
    Default Value:
	If the index was not in the array this value is used for the
	removed value.

@outputs
    Result Array:
	The resulting array after the value at index is removed or the
	input array if the index is not valid.
    Removed Value:
	The value that was removed from the array or default value if
	the index was not valid for the input array.
