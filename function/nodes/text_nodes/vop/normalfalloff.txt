= Normal Falloff =

"""Generates a falloff value based on the relationship between the normal and incident vectors."""

This VOP uses the dot product of a surface normal and an incident vector to calculate
the falloff value for curved surfaces. The return value will be one (1) where the
normal and incident vector line up (parallel), and zero (0) where they are at
right angles (perpendicular). This does not work on flat surfaces, 
since there is no variance in the relationship between the normal and incident 
vectors with flat surfaces. This VOP can be used to create glow effects,
simply by multiplying it with a glow color and applying it to a sphere;
or to soften edges by multiplying with the opacity.
If inverted, it can be used to create an inexpensive _Fresnel_ effect by 
multiplying it with the output color of an environment map; 

@inputs

nN:
    The normal vector used in the calculation of the falloff.
	The normal should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input, 
	and front-face calculation is optional but recommended. 
	If this input is not connected, the global variable N will be used instead.

nI:
    This is the incidence direction ray used in the calculation of the falloff.
	The incident vector should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input. 
	If it is not connected, the global variable will be used instead.

exp:
    A floating point value used as the exponent in a power function 
	to tighten or relax the falloff rate. Values less than or equal to
	zero (0) are not recommended.

invert:
    This toggle will invert the result. This is useful for creating glows.

facefwd:
    This toggle will force the normal to face the camera.
	It is recommended this toggle be on.

@outputs

float:
    This is the amount of falloff.
