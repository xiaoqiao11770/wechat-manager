"""Simulates shiny wood grain."""

This operator simulates shiny wood grain.

The Vein Frequency (`vfreq`) input controls the number of veins in the
pattern. For veins that fade out gradually, vary the Vein Attenuation
(`vatten`) input.

The Vein Scale (`vscale`) input offers a good means of controlling the
ellipse ratio of the veins. Thus, tree stumps, which have rings of a
fairly circular nature, should use a `vscale` value close to one.
Longitudinal cross-sections, on the other hand, are very elliptical and
should use a `vscale` value greater or less than one.

The Groove Depth (`gdepth`) input allows you to displace the surface along
the vein area. A groove depth of zero will not generate any
displacements at all. Alternatively, you can use the Vein Amount output
in a separate displacement shader.

This operator uses the Ripples pattern as the vein generator. Other
techniques include using the Veins operator with a cylindrical
projection and one-sided vein softness.

If the Position (`P`), Normal (`N`) and texture coordinate (s t) inputs are
not connected, the global variables by the same names will be used
instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as
inputs for `P`, and Shading Layer Parameter as the input for `s` and
`t`. You will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional
displacement to the wood surface using an operator such as [Bump Map|Node:vop/bumpmap]. If you need to access the global variables directly, they are
available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
