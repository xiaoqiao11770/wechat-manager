= Pixel Area =

"""Returns the area of the current pixel after being transformed to the
new UV coordinate `uvpos`."""

This VOP is available in the compositing node definition contexts
([VEX Compositing Generator|Node:vex/cop2gen]
and [VEX Compositing Filter networks|Node:vex/cop2filter]).

This operator returns the area of the current pixel after being
transformed to the new UV coordinate `uvpos`. If extrapolate is on, the
derivatives are extrapolated at the edges of the image.
