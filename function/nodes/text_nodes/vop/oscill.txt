"""Returns an anti-aliased cosine or sine wave."""

This operator returns an anti-aliased cosine or sine wave. The result
can be used to generate wavy displacements or mix between colors.

The argument must be expressed in radians.

The Frequency (`freq`) input multiplies the radian value to increase the
number of oscillations. The Offset (`offset`) input is then added to the
result of the multiplication to produce a shift in the waves.

The Blur (`blur`) input determines the filter width and controls the
softness of the waves. The blur should not be set too low, or aliasing
artifacts may occur.

More trigonometric functions are available in the [Trigonometric
Functions|Node:vop/trig] operator if anti-aliasing is not required.
