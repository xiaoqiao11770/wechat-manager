"""Disturbs the incoming parametric s and t coordinates using anti aliased noise generated from the Surface Position input."""

This operator disturbs the incoming parametric s and t coordinates
using anti aliased noise generated from the Surface Position (`P`) input.

The resulting s and t coordinates can be used as inputs to almost all of
the pattern generators, such as Rings, Boxes, and Stripes.

Optionally, the noise amplitude can be clamped to a specified range. The
clamping is done smoothly using a cubic interpolator. If a rolloff is
specified, the inflection point of the blend will be shifted. If the
rolloff is greater than 1, the shift will be to the right. If the
rolloff is less than 1 (and greater than 0), the shift will be to the
left.

For a denser noise, enable __Compute Absolute Noise Value__. The absolute
value is computed before any clamping takes place.

If the `P`, `s`, and `t` inputs are not connected, the global variables by the
same names will be used instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as `P` inputs. Valid sources for `s` and `t` include
[Shading Layer Parameter|Node:vop/shadinglayer] and [UV Project|Node:vop/uvproject].
