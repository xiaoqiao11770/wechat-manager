"""Provides inputs representing the writable output variables of
the shader network."""

Every VOP network type has a set of global variables associated with it.
These are the variables inherent to the VEX context that the VOP network
operates in. For shading contexts (such as Surface and Displacement)
these will be variables like the position of the point on the geometry
being shaded (`P`), or the normal of the surface at the point being shaded
(`N`). For SOP or POP Operator networks, these variables include the
position of the point being manipulated (`P`), and the point number of the
point being manipulated (`ptnum`).

The inputs on this node are a subset of the outputs available
on the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] node, where the globals
node represents all available global variables and this node
represents new values for the variables you can change.

Every VOP network starts with this node already in the network.
It is possible to delete it (for example, if you only deal with
export variables and don't care about global outputs) but you
should probably avoid doing so.

NOTE:
    This node drives the generation of VEX code from the VOP network.
    Only nodes you directly or indirectly connect to the output node
    will be used to generate shader code.

@parameters

Generate Code for This Node Last:
    You should always have this option turned on unless you have some
    backwards compatibility problem with old shader code.

    When this option is on, the code for this node appears after the
    code for all other nodes in this VOP Network, ensuring global
    variable values are not modified until the very end of the function.
    
Parameter order table:
    Lets you change the order and grouping of shader parameters in the
    generated user interface.
    
    * Drag rows or use the [Icon:BUTTONS/list_reorderup] up-arrow button
      to reorder parameters.
      
    * Click the right-pointing triangle at the end of a parameter row to
      put the parameter inside a new group. Groups appear as tabs in
      the user interface.
      
    * Click a group start row (a row containing a `{` character) to rename
      the group.
