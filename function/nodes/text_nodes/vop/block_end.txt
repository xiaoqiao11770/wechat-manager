= Block End =

"""Marks the end of a code block."""

The Block End node is a generic block end node.  It can
be used with the Block Begin nodes to build loops and conditional
if blocks.

NOTE:
    The block nodes are usually implicitly put down with the higher
    level For Loop, For-Each Loop, While Loop tools.


@parameters
    Paired Block:
	A path to the paired block forming a begin/end block pair.
	Both nodes must be in the same network.  Nodes wired between
	the pair are enclosed in a convex hull and are placed inside
	a code block.  Depending on the types of the begin and end
	blocks, different control flow can be done on the block.

    Enclose Inputs:
	There are two ways to determine which input nodes should
	be put inside of the code block.  If this is not set, they
	are only enclosed if they depend on the outputs of the paired
	begin block.  If this is set, any node that can be moved
	into the block is so moved.

	It is advantageous with if-blocks to move as many nodes inside
	as possible as this avoids executing them if the condition is false.

	It is advantageous with loop-blocks to move as many nodes
	outside as possible to avoid having execute them more than once
	when looping.

    Number of Outputs:
	By default an output is generated for each input.  This allows
	the specification of extra outputs.  If no input wire is present,
	the value is assumed to be `0` and the type must be specified.

	The outputs of an End block are paired with the outputs of the
	Begin block.  If no names are present, the pairing is done in
	order.  If names are present, they are paired by name.
