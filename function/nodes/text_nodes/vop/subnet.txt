"""Contains other VOP operators."""

This operator contains other VOP operators. It generates no code of its
own, and simply acts as a container for a block of functionality.

Use this operator to help organize complex VOP networks. If a network
becomes very large and difficult to navigate, it often helps to collapse
self-contained blocks of functionality into subnets. When doing this,
try to isolate and collapse groups of operators that do not involve
large numbers of external connection.


@inputs
    Next Input:
        Up to 64 inputs can be connected here. Each time an input is
        connected, a new input slot is added.

        All connected inputs mimic the properties of the output wired
        into them. They adopt the same help label and name as the output
        connected to them. If multiple outputs with the same name are
        connected, the names of the inputs are automatically incremented
        to make them unique.

@outputs
    The list of outputs depends on the inputs connected to the Subnet
    Output operator contained in this operator. The data type and name
    of each output will match the corresponding input of the Subnet
    Output operator.
