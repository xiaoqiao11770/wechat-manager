= Bounding Box =

"""Returns two vectors representing the minimum and maximum corners of the bounding box for the specified geometry."""

This operator returns two vectors representing the minimum and maximum corners of the bounding box for the specified geometry.

This generates a primitive bounding box, so primitives like spheres and
volumes will expand it to include their extents.

If no file is given, the first input is used where applicable.

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

File:
    The file on disk to compute the bounding box of.

Primitive Group:
    The subset of primitives to use for computing the bounding box.
    Uses SOP-style syntax, so an empty string means all primitives,
    and adhoc groups such as `0-10` and `@Cd.x>0` can be used.
