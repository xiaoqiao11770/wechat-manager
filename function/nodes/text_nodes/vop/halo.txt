= Halo =

"""Generates a soft halo effect to be used in the Fog context, and
outputs color and alpha."""

This operator generates a soft halo effect to be used in the Fog
context, and outputs color and alpha.

Unlike Glow, which is meant for glows around lights, flames, and other
hot point sources, this operator produces a generic, white-light glow.

The higher the density of the fog, the smaller the radius of the halo.

The Fog Point Size (`fptsize`) controls the size of the fog's center.

The Fog Color (`fcolor`) is multiplied by the Opacity (Of) before being
mixed with the Surface Color, so you do not have to take opacity into
account yourself.

If the Surface Position (`P`), Position of Eye (`Eye`), Surface Color (`Cf`)
Surface Opacity (`Of`), and Surface Alpha (`Af`) inputs are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. If you need
to access the global variables directly, they are available from the
[Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.

For a simple halo, connect the color output (`color`) and the alpha output
(`alpha`) to the `Cf` and respectively `Af` inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output]
operator.
