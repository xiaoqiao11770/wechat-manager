= Blend Regions =

"""Takes a float input as a bias to blend between three input
regions."""

This operator takes a float input as a bias to blend between three input
regions.

The domain of the input is divided into three regions with blurred
boundaries between them. The size (or the contribution) of each region
in the overall domain is given by the two inner boundary inputs
`Threshold 1->2` and `Threshold 2->3`, which act as region delimiters.
Each inner boundary has an associated blur factor.

A bias value below `thresh12` will pick region1. A value between
`thresh12` and `thresh23` will pick region2; and a value greater than
`thresh23` will pick region3.

The data in each region can be any 1D, 3D, or 4D entity such as color,
alpha, position, and so on.
