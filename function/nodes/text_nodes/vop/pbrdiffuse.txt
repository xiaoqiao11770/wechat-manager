"""Produce a normalized diffuse bsdf."""

This node will produce a normalized (reflectivity of 1) diffuse bsdf.
Shaders using this bsdf should adjust the reflectivity by multiplying the
component by an intensity parameter.

@parameters

Component Label:
    #id: label
    #contentfrom: pbrspecular#label

Diffuse Roughness:
    #id: drough

    A floating point value used to control the size or spread of the
    diffuse  component. Higher values make the surface look less
    glossy with flatter color.

@inputs

model:
    This input is unused.

nN:
    Normalized surface normal.

@outputs

f:
    The diffuse bsdf.
