= Integrate 3D Clip =

"""Integrates a 3D image along the line specified by two points."""

This operator integrates a 3D image along the line specified by two
points.

It works by marching along the given ray, integrating the value of
`channel` in the 3D texture space until the sum of the integration
reaches the `limit`. At that point, it stops. The output `limitpos` is
the point position where the limit was reached, and `result` will be 1.

Texture files will be searched for in the path specified by the
`HOUDINI_TEXTURE_PATH` environment variable.


@parameters
    3D Image:
        3D image file used for look-up.
    Channel:
        Channel to be integrated.
    Start Position:
        3D location in the image where to start integrating.
    End Position:
        3D location in the image where to stop integrating.
    Filter Type:
        Type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation. The
        options are:


        Box:
            (string value `box`)
        Gaussian:
            (string value `gauss`)
        Bartlett/Triangular:
            (string value `bartlett`)
        Sinc Sharpening:
            (string value `sinc`)
        Hanning:
            (string value `hanning`)
        Blackman:
            (string value `blackman`)
        Catmull-Rom:
            (string value `catrom`)
        Mitchell:
            (string value `mitchell`)
        Point Sampling:
            (string value `point`)
    Filter Width:
        Filter width in both u and v directions.
    Accuracy:
        If less than 1, limited integration is done. If greater than 1,
        higher quality sampling is performed. The default value is 0.
        Please be cautioned that accurate filtering can be 10 times as
        expensive for even simple data sets.
    Scale:
        Scale the value of the image by the value specified during the
        integration.
