= Brushed Metal Shader =

"""A basic brushed metal shader."""

This shader simulates a metal that has been brushed in a circular pattern.

@parameters

== General ==

Base Color:
    #id: basecolor
    The overall color of the surface.

Roughness:
    #id: rough
    #contentfrom: /nodes/shop/principledshader#rough

== Brush Circles ==

Brush Amount:
    #id: amount

    Controls the strength of the brush effect.

Amount Random:
    #id: amountrand

    Controls how randomized the brush effect is per circle.

Frequency:
    #id: freq

    The frequency of the repeating brush pattern.

Spacing Fraction S:
    #id: soverlap

    How far apart circles are positions as a fraction of their diameter in the _s_ direction.

Spacing Fraction T:
    #id: toverlap

    How far apart circles are positions as a fraction of their diameter in the _t_ direction.

Stagger:
    #id: stagger

    The amount to stagger alternating rows of circles.

Jitter:
    #id: jitter

    Amount to jitter circle positions by.

== Brush Tracks ==

Brush Tracks:
    #id: brushtracks

    Create circular streaks within each circle.

Frequency:
    #id: brushtrackfreq

Random Offset:
    #id: brushtrackoffset

    Offsets the track pattern randomly for each circle

Anisotropic:
    #id: aniso

    Amount of anisotropy.
