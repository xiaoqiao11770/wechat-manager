= Rings =

"""Generates repeating filtered rings."""

This operator generates repeating filtered rings. The output is one if
inside the ring or zero if outside, and can be used to mix between
colors or materials.

If the `s` and `t` inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (`s`,`t`) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.

The random seed output is only valid if using a single layer.
