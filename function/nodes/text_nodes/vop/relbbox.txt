= Relative to Bounding Box =

"""Returns the relative position of the point given with respect to the bounding box of the specified geometry."""

This operator returns the relative position of the point given with with
respect to the bounding box of the specified geometry. This is equivalent
to getting BBX, BBY, BBZ in the [Point SOP|Node:sop/point].

If no position is given, the global `P` variable will be used instead.
In some contexts this may be an error if no such variable has been bound.

If no file is given, the first input is used where applicable.

Because this uses primitive bounding boxes, the group is a primitive
group.  Primitive bounding boxes include the extents of primitives such
as spheres and volumes.

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

File:
    The file on disk to find the relative bounding box location in.

Primitive Group:
    The subset of primitives to use for computing the bounding box.
    Uses SOP-style syntax, so an empty string means all primitives,
    and adhoc groups such as `0-10` and `@Cd.x>0` can be used.
