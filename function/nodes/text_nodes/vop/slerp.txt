= Spherical Linear Interp =

"""Computes a spherical linear interpolation between its two quaternion
inputs, and outputs the intermediate quaternion."""

This operator computes a spherical linear interpolation between its two
quaternion inputs, and outputs the intermediate quaternion.

This interpolation will always be along the shortest arc.
