= Tangent Normals =

"""Exports shader normals as a render plane."""

This node takes existing normals in the shader and outputs them as an optional parameter called `export_normals`. You can set this as an extra image plane in the render node to bake out normal maps.

@outputs

Source:
    #id: source
    
    Choose whether to output normals that have been modified by the shader, or output a difference between a high res and low res geometry.

    Shader Normals:
        Output normals that have been modified by the shader.
        
    Geometry Difference:
        Output normals in the space of the low res geometry using the high resolution geometry. Specify a low-res geometry using the [UV Render Object|Mantra:vm_uvobject] render property on the render node. Both objects must be visible. This will lookup the normals from the high-res geometry and output them in the low-res geometry space.

    TIP:
        When using "Geometry Different" with a high res and low res object, you should use a [Peak SOP|Node:sop/peak] to prevent inter-penetrations artifacts in the normal map.

Space:
    #id: space
    
    The coordinate system in which to output the normals. Use tangent space for deforming objects, so the normals stay relative to the moving surface.
    
    Some target applications might require a certain space for tangent maps. Commonly, game engines and other real time systems use tangent space maps.

Range:
    #id: range
    
    Map the normal data into specific range. Either -1 to 1 or 0 to 1.
