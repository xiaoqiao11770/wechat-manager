= Sensor Panorama Create =

"""Renders the surrounding environment"""

You can specify the resolution of the render performed, the distance of the near and far planes, and what objects are rendered.

@parameters

Time:
    The period in time when the render should be performed.
    
Position:
    The location in world space coordinates where the render should be performed.

Render Size:
    The resolution of the performed render.

Near Plane:
    The near plane restriction.

Far Plane:
    The far plane restriction.

Candidate Objects:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will be displayed if their display setting is enabled.

Include Objects:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will always be displayed.

Exclude Objects:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will never be displayed.

Use Lighting:
    Usually for AI purposes you want to not have any lighting as you are using
    colour as a key to differentiate actors.  However, if you want to display
    what a creature sees, lighting makes things more visually accurate.

@outputs

Panorama:
    An integer handle that represents the rendered panorama.
