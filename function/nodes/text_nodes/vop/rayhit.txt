= Ray Hit =

"""This operator sends a ray from the position `P` along the direction
specified by the direction `D`, and returns the distance to the object
intersected or a negative number if not object found."""

This operator sends a ray from the position `P` along the direction
specified by the direction `D`, and returns the distance to the object
intersected or a negative number if not object found. The position and
normal of the intersected surface are returned in `phit` and `nhit`.

The length of the `D` vector represents the farthest distance considered
when checking for intersections.

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead.
