= Import Light Variable =

"""Imports the value of the specified variable from a light shader and
stores it in `var`."""

This operator imports the value of the specified variable from a light
shader and stores it in `var`. `found` is set to 1 if the variable is
found, otherwise it is set to 0.

If the variable being imported is not found, the value connected to the
default input is assigned to the output value. If no input is
connected to default, the value is initialized to 0.

This function is only valid inside an illuminance loop.
