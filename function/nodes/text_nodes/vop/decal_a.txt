= Decal =

"""An OTL that performs composting of texture maps."""

@parameters
    
    Background/Background Alpha:
        The background color/alpha are the colors to use outside of the decal. They also will be used as a background where the decal image has no color. The output is the color after the decal is applied over the background, and the alpha from the decal composited over the background alpha.
    
    == Decal Texture ==
    
    Texture Map:
        Image file to use as the decal.
    
    Wrap:
        Determines how the image is evaluated when the texture
        coordinates are outside the range 0-1. The options are:
    
        Repeat:
            (string value `repeat`). The image map repeats outside the
            range 0 the range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer component
            of the texture coordinate is ignored.
        Streak:
            (string value `streak`). Texture coordinates are clamped to
            the 0 to 1 range.
        Decal:
            (string value `decal`). Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1
            will evaluate to the border color rather than an image
            color.
    
    Filter Type:
        Type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation. The
        options are:
    
        Box:
            (string value `box`)
        Gaussian:
            (string value `gauss`)
        Bartlett/Triangular:
            (string value `bartlett`)
        Sinc Sharpening:
            (string value `sinc`)
        Catmull-Rom:
            (string value `catrom`)
        Mitchell:
            (string value `mitchell`)
    
    Texture Blur:
        A blur is specified as 0 (no blur) to 1 (blur the entire image). This is a filter based on the number of pixels to blur. If the resolution of the map changes, the amount of blur will change.
    
    == Positioning ==
    
    Allows fine control of positioning the decal's texture. 
    
    X/Y Offset:
        Allows the decal to be translated in UV space. 
    
    X/Y Scale:
        Allows the decal to be scaled in UV space
    
    Rotation:
        Rotates the texture.
