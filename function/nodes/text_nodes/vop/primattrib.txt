= Primitive Attribute =

"""Evaluates an attribute for a given primitive at the specified uv
parametric location."""

This operator evaluates an attribute for a given primitive at the
specified uv parametric location. The result is stored in `adata`, which
can be one of the following types:

{{{
floating-point
integer
vector  (three    floats)
vector4 (four     floats)
matrix3 (nine     floats)
matrix  (sixteen  floats)
}}}
In either case, if the attribute data is of a smaller size than `adata`,
an error of 0 will result. A value of 1 is returned upon successful
completion.

For example, if attribute `Cd` is a vector, `adata` cannot be a matrix or
any another structure which can store more than three values.
