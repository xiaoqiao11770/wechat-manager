= Constant =

"""Outputs a constant value of any VEX data type."""

This operator outputs a constant value of any VEX data type.

Use this operator type to create a value that is not going to change
between different instantiations of the VEX operator defined by the VOP
network. For example, if a shading function required multiplying a value
by 2, or finding the cross product of a vector and { 0, 1, 0 }, the
values 2 and { 0, 1, 0 } would most easily be represented by a Constant VOP. If the value 2 or { 0, 1, 0 } might change depending on the
properties of the material being shaded, a [Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] should be used
instead.

Unlike this operator, the [Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] allows the specification of a
different value for each instantiation of the OP type that uses this VOP
network. For example, if you want the surface color to be accessed by a
Surface shader (SHOP) using this VOP network, make the color a [Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] instead of a Constant.

@parameters
    Constant Type:
        Specifies the VEX data type of the value output by this
        operator. In some cases there is more than one way to represent
        a VEX data type. For example, the vector type can be represented
        by 3 float values, or a single color value. This parameter also
        specifies how the VEX value should be represented. This
        determines which parameter to use to define the value output
        from this operator.
    Default Values:
        Represents the value of the constant in the VEX function.
    Constant Name:
        The name of the constant defined by this operator, both in the
        generated VEX code and on the operator tile's output.
@outputs
    Constant Value:
        The value specified by the parameters of this operator.
