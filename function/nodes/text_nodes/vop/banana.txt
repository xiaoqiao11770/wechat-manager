= Banana Skin =

"""Generates a material that simulates banana skin."""

This operator generates a material that simulates banana skin.

The amount of ripeness (or age) determines the color of the banana and
the amount of brown blemish, and ranges between zero and one.

If the Normal (`N`) input and the texture coordinate (`s` and `t`) inputs are
not connected, the global variables by the same names will be used
instead. Typically, you will leave `N` alone unless you want to displace
the surface before the final color calculation (see [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]). You
will likely use the Shading Layer Parameter as the input for `s` and
`t`. If you need to access the global variables directly, they are
available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
