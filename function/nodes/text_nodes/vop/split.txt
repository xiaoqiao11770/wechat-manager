"""Splits a string into tokens."""

Splits a string into tokens by removing separator characters from the string
and creating an array entry for each substring bounded by separators. When no
separator string is provided, the string is split on whitespace (spaces, tab,
and return).

The `maxsplits` parameter limits the number of times the string is split,
this is useful to peel off one token at a time from a larger string.

NOTE:
    This differs from Python's split() in that it takes a list of separators, not a single string to use as a separator.

@inputs
    String:
	The string to split.
    Separators:
	The separators to split the string on.
    Max Splits:
	The maximum number of splits to perform.

@outputs
    Split String:
	An array of string tokens the input string was split into.
