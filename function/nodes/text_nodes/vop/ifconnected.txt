= If Connected =

"""Passes through the value of the first input if the first input is
ultimately connected."""

This operator passes through the value of the first input if the first
input is ultimately connected. If the first input is not ultimately
connected, it outputs the value of the second input. If neither input is
connected, the operator outputs the value specified in the Defaults
section of the operator parameters.

An input is not ultimately connected if it has no immediate link, or if
it has a link that comes directly from a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subinput] operator, and the
parent subnetwork has no corresponding input connection, or that
connection is also a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subinput]  operator, and so on.

Thus, if an input is directly connected to a [Subnet Inputs|Node:vop/subinput]  operator, it
is not considered to be ultimately connected unless the parent network
provides an ultimately connected link to it.

This operator is effectively a combination of two operators: an [Is
Connected|Node:vop/isconnected] test followed by a [Two Way Switch|Node:vop/twoway].
