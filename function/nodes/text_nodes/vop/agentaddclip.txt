= agentaddclip =

"""Add a clip into an agent's definition."""

== Overview ==

This adds a `.clip` or `.bclip` file saved from a CHOP (or generated by an
[Node:out/agent] ROP) to the definition of the given agent primitive.
Clips in an agent definition contains transform animation for driving the
agent's skeleton. 

The channels within the clip should of the form `transform_name:channel_name`
where _transform_name_ is a string matching the values returned by the
[Node:vop/agenttransformnames] VOP and _channel_name_ is one of `tx`, `ty`,
`tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz`, `sx`, `sy`, or `sz`. The channels starting with `t`
denote translation, `r` denote rotation, and `s` denote scale. The
resulting transforms will be treated as _local_ transforms, such as those
returned by the [Node:vop/agenttransforms] VOP (ie. they are relative to
the corresponding parent transform in the agent's skeleton).

@parameters

Geometry Handle:
    Refers to what geometry to write to. The default of 0 means the currently processed geometry.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive whose definition is to be
    modified.

Clip Name:
    The name to identify the clip. All clips in an agent definition must have
    unique names.

Clip Path:
    The filename of the `.clip` or `.bclip` file saved from a CHOP or generated
    by the [Node:out/agent] ROP. Use `op:full_path_to_chop` to directly refer
    to a CHOP in the scene.

Keep External Reference:
    When `clippath` refers to a filename on disk, this boolean flag indicates
    whether the external reference should be maintained when the geometry will
    be saved. If the reference is maintained, then the original source of the
    clip needs to be available when the saved geometry is used. Otherwise, a
    copy of the clip will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the
    original clip is no longer needed.
