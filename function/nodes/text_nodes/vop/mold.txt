= Mold =

"""Simulates anti-aliased mold."""

This operator simulates anti-aliased mold.

You will first generate a material that outputs a color, then pipe its
output into the Surface Color input of this operator.

The Mold Threshold (`mthresh`) input controls the contribution of the
rotting agents, and represents a good candidate for animation at the
shader level if tied to a [Parameter|Node:vop/parameter] operator. The lower the `mthresh`
value, the greater the overall moldy area. To increase the percentage of
core mold in the overall moldy area, bump up the value of the Core Mold
Amplifier (`coremult`) parameter.

If the Surface Position (`P`), Normal Vector (`N`) and Surface Color (`Cf`)
inputs are not connected, the global variables by the same name will be
used instead. Typically, you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg]
as inputs for `P`, and any operator that yields a lit color, such as
[Shiny Metal|Node:vop/shinymetal] or [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting], as inputs for `Cf`. You will not need to
touch `N` unless you wish to apply additional displacement to the mold.
If you need to access the global variables directly, they are available
from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
