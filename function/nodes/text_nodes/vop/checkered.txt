= Checkered =

"""Returns number between 0 and 1 which defines a checkered pattern useful for visualizing parametric or texture coordinates."""

This function returns a number between 0 and 1 which defines a checkered pattern useful for visualizing parametric or texture coordinates.

@inputs

s:
    U coordinate. This should be connected to the _s_ output of
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, 
    the global _s_ will be used instead.

t:
    V coordinate. This should be connected to the _t_ output of the 
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, the global _t_ 
    will be used instead.

s_freq:
    The number of squares along the _s_ direction.

t_freq:
    The number of squares along the _t_ direction.

@outputs

sum:
    This is a float between 0 and 1.
