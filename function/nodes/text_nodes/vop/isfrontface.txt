= Is Front Face =

"""Returns true if the normal of the surface is forward facing, and
false if it isn't."""

This operator returns true if the normal of the surface is forward
facing, and false if it isn't.

If `I `or `N` are not wired, the global variables by the same names will be
used instead. Neither vector needs to be normalized.
