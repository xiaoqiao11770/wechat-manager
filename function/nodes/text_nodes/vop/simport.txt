= Import Surface Variable =

"""Imports the value of the specified variable from a surface shader and
stores it in `var`."""

This operator imports the value of the specified variable from a surface
shader and stores it in `var`. `found` is set to 1 if the variable is
found, otherwise it is set to 0.

If the variable being imported is not found, the value connected to the
`default` input is assigned to the output value. If no input is
connected to `default`, the value is initialized to 0.
