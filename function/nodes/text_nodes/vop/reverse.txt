"""Adds an item to an array or string."""

Returns an array in the reverse order.

The string version likewise returns a reversed string.

NOTE:
    For strings, this reverses the logical characters of the string, not the bytes of the string.  This means that UTF-8 strings are reversed as expected, but differs from the behavior of the `::-1` slice function.

@inputs
    Array:
	The array to reverse.

@outputs
    Reversed:
	The array in reversed order.
