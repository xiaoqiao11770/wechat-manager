= Ray Trace =

"""Sends a ray starting at origin P and in the direction specified by
the normalized vector D."""

This operator sends a ray starting at origin `P` and in the direction
specified by the normalized vector `D`. The resulting color, opacity and
alpha will be returned.

The __Bias__ parameter is typically a small number used to prevent
self-shading. The __Max Contribution__ parameter is used to give the
renderer an idea of how much the result of the Trace operator will
contribute to the resulting pixel color, but has no effect on the
results of the trace.

If the position (`P`) input is not connected, the global variable by the
same name will be used instead.
