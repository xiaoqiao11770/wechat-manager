= Point Cloud Unshaded =

"""This node advances to the next unshaded iteration point returned by pcopen."""

The pcunshaded VOP will either start a new unshaded point iteration or
advance to the next iteration point.  Unshaded iteration differs from
iteration since points will only be iterated over once, so that
per-point calculations can be performed once and filtered many times.  The
pcunshaded VOP should normally be used as input to a while loop condition,
with [Node:vop/pcimport] operations inside the loop to gather iteration
point information and [Node:vop/pcexport] operations to store shaded
information.  The pcunshaded VOP corresponds to the [Vex:pcunshaded] VEX
function.

You should usually iterate through all points in the point cloud.  If you
don't iterate over all points, it is necessary to use the [Node:vop/pcclose] VOP to close the point cloud before other operations are performed in the shader.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for iteration.

channel:
    The channel that will be initialized by the pcunshaded loop.  You
    should use [Node:vop/pcexport] nodes to fill in unshaded data.

@outputs

success:
    Returns 1 when the iteration was successful, in which case point data
    can be queried using pcimport.
