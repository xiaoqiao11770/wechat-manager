= Crackle =

"""Returns float between 0 and 1 which defines a crackle pattern useful for simulating the fine grain texture in skin or on a much larger scale dried mudflats."""

This operator uses the _frequency_ as the input for 2 [Node:vop/cellnoise] vops. The _frequency_ is doubled for the second [Node:vop/cellnoise] and the output scaled by the _secondary contribution_. The 2 results are added together and fit into a 0 to 1 range. It can be used in a displacement shader with the output used as the displacement amount. This value can be made an export parameter for import into the surface shader to control color or other parameters. Crackle can also be used in the surface shader to choose color or affect the color intensity when displacement is not needed or desirable.

@inputs

s:
    S coordinate. This should be connected to the _s_ output of
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, 
    the global _s_ will be used instead.

t:
    T coordinate. This should be connected to the _t_ output of the 
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, the global _t_ 
    will be used instead.

Crack Frequency:
    The frequency of the crackle pattern. Higher value result in a finer grain.
    This value is doubled for the secondary [Node:vop/cellnoise].

Crack Width:
    The width of the crackle lines. Default is 0.1.

Crack Softness:
    The softness of the crackle lines. Default is 0.2.

Secondary Contribution:
    This controls the contribution of the secondary cracks. Default is 0.2.

@outputs

sum:
    A number between 0 and 1.
