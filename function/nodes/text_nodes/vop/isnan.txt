= Is NAN =

"""Returns 1 if the number is not a number."""

This operator returns 1 if the provided number is not a number.

As nonsensical as "not a number" sounds, NANs are a defined value which floating point numbers can have on computers.  They represent numbers that shouldn't happen and will propagate through all additions, multiplications, etc.

VEX will try not to generate these numbers, but incoming geometry or fields may introduce them to the system.
