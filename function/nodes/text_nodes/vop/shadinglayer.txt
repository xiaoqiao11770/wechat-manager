"""Creates a parameter to appear in the signature of the VEX function
defined by the VOP network (VOPNET)."""

This operator creates a parameter to appear in the signature of the VEX
function defined by the VOP network (VOPNET). The new parameter is named
according to the chosen geometry attribute and the specified layer.

Unlike the Parameter operator, which creates parameters of any name and
type, Shading Layer computes the parameter name from the name of the
geometry attribute and the specified layer. For example, choosing __UV
Coordinates__ from the attribute menu will generate `uv`, `uv2`, `uv3`
when the layer is 1 and respectively 2 and 3. The parameter type matches
the type of the selected geometry attribute.

This operator always checks if the geometry attribute is bound and, if
so, assigns its value to the new parameter. Thus, the new parameter will
be hidden in the operator type defined by the VOP network.

One of the most common uses of this operator is the creation of layered
textures, which requires different sets of texture coordinates for each
Texture operator. To accomplish this task, choose __UV Coordinates__ from
this operator's attribute menu and set the appropriate layer. Pipe the
`uv` output into a [Vector To Float|Node:vop/vectofloat] operator to extract the `s` and `t`
as individual float values, then wire `s` and `t` into the [Texture|Node:vop/texture]
operator. Repeat this operation for all the layers, then add or multiply
the all Texture outputs using the [Add|Node:vop/add] or [Multiply|Node:vop/multiply] operator
respectively.

@parameters
    Geometry Attribute:
        The attribute to be searched for in the given layer. The
        following attributes are available in this operator:

        {{{
        Label          | Name  | Type     | Default If Not Bound
        ---------------+-------+----------+---------------------------
        UV Coordinates | uv    | 3 floats | { global s, global t, .5 }
        RGB Color      | Cd    | 3 floats | { 1, 1, 1} (i.e. white)
        Alpha          | Alpha | 1 float  | 1          (i.e. opaque)
        }}}
        Geometry attributes are created in the Geometry module using a
        variety of SOP operators such as: AttribCreate, Attribute,
        Point, UV Project, UV Texture, UV Unwrap, etc.

    Use This Node to Set Parameter Attributes:
        When several Shading Layer VOPs have the same Geometry Attribute
        chosen, only one of the nodes is used to control the settings of
        the attribute. Houdini decides which node to use for this by
        searching all the nodes according to the user defined order,
        then traversing inside subnets. If none of them have this
        parameter turned on, the first one found is used to set the
        parameter attributes. If one or more do have this option turned
        on, the first one with this option is used, even if another node
        (with this option turned off) is found first.
    Attribute Layer:
        Attribute layer where to search for the geo attribute. Layer 1
        is the default layer. Attributes in this layer do not have a
        suffix. Layers are created in the Geometry module using the
        Layer SOP.
    Export:
        Specifies whether the new parameter can be exported to other
        contexts (written to as well as read from). If set to __Always__ or
        __When Input is Connected__, this operator gets an input.  The value
        wired into this input is then assigned to the exported parameter.
        In a Surface network, exported parameters can be used to create
        deep rasters.

        Never:
            The parameter will not be exported.
        Always:
            The parameter will be exported.
        When Input is Connected:
            The parameter will only be exported if the node's input is
            ultimately connected to another VOP.
@inputs
    Export Value:
        The value assigned to the new parameter if the __Export
        Parameter__ toggle is checked.
@outputs
    Output Parameter:
        The value of this VEX function parameter.
    Is Parameter Bound:
        True is the new parameter is bound to an attribute.
