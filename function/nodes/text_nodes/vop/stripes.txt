= Stripes =

"""Generates repeating filtered stripes."""

This operator generates repeating filtered stripes. The output is one if
the point is in a stripe, zero if not, and can be used to mix between
colors or materials.

If the `s` input is not connected, the global variable `s` will be used
instead. If the `s` input is not specified, a global variable appropriate
to the current context will be used instead, as follows: s in the
shading contexts; P.x in the geometry and particle contexts; and X in
the compositing context.
