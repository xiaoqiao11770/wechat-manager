= Method Call =

"""Invokes a given method on a given struct or co-shader object."""

== Overview ==

The Method Call node represents a method call on a struct or co-shader object. The object is provided on the first input connector, and then the parameter menu will list all available methods. Once a method is selected, the node will present additional inputs and outputs. These inputs correspond to the method arguments, while the outputs represent the return value and any output
arguments.

If the method definition is marked as variadic, this node allows arbitrary number of inputs, which will become method call arguments.

If the method definition does not provide an explicit return type, the __Return Type__ parameter will appear and will allow an override to a desired type.

@parameters
    Method Name:
	When a co-shader with a given type is connected to the input, this menu will list all the available methods defined in that incoming co-shader class or struct.

@inputs
    The inputs are dependent on the method specified in the parameter.
    
    The first input is the co-shader or struct object on which to invoke the method. The remaining inputs correspond to the method arguments.

@outputs
    The outputs are dependent on the method specified in the parameter.

    The first output represents the return value and the remaining ones correspond to the method output arguments.
