= Unique Values of Attribute =

Returns a unique value from an integer or string attribute.

TIP:
    The `op:/ syntax` can be used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

@parameters

Signature:
    What type of attribute data to fetch. 

Geometry File:
    The file on disk to fetch an attribute from.

Attribute Class:
    Attributes can be stored on points, vertices, primitives, or even as global attributes (__Detail__). The class refers to where to look for it. It will adjust the meaning of __Point__ or __Primitive__ and __Vertex__.

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to fetch. `id` fetches the common id attribute, and `name` will fetch the name.

Index:
    The geometry will usually have multiple unique values for the attribute.  This is which of them to return.
