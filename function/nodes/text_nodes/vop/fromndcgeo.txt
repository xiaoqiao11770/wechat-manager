= From NDC =

"""Transforms a position from normal device coordinates to the
coordinates in the appropriate space."""

This operator transforms a position from normal device coordinates to
the coordinates in the given camera.

@parameters
Position In NDC Space:
    This is the position of a point in NDC space which is to be transformed into the camera's space.  The resulting point will be in geometry space (i.e. SOP space).
Camera Name:
	The name of the camera object

@outputs
	The position of the point in geometry space.
