= Agent Rig Find =

"""Finds the index of a transform in an agent primitive's rig."""

Returns `-1` if the transform name was not found in the rig, the primitive number is out of range, or the primitive is not an agent.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Transform Name:
    The name of a transform in the agent's rig.
