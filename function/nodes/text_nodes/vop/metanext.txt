= Meta-Loop Next =

"""Takes a handle generated by the Meta-Loop Start operator and will
"iterate" to the ..."""

This operator takes a handle generated by the [Meta-Loop Start|Node:vop/metastart] operator
and will iterate to the next metaball in the file. This function must
be called at least one time before the [Meta-Loop Import|Node:vop/metaimport] operator may be
invoked.

When using this in a while or for loop operator, the generated code
should be inspected carefully to verify that the Meta-Loop Next operator is
being called in the correct place in the loop.
