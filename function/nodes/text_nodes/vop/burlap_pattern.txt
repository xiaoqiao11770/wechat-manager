= Burlap Pattern =

"""Returns float between 0 and 1 which defines a burlap pattern useful for simulating rough cloth or weave patterns."""

Typically, this operator is used in a displacement shader with the output used as the displacement amount. This value can be made an export parameter for import into the surface shader to control the color. If the parametric coordinates, `s` or `t`, are made constant, rippled stripes can be generated in each parametric direction.

@inputs

s:
    U coordinate. This should be connected to the _s_ output of
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, 
    the global _s_ will be used instead.

t:
    V coordinate. This should be connected to the _t_ output of the 
    [uvcoords|/nodes/vop/uvcoords]. If it is not connected, the global _t_ 
    will be used instead.

freq:
    The frequency determines the density of the fibers.

offset:
    This allows the pattern to be shifted along the surface through the texture coordinates.

rough:
    The roughness controls the fiber coarseness.

@outputs

pattern:
    This is a float between 0 and 1.
