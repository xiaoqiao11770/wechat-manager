"""Simulates a chrome material defined solely by an environment map and
a normal direction."""

This operator simulates a chrome material defined solely by an
environment map and a normal direction. Unlike other chrome solutions,
this one does not use a reflection model, thus avoiding the costs of
ray-tracing.

This type of chrome shader was popular in the 1980's. Despite its
obvious limitations, it remains useful today thanks to its speed and
simplicity.

If the Surface Normal (`N`) input is not connected, the global variable by
the same name will be used instead. Typically, you will not link `N`
unless you want to displace the surface before performing the chrome
calculations. [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise] is one of many candidates for surface
displacement. If you do need `N` itself, you will find it in the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.

See [how to create an environment/reflection map|/render/envmaps].
