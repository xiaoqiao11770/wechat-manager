= Intersect =

"""Computes the intersection of a ray with geometry."""

This operator computes the intersection of the specified ray with the
geometry, and returns the number of the hit primitive or -1. In the case
of multiple intersections, the one closest to the ray origin will be
used.

If a metaball is hit, the returned primitive number will be the number of
primitives in the geometry (to separate this case from that of a miss) as the
specific metaball can't be meaningfully identified.

The uv values are the intrinsic interpolation coordinates for the underlying geometric primitive. For a triangle, they represent the barycentric coordinates of the triangle. For other primitives they may represent other values, such as parametric coordinates. They are not tied to any attribute values.

In order to use these values, you would need to interpolate an attribute for a primitive at the given coordinate. Please see the [Vex:prim_attribute] function, which takes these coordinates for evaluation.

TIP:
    Intersect will only check for intersections within the maximum length
    of the __Ray Direction__ - `[0, length(raydir)]`.
