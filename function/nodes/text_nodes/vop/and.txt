= And =

"""Performs a logical "and" operation between its inputs and returns 1 or 0."""

This operator performs a logical "and" operation between its inputs and
returns 1 (if all inputs are non-zero) or 0 (if at least one input is
zero).

Typically, "and" is used as an input to conditional operators such as [If|Node:vop/if]
and [While|Node:vop/while]. All inputs and the output data type are integers.


@parameters
    Bitwise Operation:
	Instead of any non-zero value being treated the same, the input is
	broken into individual bits and the operation performed on them.

@inputs
    Input Number 1...N:
        The input values to be combined together.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.

@outputs
    Combined Value:
        The logical "and" combination of all inputs.
