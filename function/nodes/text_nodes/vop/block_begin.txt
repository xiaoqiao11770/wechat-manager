"""Marks the start of a code block."""

See [looping in VOP networks|/shade/looping] for general information on how to use this node. Tools in the __Flow control__ submenu of the ((Tab)) menu will create paired blocks for you, so you don't have to create this node manually.

This node can be paired with a [Block End While|Node:vop/block_end_while] to create a block that executes once and then checks a condition.

@parameters

Paired Block:
    The path to the corresponding block end node. Both nodes must be in the same network.

Number of Outputs:
    Lets you add [looping variables|/shade/looping#variables] gre

	By default an output is generated for each input.  This allows
	the specification of extra outputs.  If no input wire is present,
	the value is assumed to be `0` and the type must be specified.

	The outputs of an End block are paired with the outputs of the
	Begin block.  If no names are present, the pairing is done in
	order.  If names are present, they are paired by name.
