= Random =

"""Generates a random number based on the position in one, three, or
four dimensions."""

This operator generates a random number based on the position in one,
three, or four dimensions. Unlike the noise functions, which smoothly
interpolate the random values between integer lattice points, this
random number generator does not. Each number is in the `[0..1)` range.

In the __Signature__ parameter refers to the types of the inputs and outputs. Color and vector are 3 floats, and points are four floats.

NOTE:
    This VOP only produces different numbers for each integer value of the
    input, not for each float value like the [VEX
    hscript_rand|/vex/functions/hscript_rand] does. 

    Turning off the Clamp Position to Integer Values will give different
    results for different inputs, but be warned that very small floating
    point differences *will* then have big changes in the result.
