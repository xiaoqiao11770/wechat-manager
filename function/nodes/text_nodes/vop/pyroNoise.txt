= Pyro Noise =

#type: node
#context: vop
#internal: pyroNoise

This node adds a __Field Operation__ parameter to the
[Unified Noise VOP|Node:vop/unifiednoise], allowing you to choose between
additive and multiplicative noise.

This node also lets you choose between vector and float output, and 3D and
4D noise, using separate parameters instead of a single "signature" 
parameter. This makes it easier to control in a promoted interface.
