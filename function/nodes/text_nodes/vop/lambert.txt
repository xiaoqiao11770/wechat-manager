"""Generates a color using the Lambert diffuse lighting model calculation."""

This VOP uses the Lambert lighting model calculation to generate the diffuse color
contribution for a material. Typically its color is the main surface color of the material. 
This lighting model is often used as base for materials where specular is added.

@inputs

nN:
    The normal vector is used in the Lambert diffuse calculation.
	The normal should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input, 
	and front-face calculation is optional but recommended. 
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `N`, is used.

nI:
    The incidence direction ray used in the face forward calculation.
	The incident vector should be normalized if explicitly connected as an input. 
	Implicitly, the normalized global variable, `I`, is used.

Kd:
    The diffuse intensity.
	A floating point value used to darken or lighten diffuse contribution. 

diff:
    The diffuse color. This color is most often the main surface color of the material.

facefwd:
    This toggle will change the normal to face forward towards the camera.
	It is recommended this toggle be on.

@outputs

color:
    The Lambert diffuse color contribution:

    {{{
    Kd * diff * diffuse(nN)
    }}}

illum:
    Just Lambert diffuse lighting without the multiplication by the diffuse
	intensity or the diffuse color.
	Usually used as an export parameter for extra images planes used in the composite.

bsdf:
    The PBR diffuse calculation.
