= Add Primitive =

""" Adds primitives to the geometry. """

The returned value is a primitive number that can be used with the [Set Attribute
VOP|Node:vop/setattrib] to change the value of the primitive, but is _not_ the final
primitive number of the primitive.

This only works in certain VOP contexts where geometry creation is enabled. In particular, the [Geometry VOP DOP|Node:dop/geometryvop], [Geometry Wrangle DOP|Node:dop/geometrywrangle], [POP VOP DOP|Node:dop/popvop], [POP Wrangle DOP|Node:dop/popwrangle], [Attrib VOP SOP|Node:sop/attribvop], [Attrib Wrangle SOP|Node:sop/attribwrangle], [Volume VOP SOP|Node:sop/volumevop], [Volume
Wrangle SOP|Node:sop/volumewrangle].

NOTE:
        All geometry creation is done after all the elements have been processed. Therefore, you cannot read from geometry you just created.

@parameters

Geometry Handle:
    Refers to what geometry to write to.  The default of 0 means the currently processed geometry.

Type:
    What sort of primitive to create.
