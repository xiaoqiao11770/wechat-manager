= Distance Point to Line =

"""Returns the closest distance between a point and a line segment
defined by two end points."""

The distance from the point `q` to the closest point the line segment
from p1 to p2 is returned. The line segment is used, not an infinitely
extended line, so if `q` is in line with p1 to p2, but not _between_
p1 and p2, the closest distance to the line segment is returned.
