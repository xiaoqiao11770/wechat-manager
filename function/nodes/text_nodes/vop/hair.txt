"""Simulates the look of hair."""

This operator simulates the look of hair.

The most important parameter is __Hair Width__ (`width`), which controls the
width of the hair. You can create a float Point attribute
called `width` using the [AttribCreate SOP|Node:sop/attribcreate] in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms], and assign it to the curves representing the hairs to be shaded. This allows you to control the width of the hair based on the length, or some
other attribute, of each hair.

The roundness of each hair is determined by the value of the __Bump Scale__
(`scale`) input.

If the Normal Vector (`N`) and S Texture Coordinate (`s`) inputs are not
connected, the global variables by the same names will be used instead.
Typically, you will use the __Shading Layer__ parameter as the input for `s` and
you will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement
to the hair surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to access the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
