= Depth Map =

"""Works on an image which was rendered as a z-depth image, returning
the distance from the camera to the pixel (or plane) in
question."""

This operator works on an image which was rendered as a z-depth image,
returning the distance from the camera to the pixel (or plane) in
question.

There is no area sampling done when sampling depth values. As well, if
the u and v values are not in the range 0 to 1, a value of `1E6` will be
returned (indicating a `far` value).
