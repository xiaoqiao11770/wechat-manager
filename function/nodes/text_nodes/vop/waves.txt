"""Simulates rolling waves with choppiness of various frequencies, and
outputs the positional and normal displacements as well
as the amount of displacement."""

This operator simulates rolling waves with choppiness of various
frequencies, and outputs the positional and normal displacements as well
as the amount of displacement.

The wave displacement is anti-aliased, while the choppiness has been
purposefully left aliased to simulate shimmering.

The main use of this operator is to simulate lake or pool water, but it
is also applicable to sand dunes and softly rolling terrain. If you are
using it for water, see the Water Surface operator as a possible surface
shader to use in conjunction with this operator.

The Displacement Scale (`scale`) input determines the amount of overall
displacement of the rolling waves and choppy elements. Use the Chop
Amount (`camount`) input to control only the choppy displacement.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both `disp` outputs piped into the matching inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator. Alternatively, it can appear in a surface shader, in which
case the displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the
`nN` input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the Position (`P`) input and the Normal (`N`) input are not connected,
the global variables by the same names will be used instead. Typically
you will use [Rest Position|Node:vop/restpos] or [UV Space Change|Node:vop/uvspacechg] as inputs for `P`, and
will not touch `N` unless you want to apply additional displacement to
the surface using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise]. If you need to access
the global variables directly, they are available from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator.
