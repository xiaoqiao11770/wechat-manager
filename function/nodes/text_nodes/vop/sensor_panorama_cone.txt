= Sensor Panorama Cone =

"""Returns an average direction, color, depth, and strength."""

Given a panorama, cone restrictions, and calue restrictions - an average direction, color, depth, and strength is returned. By specifying the cone restrictions along with the depth and color restrictions, average values within these restrictions is returned. This includes the average direction, color, and depth of the samples within all the restrictions, along with the proportion of all samples within the cone angle that are also within the sample restrictions.

@parameters

Handle:
    The panorama handle that will be lookup up.

Direction:
    The direction of the lookup cone.

Angle:
    The maximum angle between the cone direction and potential lookup values.

Minimum Color:
    The minimum color to be considered.

Maximum Color:
    The maximum color to be considered.

Minimum Depth:
    The minimum depth to be considered.

Maximum Depth:
    The maximum depth to be considered.

@outputs

Direction:
    The average direction of all samples within the cone, color, and depth restrictions.

Color:
    The average color of all samples within the cone, color, and depth restrictions.

Depth:
    The average depth of all samples within the cone, color, and depth restrictions.

Strength:
    The percentage of samples within the cone restriction that are within the depth and color restrictions.
