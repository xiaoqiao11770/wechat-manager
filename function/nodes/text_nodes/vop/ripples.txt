= Ripples =

"""Generates repeating ripples."""

This operator generates repeating ripples. The output is a number
between 0 and 1, centered at 0.5, and can be used to mix between colors
or materials or to displace geometry.

If the `s` and `t` inputs are not specified, global variables appropriate to
the current context will be used instead, as follows: (`s`,`t`) in the
shading contexts; (P.x,P.y) in the geometry and particle contexts; and
(X,Y) in the compositing context.

The `s` and `t` are similar to texture coordinates. It's the place in the surface
where ripples need to be evaluated.

@parameters

S Frequency:
    Scales the `s` coordinate.

T Frequency:
    Scales the `t` coordinate.

S Offset:
    How much to offset the `s` coordinate.
    
T Offset:
    How much to offset the `t` coordinate.

Decay:
    How quickly the ripples decay.
Wave Time:
    Used to move the waves.
