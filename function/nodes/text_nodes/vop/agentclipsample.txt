= Agent Clip Sample =

"""Samples an agent's animation clip at a specific time."""

Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the local or world transforms of the agent's rig.
Returns an empty array if the clip name is not one of the agent's [animation clips|Node:vop/agentclipcatalog], the primitive number is out of range, the primitive is not an agent, or the transform index is [out of range|Vex:agenttransformcount].

@parameters

Signature:
    Specifies whether to sample a specific transform or all of the agent's transforms.
    
Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Clip Name:
    The name of the animation clip.

Clip Time:
    The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at. If this time is greater than the [clip's length|Node:vop/agentcliplength], it will be wrapped around.

Transform Index:
    Index of a transform in the agent's rig.

Space:
    Specifies whether to return the transforms in local space or world space.
