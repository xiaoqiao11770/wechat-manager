"""Slices a sub-string or sub-array of a string or array."""

Extracts a string or array from a larger array.

If start or end are negative, they refer to distances from the end of the array.

The final range to extract is clamped to the bounds of the original array.

If step is zero, it is an error and an empty string or array is returned.

If step is negative, the end should be below the start.

end is not included in the resulting slice.  Thus if start and end are the
same, an empty string or slice is returned.

@inputs
    Array:
	The array to perform slice operation on.
    Start:
	The starting element in the new array. Included in the result.
    End:
	The ending element in the new array. Not included in result.

@outputs
    Slice:
	The sliced array.
