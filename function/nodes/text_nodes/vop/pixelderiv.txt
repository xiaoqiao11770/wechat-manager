= Pixel Derivative =

"""Returns U and V derivatives of the current pixel."""

This VOP is available in the compositing node definition contexts
([VEX Compositing Generator|Node:vex/cop2gen]
and [VEX Compositing Filter networks|Node:vex/cop2filter]).

This operator returns U and V derivatives of the current pixel. If
extrapolate is on, the derivatives are extrapolated at the edges of the
image.
