"""Detects obstacles in an agent's field of view."""

This node computes the time to collision for a range of samples throughout the agent's field of view.
The output is suitable for use with the [Fuzzy Input VOP|Node:vop/fuzzyinput] to make decisions based on which directions are obstructed.

@parameters

Particle Scale:
    Radius of the particle to use for collision detection.

Max Distance:
    Maximum search distance for an intersection.

Samples:
    The number of rays to cast throughout the __Horizontal FOV__.

Horizontal FOV:
    Field of view (in degrees) in the horizontal direction.

Max Collision Time:
    The reported collision times will be clamped between zero and this value.
    This can be used to ensure that the collision times fall in the crisp range used on a [Fuzzy Input VOP|Node:vop/fuzzyinput].

@outputs

A float array containing the time to collision for each sample in the __Horizontal FOV__.
