= Transform Matrix =

Transforms an input position, normal, or vector by a matrix specified by the translate, rotate, and scale parameters.

@parameters

Signature:
    Switch between 3D and 4D Position.

Position/4D Position:
    The input position to be transformed by the matrix built by the other parameters.

Transform Order:
    The order in which transforms are applied. For example, scale first, then rotate, then translate. This can change the position and orientation of the object, in the same way that going a block and turning east takes you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

Rotation Order:
    Order in which rotations occur.

Translate:
    Amount of translation along the xyz axes.

Rotate:
    Amount of rotation about xyz axes.

Scale:
    Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.

Pivot:
    Local pivot point for transformations.
