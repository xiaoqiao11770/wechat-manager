"""Generates a burlap displacement pattern useful for simulating rough
cloth or weave patterns."""

This operator generates a burlap displacement pattern useful for
simulating rough cloth or weave patterns.

The __Frequency__ parameter determines the density of the fibers, while
Roughness controls the fiber coarseness. The __Height__ parameter gives the
pattern more or less depth. The __Offset__ parameter shifts the whole
pattern along the connected parametric directions.

Typically, this operator will be used in a displacement shader, with
both outputs piped into the corresponding inputs of the [Output Variables|Node:vop/output] operator.
Alternatively, it can be appear in a surface shader, in which case the
displaced normal would be normalized and then connected to the `nN`
input of the [Lighting Model|Node:vop/lighting] operator.

If the parametric coordinate inputs s and t are not connected, the
global variables by the same names will be used instead. Usually, you
will use the global s and t from the [Global Variables|Node:vop/global] operator. Other
options include using UV Project and the __Shading Layer__ parameter. By
making s or t constant, you can generate rippled stripes in each
parametric direction.

The input normal (`nN`) should be normalized if explicitly connected.
Usually, you will not need to touch `nN` unless you want to apply an
additional displacement using an operator such as [Bump Noise|Node:vop/bumpnoise].
