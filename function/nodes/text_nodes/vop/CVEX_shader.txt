"""Container for a CVEX shader implementation."""

The CVEX Shader VOP is basically the VOP representation of the [VOP CVEX SHOP|Node:shop/vopcvex]. It is a container for a CVEX shader that can be wired to VOP procedurals with CVEX shader inputs, such as Fur. 

NOTE:
   All parameter VOPs created in the CVEX Shader produce new inputs.
