"""Produce a hair BSDF."""

This node will produce a BSDF for rendering the primary reflection of hair. Typically, this node should be combined with [secondary reflection|/nodes/vop/pbrhair_trt] and [transmission|/nodes/vop/pbrhair_tt] components.

The [Hair Model VOP|Node:vop/hairmodel] combines all three BSDFs to get the overall hair effect.

@parameters

Component Label:
    #id: label
    #contentfrom: pbrspecular#label

Reflection Color:
    #id: r_clr

    The reflectivity of the color components (red, green, and blue). For
    example, specifying ` 1 0 0 ` results in the reflection of red light
    only.

Reflection Size:
    #id: r_size

    Controls the angular spread of the reflection. Low values result in
    reflection over a narrow cone of angles, and high values result in
    reflection over a broader cone.

Reflection Shift:
    #id: r_shift

    Controls the general direction of the reflection. Values range from
    `-1` (towards the hair's root) to `1` (towards the hair's tip).  A
    value of `0` results in a direction perpendicular to the hair.  The
    effect of this parameter is most noticeable with a small reflection
    size.

@inputs

nN:
    Normalized surface normal.

@outputs

f:
    The reflection BSDF.
