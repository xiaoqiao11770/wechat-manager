= Subnet Connector =

"""Represents an input or an output (or both) of the parent VOP subnet."""

The Subnet Connector node represents the input or an output (or both) of the
parent subnet in which it resides. When this node is created, the parent network
automatically creates an input (or output) connector that corresponds to the
node. The Subnet Connector node references the data incoming (or outgoing) 
on a wire connected to the subnetwork.

This is an alternative wokflow tool to creating inputs by wiring the subnet
input first and then referencing it in [Subnet Inputs VOP|Node:vop/subinput].
Or creating an output by wiring an input to the 
[Subnet Outputs VOP|Node:vop/suboutput]. The two workflows should not be
mixed, although Houdini tries to handle gracefully any arising conflicts.

Using Subnet Connector for inputs is equivalent of using 
[Parameter VOP|Node:vop/parameter] with Scope set to Subnet Connector, 
although the Parameter VOP also creates parameter UI on the parent subnetwork.
This workflow of creating subnetwork inputs is more efficient for authoring
digital asset subnetworks, where adding, editing, and removing asset inputs and
outputs can be performed right in the network, without the need to jump to
Operator Type Properties editor.

NOTE: 
    The ((RMB)) menu on any VOP node has an item __Create Subnet Outputs__
    that creates Subnet Connector nodes and configures them to represent 
    subnet outputs.


@parameters
    

Connector Kind:
    Specifies whether the node represents a subnet input, a subnet output, or
    both.

    Input:
        This connector node represents a subnet input.
    Output:
        This connector node represents a subnet output.
    Input and Output:
        This connector node represents a subnet input and output.

Name:
    The name of the subnet input (or output).

Label:
    The label of the subnet input (or output).

Type:
    Specifies the VEX data type of the subnet connector.

Default Values:
    Depending on the connector type selected, it represents the
    default value of the connector in the VEX code. 

Use This Node to Set Parameter Attributes:
    When several Subnet Connector VOPs have the same __Name__, only
    one of the nodes is used to control the attributes of the
    parameter. Houdini decides which node to use for this by
    searching all the nodes according to the user defined order,
    then traversing inside subnets. If none of them have this
    parameter turned on, the first one found is used to set the
    parameter attributes. If one or more do have this option turned
    on, the first one with this option is used, even if another node
    (with this option turned off) is found first.
    
@inputs

Subnet Output:
    The value assigned to the subnet output.
