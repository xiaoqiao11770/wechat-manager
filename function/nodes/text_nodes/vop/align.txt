"""Computes a matrix representing the rotation around the axes normal to two vectors by the angle which is between the two vectors."""

This operator computes a matrix representing the rotation around the axes normal to two vectors (their cross product), by the angle which is between the two vectors. The resulting matrix maps the first vector onto the second. If both vectors have the same direction, the result will be
an identity matrix. If the vectors are opposed, the rotation is undefined.

This can also output a quaternion representation of the transformation rather than matrix.
