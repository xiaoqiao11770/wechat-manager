= Density to Opacity =

"""Computes the opacity of a uniform volume given a density."""

This VOP converts volume density to opacity by evaluating Beer's law. 

TIP:
    You should connect `dPdz` in the surface context to the distance parameter.

@parameters

Signature:
    Controls whether to evaluate monochrome or rgb opacity.

Density:
    The volume's density.

Shadow Density Multiplier:
    A multiplier to adjust the density for shadow rays.

Distance:
    The length of volume to composite.
