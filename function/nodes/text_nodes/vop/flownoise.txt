"""Generates 1D and 3D Perlin Flow Noise from 3D and 4D data."""

This operator generates 1D and 3D Perlin Flow noise from 3D and 4D data.
There are two forms of Perlin flow noise: a non-periodic noise which changes
randomly throughout the N-dimensional space, and a periodic form which
repeats itself over a given range of the space. The periodic form can be
used to generate patterns which 'tile' over N-dimensional space (i.e. a
noise-based texture map which repeats seamlessly).

The noise has a range of (0, 1) with a median value of 0.5. The
distribution of the noise depends on the dimension, with higher
dimensions approaching a Gaussian distribution of noise values.

Flow noise is very similar to Perlin noise, as in
[Node:vop/periodicnoise], but with an extra flow parameter.  The flow
parameter can be thought of as an extra dimension, but a dimension
whose period is always 1.  Moving through the flow dimension rotates
the noise vectors rather than adjusts slices through a noise space;
however, so generates a more flowing appearance to the animation, and
hence the name.

This operator is just the building block noise, for higher levels
consult the [Node:vop/aaflownoise] which performs multiple iterations.
