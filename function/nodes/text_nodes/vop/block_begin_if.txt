= Block Begin If =

"""Marks the start of an if code block."""

The Block Begin If node begins a conditional block of code.  If the
first input evaluates to true, the corresponding End block's outputs
will correspond to the End block's inputs.  If it evaluates to false,
however, the inputs of the End block will be ignored, and instead
the corresponding inputs of the Begin block will pass directly to
the outputs of the End block.

NOTE:
    The block nodes are usually implicitly put down with the higher
    level For Loop, For-Each Loop, While Loop tools.


@parameters
    Paired Block:
	A path to the paired block forming a begin/end block pair.
	Both nodes must be in the same network.  Nodes wired between
	the pair are enclosed in a convex hull and are placed inside
	a code block.  Depending on the types of the begin and end
	blocks, different control flow can be done on the block.

    Number of Outputs:
	By default an output is generated for each input.  This allows
	the specification of extra outputs.  If no input wire is present,
	the value is assumed to be `0` and the type must be specified.

	The outputs of an End block are paired with the outputs of the
	Begin block.  If no names are present, the pairing is done in
	order.  If names are present, they are paired by name.
