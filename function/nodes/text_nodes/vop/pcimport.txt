= Point Cloud Import =

"""This node imports point data while inside a pciterate or pcunshaded loop."""

The pcimport VOP imports point information while inside a pciterate or
pcunshaded context.  The data returned by pcimport will correspond to the
current iteration point.  pcimport should only be used with a point cloud
iteration.  This node corresponds to the [Vex:pcimport] VEX function.

There are two special channel names you can import:

`point.number`:
    The number of the point being processed.

`point.distance`:
    The distance of the point being processed from the query point.
    This is only available when iterating over unshaded points.

@inputs

handle:
    The point cloud handle to be used for import.

channel:
    The channel to import.  You should select the data type for the channel
    using the Signature parameter.

@outputs

success:
    Returns 1 when the import was successful.

data:
    The data imported from the point cloud.
