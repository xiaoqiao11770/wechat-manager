"""Runs an external program to generate geometry at render time."""

In addition to the program to run to generate geometry, you can specify a second program to generate motion blurred geometry.

Before the program is run, the program string is scanned for the sub-string '%LOD'. All occurrences of this sub-string are replaced with the level of detail computed by mantra (a floating point number representing the screen space).

NOTE:
    This procedural requires a bounding box to be specified. When generating motion blurred geometry, the bounds must enclose the blurred geometry as well.

@parameters

=== Main ===

Program:
    The program to run to generate geometry.  For example, `myprogram.pl arg1 arg2 %LOD`.

Blur Program:
    The program to run in order to generate geometry at the end of the frame.  If no program is specified, only transformation motion blur will occur.
    
Shutter:
    Optionally, a shutter time can be specified when rendering motion blur.
    
=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
