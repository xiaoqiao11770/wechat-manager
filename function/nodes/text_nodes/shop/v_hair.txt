"""This shader implements a lighting model approximating hair-to-hair and hair-to-skin shadowing of a thin coat of fur."""

This shader implements a lighting model approximating hair-to-hair and hair-to-skin shadowing of a thin coat of fur.  The shader is intended for use on open polygon, NURBS, or Bezier curves.

Turning off the __Compute Shadows__ toggle will prevent shadows from being computed which can speed up render times significantly (depending on whether ray-traced shadows are being used).
