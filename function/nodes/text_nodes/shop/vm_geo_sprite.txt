"""Renders points as sprites, small textures that are always normal to the camera."""

NOTE:
    This procedural works best if no bounding box is specified in the interface.

@parameters

=== Main ===

Object:
    This is the object which contains the sprites to render.  If the option is turned off, then this object's geometry will be used.  If another object is specified, it must be output to mantra for this procedural to work.

Velocity Attribute:
    This is the name of the velocity attribute to be used for motion blur.  The attribute must exist as a point attribute.
    
FPS:    
    This specifies frames per second for motion blur.

Attributes:
    This pattern specifies which point attributes should be copied to the sprite.

=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
