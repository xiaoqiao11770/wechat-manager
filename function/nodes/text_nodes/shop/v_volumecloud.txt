""" This volume shader will shade volume objects as if they were fog.
The density value will be used as the thickness of the fog at each
point. """

When attached to volume geometry, this shader will shade each point as
if it were fog. The value of the volume geometry is used as a density
value.

A uniform scale can be applied to the effective density using the Fog
Density value. The Shadow Density is used when shadow rays are cast
through the fog, allowing for the fog to be more or less opaque in the
shadow pass.

Because the fog is sampled internally, default shadow shaders like Fast
Shadow that return inside/outside will result in aliasing. If shadows do
not need to cast on the fog, they can be turned off easily in this SHOP.
Otherwise, one should use deep shadow maps or another method of getting
soft shadows.
