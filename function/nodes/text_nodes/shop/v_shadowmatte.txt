= VEX Shadow Matte =

"""The shadowmatte shader generates an alpha image that stores
screen-space shadow information for later compositing."""

The shadowmatte shader will occlude geometry behind the surface being
rendered, however, the output image will have the alpha value specified.
This allows for compositing tricks. Where this surface is shadowed, the
alpha of the output image will contain additional alpha. When the
resulting image is composited over a background plate, the shadowed
regions will occlude the background plate, simulating shadows. When the
matte shader is hit by shadow rays, the shadow amount determines how
much of a shadow will be cast by the surface.

It is also possible to disable fog on the surface. This means that no
fog will show up on the surface.
