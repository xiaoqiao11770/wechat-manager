= Switch =

"""Switch shops based on a single expression."""

The Switch shop can be used to switch shops based on a single
expression. The input shops are numbered starting at 0. This can be
useful for switching shops based on render passes. For example, setting
the expression to something like:

{{{
#!exp
$RENDERPASS
}}}
would allow you to switch shops based on the _$RENDERPASS_ variable
(which would need to be set before rendering).

For finer control over switching between renderers, see the Select
shop.
