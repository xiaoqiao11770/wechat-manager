= Merge Co-Shader  =

"""Merge multiple co-shaders for output."""

RIB allows multiple co-shaders to be declared for a single object.
However, the output SHOP only allows a single SHOP of each type to be
collected.  The merge co-shader SHOP allows multiple co-shaders to be
collected so that they all appear in the RIB file.
