"""Simulates a reflective metallic surface."""

Simulates a reflective metallic surface.


@parameters
    Reflection Angle:
        If set soft reflections will be generated.
    Area Sample:
        Controls the quality of soft reflections.
    Environment Map:
        If specified, reflection rays which miss objects will pick up
        color from the environment map.
        
        See [how to create an environment/reflection map|/render/envmaps].
    Tint:
        Modulates the color of the environment map.
    Null Object:
        Used to define the space for the environment map. Typically,
        this should point to a null object which has no transform
        associated with it.
    Environment Blur:
        changes the filter width on the environment map evaluation.
