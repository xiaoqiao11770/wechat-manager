"""The clay shader uses the Oren-Nayar diffuse lighting model to
simulate very rough surfaces."""

The clay shader uses the Oren-Nayar diffuse lighting model to simulate
very rough surfaces. Unlike Lambertian shading, the surface roughness is
taken into account when computing illumination. There is no specular
lighting done in this shader.
