"""This shader will constant shade a surface."""

This shader will constant shade a surface. The opacity color indicates
what colors can be seen through the surface For example, an opacity of
{1,0,0} will cause green and blue light to be seen through the surface.

The alpha parameter determines the coverage in the final output image.

Hint: You can make a matte shader by specifying zero color full opacity,
but zero alpha
