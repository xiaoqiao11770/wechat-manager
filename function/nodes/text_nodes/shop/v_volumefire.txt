""" This volume shader will shade volume objects as if they were flame.
The density value will be used as a lookup into a color shading ramp,
provided it lies within a certain range.
"""

When attached to volume geometry, this shader will shade each point as
if it were a flame. The value of the volume geometry is used both as
density cut-off and as a lookup into a shading ramp.  If the density
is below the low value, it will be transparent.  If it is over the
high value and Hollow Interior is set, it will also be transparent.
Otherwise, the density will be the Flame Density value (possibly
multiplied by the alpha if a texture map is used)

If no texture map is specified, the low, mid, and high colors will be
used as the flame color for each of the specified density values.  If
a texture map is specified, its full width will be stretched into the
low to high value range and used.  An alpha on the texture map will
modulate the density accordingly.

The Shadow Density is used when shadow rays are cast
through the flame, allowing for the flame to be transparent in the
shadow pass.

Because the fog is sampled internally, default shadow shaders like Fast
Shadow that return inside/outside will result in aliasing. If shadows do
not need to cast on the fog, they can be turned off easily in this SHOP.
Otherwise, one should use deep shadow maps or another method of getting
soft shadows.

The Emission parameter causes the fire to add light to the ray without
affecting the opacity.  This allows the fire to blow out to white
rather than blending into an ugly salmon color.  Emission is
specified in amount per unit distance sampled, so large values may be
needed for small fires.
