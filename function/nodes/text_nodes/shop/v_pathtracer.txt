"""The pathtracer shader is used by PBR rendering."""

This shader is used by the PBR rendering engine to perform physically
based shading.  This is applied automatically when the PBR rendering
engine is chosen.

If you need different export variables, this shader can be used as a
starting point for a custom PBR rendering function.
