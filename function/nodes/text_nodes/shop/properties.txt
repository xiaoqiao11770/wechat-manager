= Properties =

"""Attach its properties to any objects that have the shader assigned."""

[Properties|/props] are rendering parameters you can add at various levels (renderer,
camera, object, primitive) that are inherited by lower levels.

Applying a [material|/shade/materials] with a Properties shader essentially copies any properties
on the shader to the target object. However, properties on each object override
properties on the object's shader.

Applying properties through a shader, rather than adding them directly to objects,
is useful in a few circumstances:

- In the Noise Displacement material,
  a Properties shader adds a Displacement Bounds
  property to the target object, and automatically sets it equal to the maximum
  amount of displacement set on its sibling displacement shader.
  
- If you had a material assigned to objects inside other objects, for example
  eyeballs inside a character, you could use a Properties shader in the material
  to give the target objects a custom light mask.
  
- The [Instance object|Node:obj/instance] lets you choose a Properties shader that
  will override any properties on the instanced geometry.

@parameters

When created, a Properties shader has no parameters. You
add properties to the shader node and those properties are then
applied to any objects or primitives that use the shader.

See [how to add properties to a node|/props/#edit].
