"""This fog shader computes the coverage based on an ease-in ease-out
curve between the near and far clipping planes."""

This fog shader computes the coverage based on an ease-in ease-out curve
between the near and far clipping planes. The inflection point of the
interpolant can be shifted by changing the rolloff value.
