"""The blur shadow shader generates soft shadows by sending out multiple
shadow rays."""

The blur shadow shader generates soft shadows by sending out multiple
shadow rays.

Filtered shadows evaluate the occluding objects surface to compute the
opacity. Thus, filtered shadows allow for transparent shadows. Fast
shadows assume that all occluding objects are opaque.

The shadow bias can be used to prevent self shadowing of a surface The
shadow intensity is a scale on the shadow intensity. Decreasing this
value to zero will result in no shadows. At one, the shadow will occlude
all light from the source.

The fog quality controls the oversampling when shadows are being
evaluated from within a volume (fog) shader. This is a scale on the
oversampling parameter.
