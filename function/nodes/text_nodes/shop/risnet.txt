"""Serves as a container for RIS shaders."""

This SHOP provides an area for creating RIS shader nodes. This SHOP is not a shader. It is a container for shaders to be used in the RenderMan RIS rendering mode. Since it is not a shader, it cannot be assigned to a geometry as a shader, but its children can.

RIS shaders are different from traditional RSL shaders, because they define a BxDF rather than a color. Some intermediate nodes may actually compute color, but the assignable RIS shader node will provide a BxDF.

RIS also allows shader layering by wiring outputs (export parameters) of one shader to inputs (parameters) of another. Such shader composition is similar to co-shaders. The co-shaders are not called explicitly in the main shader, but are invoked by the renderer and the results are passed in as main shader parameters.

Please see [RIS shaders|/shade/ris] for more information.
