"""Generates an iso-surface from a 3D texture image (.i3d) file."""

If you don't specify a bounding box for the procedural, the
bounding box of the texture map will be use.

@parameters

=== Main ===

I3D File:
    Specifies the file to render.

Density Channel:
    The name of the density channel.
    
Density Threshold:
    The density threshold at which to generate the iso-surface.

Level Of Detail:
    Specifies an alternate level of detail for the polygonization of the texture.

Filter:
    The filter to be used in evaluation of the texture.
    
Filter Width:
    The width of the filter.
    
=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
