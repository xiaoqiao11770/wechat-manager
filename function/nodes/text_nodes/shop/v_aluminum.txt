"""This surface implements anisotropic shading based on the lighting
model by Greg Ward."""

This surface implements anisotropic shading based on the lighting model
by Greg Ward which can be found at the Radiance Homepage (http:/
/radsite.lbl.gov).

If U & V roughness are equal, the specular highlite will be isotropic.
If they are different, the highlite will be anisotropic. Some values
are:
