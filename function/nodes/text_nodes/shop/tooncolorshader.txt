= Toon Color Shader =

"""Shades objects with a stylized cartoon look."""

== Overview ==

This shader works by dividing the model into three regions: highlights, lit areas, and unlit areas, and shading them with flat color. You can control the size and color of each area.

You will typically use this shader in combination with another copy or instance of the same object with the [Toon Outline Shader|Node:shop/toonoutlineshader].

== Tips ==

* This shader works with all light types, but it works best with non-area lights such as point and distant lights.

* For certain cartoon looks, you might want to turn off shadows. Select the [Icon:OBJ/light][Light|Node:obj/hlight] objects in the scene, and set __Shadow type__ to "No Shadows". (This will also speed up rendering.)

* With this shader, it's often convenient to set the color attribute on groups of primitives instead of painting textures. You can use the [Toon Shader Attributes geometry node|Node:sop/toonshaderattribs] to set the `colorhigh`, `colormid`, and `colorlow` attributes. These override the parameters below. It can also override Toon Outline Shader parameters such as outline width.

NOTE:
    The Toon Color Shader doesn't work in PBR mode.

@parameters

== Color ==

Use Cd:
    #id: Cdbias
    
    How much to use the model's color (`Cd`) attribute vs. the colors set below.

Use Light Color:
    #id: lightcolorbias
    
    How much to use the color of incoming light. `0` ignores the color completely while `1` makes full use of it.

Highlight Size:
    #id: highamount
    
    The size of highlight areas. The actual size depends on the brightness of the lights in your scene.

Highlight Color:
    #id: colorhigh
    
    The color for highlight areas.

Mid Amount:
    #id: midamount
    
    The size of lit areas. The actual size depends on the brightness of the lights in your scene.

Mid Color:
    #id: colormid
    
    The color for areas that are lit but not a highlight.

Shaded Color:
    #id: colorlow
    
    The color for unlit areas.
