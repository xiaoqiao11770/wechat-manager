"""Select which shop to use for rendering based on valid render types
and expressions."""

The Select shop allows you to select which shop to use for rendering
based on valid render types and expressions.

When using multiple renderers, the Select shop will choose the first
input which has a RenderMask which matches the target renderer. For
example, if the first input is a RenderManâ„¢ shader and the second is a
vex shader, then the first input will be used when generating rib and
the second will be used for vmantra.

Also, it is possible to animate which shop will be applied. This is
useful when rendering with multiple passes. An expression can be written
to switch inputs based on the render pass being executed.
