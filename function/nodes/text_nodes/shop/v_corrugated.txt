"""This displacement shader simulates corrugated material (like
cardboard or metal."""

This displacement shader simulates corrugated material (like cardboard
or metal.

Texture coordinates (or the surface parametric coordinates) are used.
This shader does not self anti-alias, so you may need to increase
shading quality to improve anti-aliasing. The squareness parameter
affects the shape of the corrugations
