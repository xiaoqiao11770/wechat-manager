The Subnet shop is essentially a way of creating a macro to represent a
collection of shops as a single shop in the Layout Area. The Subnet
shop can contain an entire shop Network within it, stream-lining and
simplifying your shop network both visually and conceptually.

Selecting Edit SubNetwork... from the shop's pop-up menu presents you
with a new Layout area with four subnetwork inputs. These four inputs
are connected directly to the four inputs on the Subnet shop in your
original network. Proceed by attaching shops as required to these four
subnetwork inputs. The display shop will be wired back to the output
connector of the Subnet shop in your original shop network. To get back
to the original shop network, select Quit... from the File menu.

See [subnetworks|/network/organize]  for a complete discussion and an
example of how to use subnetworks.


TIP:
    Select several Operators that you want to make into a subnetwork,
    and select Collapse Selected from the SHOP's pop-up menu to
    automatically create a subnetwork out of them. You will see the
    selected Operators replaced by a single Subnetwork SHOP, and it will
    be properly rewired to contain the previously selected shops.
