"""Shader offering standard set of bake outputs"""

This shader offers a standard set of outputs based on common baking workflows. For example, baking tangent-space normal maps from high-res to low-res objects.

@inputs

High Res Object:
    #id: highResObj
    Specifies the high-res object to bake shading from. If a high-res object is specified then a correspondence is found between points on the low-res object and the high-res object. Shading then occurs at the high-res object's surface. If a high-res object is not specified then shading will occur at the low-res object's surface.

Max Distance:
    #id: maxDistance
    Controls the maximum distance that rays traced against the high-res object will be considered. Useful for limiting the areas of the scene that will be baked onto the low-res object.

Samples:
    #id: samples
    Number of samples to use when sampling raytraced output types (eg. Occlusion, Cavity, Thickness). Increasing the number of samples will reduce noise in the shading.

Normal Space:
    #id: normalSpace
    Specifies the space that normals are output in. `0 to 1` unitizes the normal, which is useful for engines that require normalized textures. `-1 to 1` leaves the normals in their natural coordinate space.

Tangent Normal Flip X:
    #id tangentNormalFlipX
    Toggles flipping of the normal's X axis. Various packages may expect normal maps in different spaces. The flip parameters allow you to match these various spaces.

Tangent Normal Flip Y:
    #id tangentNormalFlipY
    Toggles flipping of the normal's Y axis. Various packages may expect normal maps in different spaces. The flip parameters allow you to match these various spaces.

Occlusion Bias:
    #id: occlusionBias
    This acts as a contrast control over the occlusion shading, with values higher and lower than `0.5` resulting in more and less contrast.

Cavity Distance:
    #id: cavityDistance
    Controls the distance within which features will influence the shading.

Cavity Bias:
    #id: cavityBias
    This acts as a contrast control over the cavity occlusion shading, with values higher and lower than `0.5` resulting in more and less contrast.
