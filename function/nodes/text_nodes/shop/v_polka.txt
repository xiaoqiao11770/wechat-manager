= VEX Polka Dots =

"""This shader generates polka dots."""

This shader generates polka dots. The shader does no self anti-aliasing,
meaning that you may have to increase the shading quality to reduce
aliasing.

The frequency and offset parameters control the noise space of the polka
dots.

If a rest position attribute is found, noise will be computed using that
attribute.
