"""Invokes Houdini Engine for each point on the object's geometry and instances
the geometry output by the script at that point."""

When Houdini Engine is run, it adds a single SOP of the specified type and then opparms each of the points attributes to that SOP.  For example, if the SOP is platonic, and the geometry had a point attribute type, which platonic solid is used will vary according to the point attribute.

If the bounding box is not specified for the procedural, the bounding box of this object's geometry, increased by the predicted instance sizes, will be used.

If the SOP to be included contains a SHOPNET with SHOPs that are used, a non-displayed version of the SOP should be in your scene file. You should also set the output driver to have the __SHOP References__ parameter set to __Declare all SHOPS__.

NOTE:
    The level of detail of the procedural will be opparmed to the parameter named lod. If there is an attribute named `lod`, it will override the innate level of detail calculated by mantra.


NOTE:
    Mantra must be invoked with the Engine option by adding -E to the command
    line.  This will cause Mantra to check out a Houdini Engine license for the
    duration of the render.

@parameters

=== Main ===

SOP:
    Name of the SOP type.  This is the name, not the label.  Examples: box, platonic, sphere.

OTL Files:
    Filenames with paths of OTL libraries that hscript should otload prior to creating the SOP.

Basic Size:
    If not overridden by the size attribute, this is used to know how big each hscript generated procedural will be. It gives the radius in each direction.

Size Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to use for the instance size. If a 3 float attribute, specifies the x,y,z radii. If a one float attribute, it is the uniform radius. This is multiplied by the basic size to guess the size of each instance.

Scale to Size Attribute:
    If turned on, it will rescale the generated geometry by the size in the size attribute. Only uniform scaling is currently supported.

Orient to Point:
    If turned on, it will try to orient to the points velocity, etc.  Even if not set, a translation to the point's space will be performed.

=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
