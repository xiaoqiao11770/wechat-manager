ASAD Light - All Singing And Dancing Light Shader This shader simulates
a point or cone light source. The light may be attenuated. If
attenuation is used, the attenuation parameter specifies the distance at
which the illumination is half the intensity at the light source origin.
If a diffuse or reflection map is specified, then no cone or attenuation
is done on the light. As well, only one of the diffuse or reflection
maps should be specified. If a slide projection image is specified, the
light will be projected through the view of the light source. Outside
the viewing frustum of the light, the light will be filtered by the
border color

The reflection map scale is implemented for backward compatibility only.
When using cubic reflection maps, this can yield incorrect results and
values should be left at 1.

Attenuation may be turned off, use half-intensity distance" or
physically accurate math. Half-intensity allows you to specify the
distance at which the light intensity will be one half the value given.
Physically accurate attenuation uses 1/(r*r) falloff to determine
intensity.
