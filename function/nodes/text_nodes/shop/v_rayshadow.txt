"""The rayshadow shader generates shadows based on one of four different
techniques."""

The rayshadow shader generates shadows based on one of four different
techniques.

Z-Depth shadows use a z-depth map (rendered from a light source). Deep
shadows generate a deep shadow map for a light source. Filtered shadows
evaluate the occluding objects surface to compute the opacity. Thus,
filtered shadows allow for transparent shadows. Fast shadows assume that
all occluding objects are opaque.

The shadow bias can be used to prevent self shadowing of a surface when
using depth map shadows.  The shadow intensity is a scale on the shadow
intensity. Decreasing this value to zero will result in no shadows. At one,
the shadow will occlude all light from the source.

Z-Depth softness makes the z-depth shadows softer.

Z-Depth quality improves the noise around penumbras.

Shadow map filter controls the filtering to be used for deep shadow
maps.

Mipmap interpolation controls whether shadow samples interpolate mipmap
levels for deep shadow maps. Setting this value to true can reduce seam
artifacts where the renderer switches from one mipmap level to another.
However, it can reduce performance as additional samples must be taken.

Depth interpolation controls the mode in which depth samples are
interpolated for deep shadow maps. Discrete interpolation should be used
for surface samples, while linear interpolation should be used for
volume samples.

NOTE:
    All z-depth parameters also apply to deep shadow maps.
