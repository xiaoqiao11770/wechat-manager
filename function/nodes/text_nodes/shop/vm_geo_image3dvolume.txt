"""Replaces object's geometry with a volume primitive read from a 3D texture (.i3d) file."""

Each channel within the texture will be bound to a corresponding vex shader parameter, if it exists.

This is much more efficient than having a large volume in the scene, since the image3D file can be streamed on demand.

If you don't specify the bounding box for the procedural, the
bounding box of the texture map will be used.

@parameters

=== Main ===

I3D File:
    Specifies the file to render.
    
=== IFD Bounds ===

Bounding Box:    
    The bounding box controls let you specify a bounding box for the referenced geometry. Only when this bounding box is "on screen" will mantra load the referenced geometry. You can set __Bounding box__ to __No bounding box required__, in which case mantra will always load the references geometry regardless. You can also specify the bounding box by referencing the SOP's bounding box in the __SOP Bounds__ parameter.
       
SOP Bounds:
    The geometry whose bounding box you want to reference.

Min Bounds:
    The minimum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.

Max Bounds:
    The maximum bounding box dimensions, when setting explicit bounds.
