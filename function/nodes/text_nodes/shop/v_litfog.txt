"""This fog shader computes lit fog by marching a ray from the eye to
the surface being shaded."""

This fog shader computes lit fog by marching a ray from the eye to the
surface being shaded. The illumination in the scene is computed at each
step along the ray. If shadows are turned on, this will cause shadow
shaders to be evaluated possibly increasing render times substantially.


@parameters

Fog Density:
    How thick the fog appears.

Fog Color:
    The color of the fog. If a projection map is used, this is multiplied by the map.

Max Steps:
    Limits the total number of steps in the volume, from entry to exit, to limit performance.

Step Size:
    Larger step sizes can be used to decrease quality and improve performance, and smaller step sizes should be used to increase quality. This parameter should be set based on the scale of your scene.

Do Shadows:
    Enables shadows.

Noise Frequency:
    Controls the size of the noise. Higher values are smaller.

Noise Offset:
    Offsets the noise to simulate movement of the noise.

Noise Amplitude:
    Strength of the noise.
    
Noise Roughness:
    Controls noise's rough or smooth appearance.

Noise Turbulence:
    This value controls the amount of details in the noise. This is the number of times the noise function is called and summed. If the __Noise Frequency__ is high, there is no need for much detail, 1 or 2 should be plenty. This can affect the __Noise Amplitude__ as well since the summing will result in higher base values.
