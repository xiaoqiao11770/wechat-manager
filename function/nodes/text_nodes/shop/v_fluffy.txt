"""This shader is used by the i3dgen program (or the 3D Texture output
driver) to generate a 3D texture map."""

This shader is used by the i3dgen program (or the 3D Texture output
driver) to generate a 3D texture map.

This shader will simply computes a density field representing a noisy
sphere.


@parameters
    Noise Frequency:
        How quickly the noise changes over space.
    Noise Offset:
        Translation of the noise.
    Cloud Time:
        Noise is computed using 4D noise. The cloud time provides the
        offset for the 4th dimension. This allows the noise to change
        smoothly over time.
    Noise Amplitude:
        Strength of the noise.
    Noise Roughness:
        Fractal lacunarity.
    Turbulence:
        Number of octaves of noise are computed.
    Cloud Radius:
        The size of the sphere.
    Fringing:
        The resulting density is determined by whether the sample point
        is inside or outside the noisy sphere. The fringing controls the
        softness of the edge of the noisy sphere.
