= Generic Bsdfshader =

"""Implements a generic bsdfshader shader."""

This SHOP implements a generic bsdfshader shader. It provides input fields for
every renderer supporting bsdfshader shaders. Bsdfshaders are different than
BSDF itself: they are shaders that define, build, and shape up the BSDF
function. The resulting BSDF function will depend on the shader arguments. 
The bsdfshader can be assigned to a surface or a volume, and the resulting BSDF
function will be used by the integrator to compute the final lighting.
