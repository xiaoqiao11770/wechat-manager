"""A fast volumetric light shader."""

A fast volumetric light shader. Uses a Zmap image from a light to
calculate shadows. Generally most useful when used in a fog object that
is the child of the light it is associated with.


@parameters
    Fog Color:
        #channels: /fogclrretc

        The color of the fog. If a projection map is used, this is
        multiplied by the map.
    Fog Density:
        #channels: /density

        How thick the fog appears
    Attenuation:
        #channels: /attenuation

        Falloff distance of the fog, from the source
    ZMap Image:
        Image used to calculate shadows. Must be a Zpic, and is usually
        generated from the parent light.
    Projection Map:
        An image to project 'through' the fog. Any colors in the image
        will streak through the fog.
    Sampling Quality:
        #channels: /quality

        Higher is slower but better.
    Sampling Spread:
        #channels: /spread

        Spacing of the sampling. Non-zero will essentially blur the Z or
        Proj maps.
    Focal:
        #channels: /focal

        Focal length of the projection. Should be the same as the focal
        length of the parent light.
    Aperture:
        #channels: /aperture

        Equivalent to Focal. Should follow parent light.
    Near Clipping:
        #channels: /near

        Near Clipping plane of projection.
    Far Clipping:
        #channels: /far

        Far Clipping plane of projection.
    Max Sample Steps:
        #channels: /maxsteps

        Maximum number of sample steps per ray. Essentially an upper
        limit to the __Sampling Quality__.
    Jitter:
        #channels: /jitter

        Jitters the samples to avoid 'banding' artifacts.
    Noise Type:
        Type of noise to be applied to the fog.
    Noise Amount:
        #channels: /noiseamount

        Essentially mixes in the noise. 0 is no noise.
    Noise Roughness:
        #channels: /noiserough

        Controls noise's rough or smooth appearance.
    Noise Attenuation:
        #channels: /noiseatten

        Controls falloff of the noise. Higher is less noise.
    Noise Frequency:
        #channels: /noisefreq

        Controls the size of the noise. Higher is smaller
    Noise Offset:
        Offsets the noise to simulate movement of the noise
    Noise Space:
        Normally World space. If set to __Fog space__, the noise will streak
        through the fog from the source and will move with 'with' the
        fog if animated.
    Fog in Shadow:
        Instead of 'normal' volumetrics will only put fog into shadow
        areas. Very cool!
