"""This is the UV rendering lens shader."""

This shader is responsible for initializing rays for UV rendering with raytracing.

@parameters

Ray P Offset:
        Determines how much to offset the position of the ray from the surface of the object along the normal vector. This value should be increased proportional to the displacement in a displacement shader (if there is one) in order to ensure that the ray hits the surface.

N Orientation:
        Lets you to specify if the geometry being unwrapped has outward-facing normals or inward-facing normals.
