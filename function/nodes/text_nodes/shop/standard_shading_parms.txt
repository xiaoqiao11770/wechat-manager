div id="vm_displacebound">>
    The maximum bounds that the displacement shader will move geometry. This is defined in "camera" space. The absolute value is used to determine the bounds.

div id="vm_truedisplace">>
    Whether to do "real" displacement (actually modify geometry at render time, allowing the silhouette of the object to change). If you turn this option off, the values of the displacement tab will be used as a bump map (creating the appearance of depth but not actually modifying the geometry or changing the object's silhouette).

div id="displacetype_bump">>
    A bump map creates the appearance of surface detail without actually modifying the geometry or changing the object's silhouette.

    Depending on the __Channel__ parameter the R, G, B channel or the luminance is used as the bump height.

div id="displacetype_normal">>
    Set the normals from an `RGB` texture. After reading the texture values, they are modified according to the __Normal Space__, __Flip X__ and __Flip Y__ parameters and transformed to the space defined by the __Vector Space__.

div id="displacetype_dispnormal">>
    Moves the surface in the direction of it's normal.

    Depending on the __Channel__ parameter the R, G, B channel or the luminance is used as the height.

div id="displacetype_dispvector">>
    Moves the surface by the texture value. The value is applied in the chosen __Vector Space__.
