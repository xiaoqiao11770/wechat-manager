= VEX Soft Toon =

"""This non-photorealistic shader shades the surface facing away from
the light, allowing detail to be seen in shadows."""

It also has a contrast
control which allows for a soft transition between full light and
shadow, creating a cartoon like effect.

The Soft Toon shader uses an unclamped cosine shader. This can be
thought of as a normal diffuse shader extended entirely around the
object rather than only on the lit side.

The contrast value controls the width of the shaded band. A high value
for the contrast creates a two-toned shader with a smooth transition
between the levels.

Because the dark side of the surface is shaded by default, it does not
make sense to cast shadows onto a surface shaded with this shader. As a
result, it does not do any shadow testing.
