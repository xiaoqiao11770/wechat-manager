"""This displacement shader simulates rough cloth like burlap Texture
coordinates are used."""

This displacement shader simulates rough cloth like burlap Texture
coordinates (or the surface parametric coordinates) are used. This
shader does not self anti-alias, so you may need to increase shading
quality to improve anti-aliasing.
