= VEX Matte =

"""Occludes geometry behind the surface being rendered."""

The matte shader will occlude geometry behind the surface being
rendered, however, the output image will have the alpha value specified.
This allows for compositing tricks. When the matte shader is hit by
shadow rays, the shadow amount determines how much of a shadow will be
cast by the surface.

It is also possible to disable fog on the surface. This means that no
fog will show up on the surface.
