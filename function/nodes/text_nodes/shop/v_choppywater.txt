"""This shader gives the appearance of choppy waves."""

This shader gives the appearance of choppy waves. The primary roughness
is used to determine the basic wave shape, while the secondary roughness
is used to determine the choppiness of the waves.

The noise will always move the waves along the direction of the normal.
The base level is used to give a base negative displacement (along the
normal). By default, the displacement bounds should be set
to half the wave height.
