= Construction Plane Editing =

"""The construction plane editing operation allows for interactive manipulation of the construction plane."""


* Click ((LMB)) anywhere on the construction plane and drag to move it along its plane. 

* Click ((RMB)) anywhere on the construction plane and drag to build a construction plane that is perpendicular to the current one.

* Hold ((Ctrl)) while dragging if you want to align the new plane to the axes of the original.

* ((Ctrl + RMB)) will present a menu that allows you to control many parameters of the construction plane, including control over the construction-plane elevation, alignment, size and position.

* Clicking ((LMB)) outside the construction plane allows you to orient it with other geometry. 

== Click-orienting ==

- Click ((LMB)) a single point outside the construction plane and then ((RMB)) to move its origin to that point.

- Click ((LMB)) on two points and ((RMB)) to align the edge of the construction plane with the two points.

- Click ((LMB)) on a single point and a normal, on three points, or on an edge and a point to align the construction plane with the plane specified by the selection.

- Click ((LMB)) on a normal to align the construction plane's normal to the selected normal without moving the construction plane.

- ((Alt + LMB)) on an edge to align construction plane's normal to that edge.

Do all of the above clicking with the ((MMB)) to orient the so-called "up vector", which determines the axis along which to translate geometry when ((Alt)) is held down in operations such as __Transform__ and __Edit__. By default, the height vector coincides with the plane normal and can be brought back to its default using the ((RMB)) menu.

The construction plane handle that is available from the ((RMB)) menu of the construction plane button below the viewport provides much of this functionality without having to enter the construction plane operation.

Click ((RMB)) over the construction plane any time during a Houdini session to bring up the construction plane menu regardless of what operation is current.
