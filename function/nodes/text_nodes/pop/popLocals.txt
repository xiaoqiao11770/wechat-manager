    Standard POP local variables

        The seconds a particle in the template has been alive.

        Point is dead.
    ITER:
        Processing iteration number.
    JUSTHIT:
        A collision for this particle was detected (for example, by the
        Collision POP) during the processing of this _timestep_ (that
        is, this iteration of the particle simulation). This variable is
        cleared at the beginning of each timestep. Note that the
        collision POP actually detects any collisions which would have
        occurred the during the previous frame.

        Total number of points in source group.
    NX NY NZ:
        Normal vector.
    PT:
        The point number of the currently processed point. The `PT` is not constant like `ID`; it changes based on the number of points.

        The rest position.
    SLIDING:
        The sliding state of the particle.
    SPRINGK:
        Elasticity of a point.

        Point position.
    U V:

    VX VY VZ:
        Velocity direction.
    WEIGHT:
        Point spline weight.

        occurred.
