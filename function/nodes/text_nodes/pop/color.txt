= Color =

"""Changes a particle's diffuse color and/or alpha."""

This operator lets you set the color and/or alpha of its input particles
by specifying the value directly, via a ramp file, or from a compositing
operator.

This operator will add the color (`Cd`) or alpha (`Alpha`) attributes to
particles if they do not exist already.

    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]


    == Color ==

        This tab controls whether and how to set the color of the input
        particles.

        :

            Pass:
                Do not modify the color.
            Param:
                Set the color to an RGB value.
            Ramp:
                Get the color from a ramp.
            COP:
                Get the color from a compositing operator (an image).

        == Color: Param ==

            Color:
                #channels: /diffr /diffg /diffb

                Color to set on the input particles.


        == Color: Ramp ==

            Lookup:
                #channels: /colorrampu

                Use the ramp editor to create a color ramp, then use
                this parameter to control which point along the ramp the particle gets its color from. You can keyframe this parameter or enter an expression.
                
                To remove a color ramp, ((LMB)) click a bar and drag it up.


        == Color: COP ==

            COP Path:
                Path of a COP to get color from.

            U:
                #channels: /colorcopu

                U Parameter to evaluate COP at.
            V:
                #channels: /colorcopv

                V Parameter to evaluate COP at.

    == Alpha ==

        This tab controls whether and how to set the alpha (opacity) of
        the input particles.

        :

            Pass:
                Do not modify the alpha.
            Param:
                Set the alpha to a value.
            Ramp:
                Get the alpha from a ramp.
            COP:
                Get the alpha from a compositing operator (an image).
            Speed:
                Set the alpha according to the particle's speed.

        == Alpha: Param ==

            Alpha:
                #channels: /alpha

                Alpha value to set on the input particles.


        == Alpha: Ramp ==

            Lookup:
                #channels: /alpharampu

                Use the ramp editor to create an alpha ramp, then use
                this parameter to control which point along the ramp the
                particle gets its alpha from. You can keyframe this
                parameter or enter an expression.


        == Alpha: COP ==

            COP Path:
                Path of a COP to get alpha from.

            U:
                #channels: /alphacopu

                U Parameter to evaluate COP at.
            V:
                #channels: /alphacopv

                V Parameter to evaluate COP at.

        == Alpha: Speed ==

            To set alpha by speed, enter the low speed (corresponding to
            alpha = 0) and high speed (corresponding to alpha = 1).

            Alpha 0 Speed:
                #channels: /alpha0speed

                Speed at which alpha is 0.

            Alpha 1 Speed:
                #channels: /alpha1speed

                Speed at which alpha is 1.
