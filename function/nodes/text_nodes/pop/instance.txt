= Instance =

"""Renders instanced geometry on a particle."""

This operator copies the [render flag|/nodes/pop]  output of a
referenced object onto the input particles at render time. However, this means that the object containing the particles must have a point instancing render property applied otherwise your particles will either not render as spheres or not at all. The shelf tool adds this property automatically.

NOTE:
    The geometry only appears when in [mantra|Node:out/ifd] or [RenderMan|Node:out/rib] renders. The
    instanced geometry does not appear in the viewport. However, when
    the  [template flag|/nodes/pop]  is on the node displays the
    instanced geometry as guide geometry.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `instance`.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Particle Geo:
        Object to display on the input particles.

        The object will be instanced on each of the particles in the
        system. Instancing does not consume additional memory for each
        copy.

        The particle's frame of reference controls how the instanced
        geometry will be oriented on the particle. The axis is
        determined by the particle's up vector (Up Vector POP) and
        applied rotation (Rotation POP).

    Orientation:
        Method for specifying orientation of instanced geometry.


        Particle axes (vel and up vector):
            If there is no applied rotation, the object's Z axis is
            oriented along the particle's velocity, and its Y axis is
            aligned with the up vector. This is useful when the geometry
            should always face the direction the particle is
            traveling.

        Fixed axis:
            Aligns the geometry along a fixed axis. This is useful when
            performing collisions. For example, if a particle bounces
            off a surface, the object's orientation should remain the
            same and shouldn't flip around because the velocity
            changed.

    Angle:
        When __Orientation__ is "Fixed Axis", the rotation angle of the
        geometry.

    Axis:
        When __Orientation__ is "Fixed Axis", the axis around which the
        geometry should be rotated.

    Clear Orientation Attribute:
        When __Orientation__ is "Particle Axes (vel and up vector)", controls
        whether any already existing "orient" attribute is cleared (zeroed).
