= Null =

"""Passes inputs through unaffected."""

This operator is useful to provide a fixed reference point for other
operators to refer to.

For example, a [Icon:POP/fetch][Fetch POP|Node:pop/fetch] in another network may need to import particles. Instead of referring the Fetch POP to the actual node with
the particles you want, connect that node to a Null POP and refer the
Fetch POP to the Null node. This lets you modify how the rest of the particle network works, adding and removing nodes, without worrying about breaking or having to update the reference in the [Fetch POP|Node:pop/fetch].
