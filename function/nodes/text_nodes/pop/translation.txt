= Translation =

"""Moves the particle frame of reference, offsetting instanced geometry
from the particle position."""

The particle's velocity and up vector define the frame of reference on
the particle. This operator offsets the frame of reference and any
geometry instanced on the particle.

The translation is evaluated either in component form or as a vector.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `trans`.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Apply Motion:

        To all points:
            Translate all input particles.
        To moving points:
            Only translate particles with velocity greater than 0.
    Translation:
        #channels: /transx /transy /transz

        Distance to move the frame of reference.
