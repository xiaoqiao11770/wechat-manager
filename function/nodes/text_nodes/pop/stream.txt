= Stream =

"""Emit particles from areas where streams of particles mix."""

This operator divides space into equal-sized partitions, and then emits particles from any partition where the density of particles from one or more streams is above a per-stream threshold. This can be used, for example, to generate sparks where two particle beams cross.

Smaller values for the __Division Size__ parameter gives more partitions
and a higher resolution; however, it also increases cooking time. Keep in
mind that if you decrease the size of the partitions, you probably also
want to decrease the thresholds.


@parameters
    Activation:
        #channels: /activate

        Turns this node on and off. A value of 0 means off, any other
        value means on. This is useful to control the effect of this
        node with an  [expression|/expressions] .


    == Source ==

        Birth Position:
            #channels: /birthpositionx /birthpositiony /birthpositionz

            Where in the partition to emit new particles when the
            density is above the threshold.

        Division Size:
            #channels: /sizex /sizey /sizez

            Size of the partitions.

        Offset of Grid:
            #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

            Distance to offset the partition grid from the default.


        == Enable ==

            Enable Stream <<n>>:
                Use stream <<n>>.


        == Group ==

            Group <<n>>:
                Subset of the input particles to use as stream <<n>>.


        == Threshold ==

            Threshold <<n>>:
                #channels: /threshold<n>

                Number of stream <n> particles required in a partition
                to emit a new particle.


        == Kill ==

            Kill original particle <<n>>:
                When a new particle is emitted, kill the source
                particles from this stream in the partition.

    == Birth ==

        Birth Probability:
            #channels: /probmin /probmax

            How many particles to emit in each partition.

        [Include:commonParms#birthParms/]

    == Attributes ==

        [Include:commonParms#inheritVeloParms/]

        [Include:commonParms#veloAttrParms/]

        Origin Index:
            #channels: /originindex

            Value for the origin attribute.

@locals
    DENSITY:
        Total number of particles from enabled streams contained in the
        partition.
    THRESH:
        Sum of all enabled stream thresholds.
    TIMEINC:
        Time increment for this cook.
    TX, TY, TZ:
        Birth Position.
