= Resistance =

"""Calculates air or water resistance on instanced geometry."""

This operator simulates the effect of wind or water resistance on the
geometry [instanced on particles|/particles/instancing_rendering] . The resistance
may push or rotate the instanced object.

The resistance is calculated on instanced geometry. If no geometry is
instanced, this operator will not alter the particle.

The orientation of the geometry with respect to its direction of travel
will often determine how much resistance is applied.

The instanced geometry should not be very complicated. Complex geometry
will result in slower cook times with only marginally better results.
Use a simplified representation of the real render geometry.

This operator modifies the acceleration and torque attributes of a
particle.


@parameters

    == Resistance ==

        Resistance:
            The resistive factor of the medium against _linear_
            movement. Higher values produce more viscous (resistant)
            media.

        Rotational:
            The resistive factor or the medium against _rotational_
            motion. Higher values produce more viscous (resistant)
            media.

            This value is normally the same as the __Resistance__
            parameter. You can increase this value if you find your
            particle is either too tipsy, or decrease this value if the
            particle is too rigid.

        Model:
            Uses either Viscous or Newtonian model for evaluating
            resistance.

            <!--
            Viscous (linear):
                TBD.
            Newtonian (quadratic):
                TBD.
            -->
        Modify:

            Position and orientation:
                This operator affects both the position and rotation of
                the input particles.
            Position only:
                This operator only the position of the input particles.
            Orientation only:
                This operator only the rotation of the input particles.
        Ray Count:
            This operator works by casting out a certain number of rays
            and seeing if they hit geometry. Geometry is only affected
            by the resistance if it gets hit by a ray. The higher the
            density of rays, the more accurate the simulation.

            For geometry with fine details (like holes or thin spines),
            use more rays (300 or more) to make sure the geometry is
            hit.


    == Turbulence ==

        Wind Current:
            A vector describing the wind direction. The direction of the
            vector controls the direction of the wind, and the length of
            the vector controls the intensity of the wind.

            For example, a value of (0, 1, 0) would create wind
            traveling straight down. A value of (0, 2, 0) would
            represent wind traveling in the same direction but twice as
            strong.

        Add Wind Noise:
            You can add noise to the wind, and have it change the wind
            direction, wind force, or both.


            None:
                Do not add noise to the wind.
            To wind magnitude only:
                Add noise to the wind strength, so the force of the wind
                varies but the direction stays constant.
            To wind direction only:
                Add noise to the wind direction, so the direction varies
                but the strength stays constant.
            To wind vector:
                Add noise to both the wind direction and strength.

    == Geometry ==

        Object Type:
            Set this option to "Solid" if your object is closed (no
            holes or openings), otherwise set it to "Hollow".


            Hollow object (2D):
                The instanced geometry is open (that is, it is flat, or
                has holes, or openings).
            Solid object (3D):
                The instanced geometry is closed (no holes or
                openings).
        Divisions:
            The resistance POP needs to determine the volume
            distribution of the geometry for moment of inertia
            calculations. The volume is determined by dividing the space
            the geometry occupies into voxels. This parameter controls
            how many voxels per axis the operator uses.

            The three values of this parameter are multiplied together.
            _Do not use values higher than 50_.

        Object Scale:
            Scales the geometry up or down during resistance
            calculations. Larger objects are more affected by resistance
            than smaller ones (with the same mass).

        Override Mass:
            Replaces any  [mass attributes|/particles/forces#props]  on the
            input particles with the value of the __Mass__ parameter
            below.

        Mass:
            #channels: /mass

            Mass to use when __Override mass__ is on.

        Override Center Of Mass:
            Normally, an object's center of mass is at its origin
            (0,0,0). Use this parameter to manually set the center of
            mass for the instanced object.
