= Creep =

"""Causes particles to stick to geometry."""

This operator forces the input particles to stay on a surface. It also
lets you control the U/V position of the particles on the surface to
make them creep across the surface. It allows you to set the position of the particles explicitly at every frame using the U/V position.

This operator affects the following attributes: `pstate` (uniform scale), `posprim` (number of the primitive to stick to within the referenced SOP), and `posuv` (U/V position of particle on the primitive).

    Behavior:
        How the input particles behave on the surface.


        Stick:
            Particles stay at the UV coordinates specified below.
        Slide:
            Particles slide along the surface as they are affected by
            forces.
    Stuck:
        #channels: /stuck

        If this value is 1 (or greater than one), a particle that would
        otherwise slide will be stuck. Use an expression here to decide
        which particles are stuck to the surface.

    Geometry Source:
        Specifies the SOP to stick to.


        Use parameter values:
            Use the SOP specified in the __SOP__ parameter below.
        Use first context geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the POP network's first input.
        Use second context geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the POP network's second input.
        Use third context geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the POP network's third input.
        Use fourth context geometry:
            Use the SOP connected to the POP network's fourth input.
    SOP:
        Path to the SOP to stick to (when __Geometry Source__ is set to
        __Use parameter values__).

    Prim Number:
        #channels: /posprim

        The number of the primitive to stick to within the referenced
        SOP.

    Prim U/V:
        #channels: /posuv1 /posuv2

        U/V position of particle on the primitive.
