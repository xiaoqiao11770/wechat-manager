Cook:
    At the top-level of the POP network, controls which POP is
    cooked. All required ancestors of the cooked POP are also
    cooked. In  [subnets|/network/organize] , controls which POP is the
    output of the subnet. Violet means on.
Template:
    Show  [guide geometry|/particles/visualize]  specific to the node. For
    example, turning on the template flag for a force node shows the
    direction of the force being applied to the particles. See
    [visualize node effects with template geometry|/particles/visualize]
    .
Bypass:
    Pass the input straight through to the output without modifying
    it. When the bypass flag is on, the node has no effect.
