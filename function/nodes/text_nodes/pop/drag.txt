= Drag =

"""Applies drag to the velocity of particles."""

This operator applies drag against a particle's velocity. The resistance
is proportional to the particle's speed and the value of its `drag`
attribute, which represents the particles _drag coefficient_, or how
"unaerodynamic" the particle is.

For particles born with some velocity (such as from a [Location
POP|Node:pop/location]), in the absence of other forces, end of
lifespan, etc., the particle will basically maintain the same velocity
forever. Drag acts like wind resistance or friction in the real world,
slowing down particles over time until they eventually stop.

You can apply drag to the linear velocity and/or the angular velocity of
the input particles.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Apply to Linear Velocity:
        Apply the drag to the linear velocity of the particles.
    Apply to Angular Velocity:
        Apply the drag to the angular velocity of the particles.
    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Scaling factor for the effect of the drag.

    [Include:commonParms#massParms/]

    Override Drag:
        Use the value of the __Drag__ parameter below instead of any
        drag attributes on the input particles.

    Drag:
        #channels: /drag

        Drag to use when __Override drag__ is on.
