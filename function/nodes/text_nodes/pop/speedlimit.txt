= Speed Limit =

"""Enforces minimum and maximum velocities."""

You can use this operator to set a minimum velocity for the input
particles, and/or a maximum velocity. Each particle can have its own set
of imposed limits.

NOTE:
    This operator only sets the `speedlimit` attributes on the particle.
    The limits are not actually imposed until the particle is moved
    during post frame processing of its default velocity rule (see the
    [Suppress Rule POP|Node:pop/suppress]).

This operator modifies the following attributes: `speedlimit`. It will
add the `speedlimit` attribute if it does not exist already.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    SpeedLimit:
        #channels: /speedlimitmin /speedlimitmax

        The value on the left is the minimum speed. The value on the
        right is the maximum speed.

        Use a negative value to turn off a limit.
