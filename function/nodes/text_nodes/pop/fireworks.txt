= Fireworks =

"""Creates a simple fireworks system."""

Besides being useful if you actually have a need for a simple fireworks
simulation, this provides a quick way to see something pretty, and can
be useful as a source for testing a particle chain.

NOTE:
    The fireworks start bursting around 60 or 70 frames into the
    animation. If your animation is shorter than that, you won't see the
    explosions.
