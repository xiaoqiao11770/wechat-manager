= Render =

"""Controls how particles render."""

The parameters of this operator control how the [renderer|/rendering]
draws particles.

NOTE:
    These settings can only affect all particles equally. The usual
    particle-specific local variables do not make sense in this operator
    and are not available.


TIP:
    To change particle size for individual particles, use the [Property
    POP|Node:pop/property] to set the particle's scale (`pscale`)
    attribute.

@parameters
    Activation:
        #channels: /activate

        Turns the POP on and off.

    Particle Type:
        How the particles are rendered.

        If you are outputting to RenderMan, use Disk for RiPoint and
        Line for RiCurve.


        Spheres:
            Render particles as spheres.
        Disks:
            Render particles as flat discs oriented toward the camera.
        Lines:
            Render particles as lines between their previous and current
            positions. This is similar to how particles appear in the 3D
            viewport.
        Tubes:
            Render particles as open tubes between their previous and
            current positions.
        Capped:
            Render particles as capped tubes between their previous and
            current positions.
        Rounded:
            Render particles as round-capped tubes between their
            previous and current positions.
    Particle Size:
        #channels: /prsize

        Sets the size of rendered particles. To change particle size for
        individual particles, use the [Property POP|Node:pop/property]
        to set the particle's scale (`pscale`) attribute.

    Particle Blur:
        #channels: /prblur

        How long the particles will appear when rendered. For end to end
        connectivity, set this to `1/$FPS`. To stretch particles
        increase this value, or to squash them decrease it.
