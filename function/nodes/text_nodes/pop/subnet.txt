= Subnetwork =

"""Encapsulates the functionality of a POP network inside a node."""

Subnetworks help simplify your networks visually
and conceptually.

See [how to create and work with subnets|/network/organize].

Inside the subnetwork, the layout view shows four pseudo-nodes, which
represent the subnet's inputs. Connect the output of the pseudo-nodes to
the inputs of the real nodes in the subnet to connect the subnetwork
node's inputs to the contained network.

Set the [cook flag|/nodes/pop] of the node you want to provide
the subnet's output.

TIP:
    You can nest subnetworks inside subnetworks.
