= Fetch =

"""Imports particle streams from other networks."""

This operator lets you import particle primitives from other networks
and merge them into the current stream.


@parameters
    Transform Object:
        The object to transform the imported streams relative to.

        * If you leave the field blank, no transformation is done and
          objects are imported in their own space.

        * If you specify "." (or the object which contains this
          operator), all merged primitives will be properly transformed
          into this object's space. Using "." aligns the fetched copy of
          the particle stream to its original in world space.

        * If you specify a POP node, the object which owns that node
          will be used.

    Align Events in World Space:
        Events such as births and collisions of fetched copies will
        occur in the same world locations as for the original stream.
        However, the directional attributes such as velocity will not
        automatically be aligned (to achieve that, set __Transform
        Object__ to ".").

    Number of POPs:
        Set this to the number of particle primitives you want to
        import. The parameter editor will show this number of fields for
        you to specify POP nodes to import.

    Enable Fetch #:
        Turn this off to disable import of a POP node/network.

    POP #:
        The path of a POP node or POP network to merge. If you specify a
        POP network is specified, the node with the  [cook
        flag|/nodes/pop]  set will be imported. A blank path is
        ignored.
