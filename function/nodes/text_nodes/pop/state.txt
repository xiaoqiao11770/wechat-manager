= State =

"""Sets the state information of particles."""

This operator modifies the following attributes: `pstate`.

NOTE:
    Most POPs will not process particles with non-zero states, as it
    would, for example, be inefficient to process dead particles.

The flags set by this operator are stored collectively as bits of a
single attribute (pstate). However, you can access them easily using
individual local variables such as `$JUSTHIT` and `$DEAD` (see the local
variables page). See the page on [inspecting
attributes|/ref/panes/geosheet]  for information on interpreting the
`pstate` attribute.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Click the checkbox next to an attribute to set that attribute on the
    input particles. If the checkbox is off, the node simply passes
    through the attribute if it exists.

    A non-zero value in the text field turns that state flag on. Use an
    expression in the text field to turn the flag on conditionally. For
    example, you could put `$VX > 10` in the __Dead__ field to kill any
    particles whose velocity in X is greater than 10.

    Dead:
        #channels: /dead

        Particle is dead.

    Stopped:
        #channels: /stopped

        Particle is stopped.

    Stuck:
        #channels: /stuck

        Particle is stuck.

    Sliding:
        #channels: /sliding

        Particle is sliding.

    Just Hit:
        #channels: /justhit

        Particle has collided in this timestep.
