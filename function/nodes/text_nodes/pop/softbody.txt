= Soft Body =

"""Performs soft body deformations similar to the Spring SOP."""

The Softbody POP performs soft body deformations similar to the [Icon:SOP/spring][Spring
SOP|Node:sop/spring]. The edges of the geometry act as "springs", which pull the
points back toward their original shape.

When this operator is first activated, the geometry at that time is used.
If the SOP changes thereafter, those changes will not be reflected in
the geometry produced by the POP network.

The POP creates a new particle system that will move the points of the
geometry. To make this particle system invisible to the scene, enable
the __Hide Particle System__ parameter. In the info pop-up, the particle
system will be denoted as "virtual".

For more stable behavior, see the [Icon:DOP/squishyobject][Squishy Object|Node:dop/squishyobject] in DOPs.

@parameters
    Activation:
        #channels: /activate

        Turns the POP on and off.

    == Source ==

        [Include:commonParms#geoSourceParms/]

        Fixed Points:
            Points to be considered stationary.

        Fixed Points go to Source Positions:
            Fixed Points are put to their positions in the Source.

        Copy Groups from Source:
            All Source groups are copied at each frame. Useful if the
            Fixed Points group contents are animated.

        Hide particle system:
            Make the particle system that controls the softbody
            deformation hidden (i.e. does not show in scene).


    == Spring ==

        Spring Behavior:
            How the springs will behave.


            Hooke's Law:
                Use Hooke's law. Force = displacement x spring
                constant.
            Normalize Displacement:
                Like Hooke's law except displacement is normalized to
                the original length of the spring. (Behavior used in
                Houdini 2.5).
            No Springs:
                No springs will be used.
        Spring Constant:
            #channels: /springk

            Stiffness of the spring.

        Initial Tension:
            #channels: /tension

            Initial spring tension before deformations.


    == Attributes ==

        Create Local Variables:
            Create local variables corresponding to inherited
            attributes.

        Add ID Attributes:
            Add ID and parent attributes.

        Add Generation Attribute:
            Add generation attribute.

        Add Origin Attribute:
            Add origin attribute.

        Use as Origin:
            How to set the origin.

        Origin Index:
            #channels: /originindex

            Index as used in origin.

        Add Speed Attribute:
            Add speed attribute (length of velocity vector).
