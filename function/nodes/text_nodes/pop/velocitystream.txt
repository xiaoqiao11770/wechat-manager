= Velocity Stream =

"""Emits a stream of evenly-spaced particles from geometry."""

This POP emits particles from the points of its Geometry Source.  However,
unlike the [Source POP|Node:pop/source], this POP does not make use of birth rate parameters.
Instead, it determines when to emit particles based on the velocity of
emitted particles.  The timing of emission is controlled in order to maintain
a specified spacing between particles in the emitted stream.  Currently, this
POP is used for emission of fluid particles in the [Particle Fluid Emitter DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidemitter].

TIP:
    To set particle attributes on the points of the emitter geometry (so
    the emitted particles inherit them at birth), connect a [Point
    SOP|Node:sop/point] to the emitter SOP and use the attributes on the
    __Particle__ and __Force__ tabs.


NOTE:
    A POP automatically adapts to the sop-space of the object it is
    cooking from, just as if it had a built-in [Object Merge SOP|Node:sop/merge]. To
    over-ride this behavior, turn on the __Ignore Transform Object__
    parameter.

NOTE:
    A detail attribute is added to record the last emission time.  The name is
    the full path to this node, so will not interfere with other velocitystream
    nodes.  However, if the same GDP will be reused for another simulation
    starting at another time, this detail attribute should be deleted with an
    [Attribute SOP|Node:sop/attribute].


@parameters

    == Source ==

        [Include:commonParms#geoSourceParms/]

        Source Group:
            Subset of all points/primitives in the source geometry to
            emit from.


    == Birth ==

        Stream Activation:
            Enables/disables particle emission from this node.

        Stream Spacing:
            Controls the spacing between particles in the emitted stream.
            This is done by regulating the times at which particles are
            emitted.  For example, if the velocity of emitted particles
            is set to 1 in the x direction, and the Stream Spacing
            parameter is set to 1, then particles will be emitted from
            each point in the Geometry Source every 1 second in order
            to maintain the desired spacing.

        Stream Acceleration:
            This parameter does not affect the behavior of particles once
            they are emitted, but rather affects the timing and direction
            of particle emission.  It is used to regulate the timing of
            particle emission in the presence of external forces accelerating
            the particles.  For example, if particles are emitted with no
            velocity, but are immediately affected by a downward gravity
            force, then the acceleration caused by that force could be
            specified here.

        Stream Velocity Scale:
            This parameter is a multiplier which controls the velocity used
            to determine the timing of particle emissions.  It does not
            affect the actual velocity of emitted particles, but rather
            can be used to internally scale the emission velocity to thicken
            or thin out the emitted particle stream.

        [Include:commonParms#birthParms/]

        Accurate Births:
            Recook source geometry before emission of each particle.

            This ensures particles are emitted from the correct location
            when the source geometry is animated. If the shape of the
            source geometry does not change, you should turn this option
            off.


    == Attributes ==

        Inherit Attributes:
            A list of names/patterns of attributes to inherit from the
            source geometry.

        Create Local Variables:
            Create local variables corresponding to inherited
            attributes.

    == Add Attributes ==

        The parameters on this tab let you control which and how
        attributes are initialized on
        the emitted particles. See the POP locals page for explanations
        of these variables.
