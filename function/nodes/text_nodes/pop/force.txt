= Force =

"""Applies a global directional force, such as gravity."""

An increase in _mass_ impedes acceleration for a given constant force.

_Drag_ is a force opposing the direction of motion. Drag is velocity
sensitive: the larger the velocity, the greater the effect of drag. It's
useful for limiting the velocity of particles.

This POP is similar to with wind force; however it does not accelerate particles to a maximum speed. The Force POP applies a constant directional force.

TIP:
    Use the [Property POP|Node:pop/property] to set "physical"
    attributes of particles such as mass and drag.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`.

See the [Wind POP|Node:pop/wind] for different kind of directional force
you can apply separately or in combination with this operator.

    == Force ==

        Reference Object:
            Path of an object from whose transform to extract the force
            direction.  Overrides the __Force__ parameter below.

        Force:
            #channels: /forcex /forcey /forcez

            Strength of the force along each axis.
        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Scaling factor for the force.

        [Include:commonParms#massParms/]


    == Noise ==

        The parameters on this tab add randomness to the force. This
        makes particles more or less affected at random, creating a less
        uniform effect.
