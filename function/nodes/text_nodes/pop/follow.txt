= Follow =

"""Makes particles follow a leader."""

This operator calculates and applies forces necessary to make particles
chase a leader.

You can use the second input to specify the leader(s), or use the
parameters on the __Leader__ tab to choose a group in the first input as
the leader(s).

NOTE:
	The Follow POP merges the particle streams from the first and second input.

The __Leader__ parameter on the __Leader__ tab let you choose how the
leader works:

* The "leader" can be a computed point based on the leader particles
  (the spatial center of the leader particles, the center of mass, or
  the center of density).

* Each particle in the leader stream can lead individual particles from
  the follower stream. Houdini can automatically assign followers to
  leaders, or you can set a `follow` attribute on particles to determine
  which leader they will follow. Use the [Property
  POP|Node:pop/property] to set the follow-related attributes on
  particles.
  
This force is similar to the [Attractor POP|Node:pop/attractor]. This tool should be used when you want to attract particles to a moving object, whereas the attractor tool should be used when you want to attract particles to a static object.

    == Follow ==

        Behavior:
            Controls how the node affects the follower particles.


            Normal Follow:
                For particles of unit mass, the velocity for the next
                frame will be towards the specified position with a
                speed equal to that of the leader.
            Accelerating Follow:
                Applies unit force towards the leader. This will cause
                the particle speed to continually increase if the leader
                does not turn.
        Minimum Distance:
            #channels: /mindistance

            Stop particles closer than this distance to the leader.

        Maximum Distance:
            #channels: /maxdistance

            If you enter a value greater than 0, particles further than
            this distance from the leader will NOT follow.

        Ambient Speed:
            #channels: /ambspeed

            If the speed of the leader falls below this value, this is
            used as the target speed instead.

        Attract Distance:
            #channels: /attdistance

            If the distance to the leader is less than this value, the force is repulsive. Otherwise, it is attractive. To make this parameter available, you must set the __Behavior__ to __Accelerating Follow__.

        Predict Intercept:
            Particles will try to predict the leader's direction on the
            next frame and head it off.

        Stop At Leader:
            Particles come to a complete stop when they reach the
            leader.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Scaling factor for the force applied to the particles.

        Speed Scale:
            #channels: /sscale

            Scaling factor for the target speed.


    == Leader ==

        Leader Group:
            Subset of points from the first input to act as leaders. You
            can use this parameter instead of connecting the second
            (Leader) input.

        Leader:
            Specifies what the particles follow.


            Particle Spatial Center:
                The center of the box bounding the leader particles.
            Particle Center of Mass:
                The center of mass of the leader particles.
            Particle Density Center:
                The center of mass of the leader particles, with all
                particles having equal mass.
            Individual Particles:
                Each following particle follows a leader particle. If
                you have `follow`
                attributes on the
                follower particles, they will use the attribute to
                decide which leader to follow (using the __Follow
                index__ parameter below). Otherwise, Houdini will
                automatically assign followers to leaders.
        Follow Index:
            This parameter is available when __Leader__ is "Individual Particles". It controls how the node interprets the `follow`
            attribute on particles to assign followers to leaders.

            Particles that do not have `follow` attributes are assigned
            to leaders automatically, using particle order to refer to a
            leader.


            Particle ID:
                The `follow` attribute on the follower particles refers
                to the particle ID of the leader they should follow.
            Particle Order:
                The `follow` attribute on the follower particles refers
                to the position of the leader particle in the list of
                particles. In a particle system where leader particles
                are dying and points are being reused, this could mean
                the leaders change as particles die (even if they are
                not in the leader stream).

    == Defaults ==

@inputs
    Follow:
        The particles that will be made to follow the leader.
    Leader:
        The particles that define the leader(s) to chase. If you do not
        connect this input, you must set the __Leader Group__ parameter
        on the __Leader__ tab.
