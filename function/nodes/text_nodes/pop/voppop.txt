= VOP POP =

"""Contains a VOP network that can manipulate particle attributes."""

This node contains a [VOP network|/nodes/vop] (double-click the node
in the network editor to go inside it) which can use POP context VOPs
to to manipulate attributes on particles. (To define a SOP using a
(textual) VEX program instead of a VOP network, use the
[VEX POP|Node:pop/vex] instead.)

NOTE:
    If there are no particles, the network will not run.

NOTE:
    This node is useful for creating "one-off" programs to manipulate
    particles in a single particle network. To use a VOP network to
    define a _reusable_ particle node type, see
    [creating a VEX particle node type|/vex/sopnodes].

@parameters

Activation:
    When this parameter is non-zero, the VOP network inside is run on the
    incoming particles. This parameter allows you to keyframe application
    of the contained VOP network on and off.
    
Cache incoming geometry:
    Makes a copy of the incoming particle geometry before running the
    contained VOP network on it so VOPs that query attributes on the
    input geometry are guaranteed to get the original incoming values.
    
    When this option is off, the node runs faster, but since the contained
    VOP network modifies the input geometry as it goes, it's possible
    that some VOPs will get the _modified_ value (if the particle has
    already been affected) rather than the original incoming values.
    
Source group:
    If you enter the name of a point group in the first input geometry in
    this parameter, only the points in that group will be affected by
    the VOP network.
    
Number of threads:
    The number of separate threads to use to evaluate the points.
    The default is no threading.

    Since Houdini evaluates the VOP network for each particle in the input
    geometry, it can benefit greatly from threading on a multi-processor
    or multi-core machine.
