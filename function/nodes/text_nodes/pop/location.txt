= Location =

"""Emits particles at a location in space."""

== Overview ==

While the [Icon:POP/source][Source POP|Node:pop/source] emits particles from existing
geometry, the Location POP simply emits particles from a 3D coordinate.

If you're looking for a way to explicitly set the coordinates of existing particles, use the [Position POP|Node:pop/position].

@parameters

== Location ==

System:
    Coordinate system of the __Coordinates__ parameter below.

    Cartesian:
        Specify location as X, Y, and Z coordinates.
    Cylindrical:
        Specify location as radius, theta, and Z coordinates
        (where theta is the angle between the X and Y axes).
    Polar:
        Specify location as radius, theta and phi coordinates
        (where phi is the angle between the X and Z axes).

Coordinates:
    Location in space to emit particles from.

== Birth ==

This operator has two methods for emitting particles. You can
use these methods together or separately:

* *Impulse* creates a certain number of particles each time the
  node cooks.

* *Constant* creates a certain number of particles per second.

== Attributes ==

The parameters on this tab let you control which and how
attributes are initialized on
the emitted particles. See the [POP locals|Node:pop/popLocals] page for explanations
of these variables.

@locals

TX, TY, TZ:
