"""Manually sets attributes associated with the particle's family
tree."""

"Family tree" (or "genealogical") attributes record information about
the birth of a particle. Houdini normally sets them automatically when
you create or split particles, however you can use this operator to set
their values manually.

A particle can have the following genealogical attributes:

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Attribute
        th>> Local Variable
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> ID
        td>> id
        td>> $ID
        td>> A unique number attached to the particle at birth.
    tr>>
        td>> Parent
        td>> parent
        td>> $PARENT
        td>> The ID number of the parent particle this particle split
        from.
    tr>>
        td>> Origin
        td>> origin
        td>> $ORIGIN
        td>>
            A number set on the particle by the source node from which
            the particle (or, if this particles was split off, its
            ancestors) was born. See the parameters of the [Icon:POP/source][Source
            POP|Node:pop/source] for more information on the origin
            attribute.
    tr>>
        td>> Generation
        td>> gen
        td>> $GEN
        td>> Number of generations of splitting since the Origin.
