"""Manually set physical attributes."""

This operator does not affect particle behavior independently. Instead, you
use it to set "physical" attributes such as mass, drag, and charge that
control how other operators, such affect the particles.

You can also use this operator to set the `follow` attribute, which
controls which leader a particle follows in the [Follow
POP|Node:pop/follow], which attractor point affects a particle in the
[Attractor POP|Node:pop/attractor], and which center to orbit in the
[Orbit POP|Node:pop/orbit]

This operator modifies the following attributes: `attract`, `charge`,
`drag`, `follow`, `mass`, `oaxis`, `ocenter`, `ocntrid`, `oradius`,
`ospeed` and `pscale`.

    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]


    == Physical ==

        The parameters on this tab set attributes corresponding to real
        world physical properties on the input particles. Other
        operators use these attributes to simulate the effect of forces
        on the particles.

        Mass:
            #channels: /mass

            Sets the mass of the input particles.

            Changing the mass of a particle scales forces on the
            particle according to the following formula:

            $$F = M * A$$

            where <<F>> is force, <<M>> is mass, and <<A>> is
            acceleration. So, particles with high mass require more
            force (<<F>>) to change their motion.

        Center of Mass:
            Sets the relative position of the center of mass for input
            particles.

            This is a displacement in object space from the origin
            (0,0,0) of the object. The rigid body particle representing
            an object is always placed at the origin of the object,
            which may not be the real center of the geometry. In this
            case you would specify a center of mass so that the particle
            behaves as if its center of mass is at the center of the
            geometry.

        Bounce:
            Sets the bounce coefficient of the input particles.

            When two objects collide, the product of the bounce
            coefficients of the objects determines the energy lost to
            the collision (and so the velocities of the object after the
            collision).

        Dynamic Friction:
            Sets the attribute controlling friction between two moving
            rigid body particles.

            When two objects are in contact and sliding across each
            other, the product of their dynamic friction values
            determines the force of friction acting against the sliding
            motion.

        Static Friction:
            Sets the attribute controlling friction between two
            stationary rigid body particles

            When two objects are in contact and relatively at rest, the
            product of their static friction values determines the
            amount of force required to induce a relative (sliding)
            motion of the objects.


    == Orbit ==

        The parameters on this tab control how the input particles orbit
        a center in the [Orbit POP|Node:pop/orbit].

        Axis:
            #channels: /oaxisx /oaxisy /oaxisz

            The axis around which the particle rotates (a vector normal
            to the plane of rotation).

        Center:
            #channels: /ocenterx /ocentery /ocenterz

            3D point to orbit. The interpretation of this value is
            controlled by the [Orbit POP|Node:pop/orbit].

        Radius:
            #channels: /oradius

            Radius of the orbit in units.

        Speed:
            #channels: /ospeed

            Speed of the orbit in RPM.

        Orbit Index:
            #channels: /ocntrid

            ID of the point in the "Center Group" to be used as the
            center of orbit. The interpretation of this value is
            controlled by the [Orbit POP|Node:pop/orbit].


    == Misc ==

        The parameters on this tab set attributes used by the [Attractor
        POP|Node:pop/attractor], [Follow POP|Node:pop/follow], [Interact
        POP|Node:pop/interact], and other operators.

        Follow Index:
            #channels: /follow

            The ID of the particle to follow. The interpretation of this
            value is controlled by the [Follow POP|Node:pop/follow].

        Attractor Point:
            #channels: /attract

            The point that attracts/repels the particle in the
            [Attractor POP|Node:pop/attractor].

        Charge:
            #channels: /charge

            The positive or negative "electrical charge" of the particle
            in the [Interact POP|Node:pop/interact]. Particles with
            opposite charges attract, and particles with like charges
            repel.

        Uniform Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Sets a scaling factor for the input particles. This may be
            used by the [Interact POP|Node:pop/interact] to determine
            the size of the particle's field of influence on other
            particles, and by the [Render POP|Node:pop/render] to
            control the rendered size of particles.

        Scale:
            #channels: /sx /sy /sz

            Sets non-uniform scaling factors for the input particles.

        Drag:
            #channels: /drag

            Sets the drag attribute of the input particles. Other
            operators use this attribute to control how forces affect
            the particles.

        Cling:
            #channels: /cling

            Sets the cling factor, used when the particles are
            [sliding|/particles/react].
            
            NOTE:
                Cling is implemented as a force that acts to counter forces pulling the particle away from the surface. Cling is not applied if there is no force to counter. Sliding particles apply friction to act against the tangential motion of the particle.
