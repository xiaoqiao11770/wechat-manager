= Up Vector =

"""Manually sets a particle's up vector."""

You can use this operator to set an initial up vector for new particles,
or to manually change the up vector of existing particles.

When Houdini calculates a particle's frame of reference, the velocity
defines the Z direction, the up vector defines the Y direction and the
cross product of the two defines the X direction. Whereas the particle's
_rotation_ indicates the bank/roll of the particle as it moves forward,
the frame of reference can point in a different direction from where the
particle is headed.

The frame of reference orients geometry instanced on the particle.

NOTE:
    A default rule applied to all particles transforms the Up Vector
    according to the particle's directional change from frame to frame.
    To turn off the default rule, use the [Suppress Rule
    POP|Node:pop/suppress].

Because the default rule needs to know what the previous velocity of the
particle is, this operator also adds the previous velocity attribute. If
the Up Vector is inherited from source geometry, the previous velocity
attribute will automatically be added.

The up vector is evaluated either in component form or as a vector.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `up`.
