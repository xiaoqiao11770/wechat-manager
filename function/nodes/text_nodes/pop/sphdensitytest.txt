= SPH Density Test =

"""Kills particles if the surrounding region exceeds a certain density."""

This object uses the mass, density and restdensity point attributes of
its inputs.  For each point in the source group, the POP computes the
density of the particle field in the surrounding region (that is, the
field not including the source group).  If the density exceeds a certain
threshold dependent on the particle's rest density, then the particle
is killed.

Currently, this operator is used to control the output of the [Particle
Fluid Emitter DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidemitter].


@parameters

    == SPH Density Test ==

    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]
    
    Group:
        Killed particles are inserted in to the group specified here.

    Density Threshold Multiplier:
        This parameter controls the density at which particles will
        be killed.  For example, if the __Density Threshold Multiplier__
        is set to 2.0, then particles will be killed if the density
        of the field surrounding them exceeds 2.0 times the rest
        density of the particles.

    Override Rest Density:
        When this is enabled, the __Rest Density__ parameter, rather than
        the restdensity point attribute, is used
        to determine the rest density of each particle.

    Rest Density:
        When __Override Rest Density__ is enabled, this parameter is used
        as the rest density of the particle field.
