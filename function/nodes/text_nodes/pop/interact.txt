= Interact =

"""Make particles attract or repel other particles."""

Whether particles attract or repel each other is controlled by their
`charge` attribute. Particles with opposite (that is, positive and
negative) charges attract, and like charges repel.

When two particles interact, their charges are multiplied to scale the
applied forces. By default, a positive force is a repulsive force.

If you are using Particle Intersects Effect, one particle may be within
the effect radius of another, but not vice versa. If both particles do
happen to be within the effect radius of each other, then one particle's
influence on the other is the same as the relative force applied back to
it.

To help visualize the effect of this operator, turn on the node's
[template flag|/nodes/pop]  to view the acceleration guides.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`.

    == Influence ==

        Particle Radius:
            The radius of the particle. The applied force will be
            constant in this region.


            Use Particle Size/Instance Size:
                Radius of the particle is equal to a sphere big enough
                to enclose the instanced geometry object (multiplied by
                the absolute value of the __Scale__ parameter below).
            Use Supplied Radius:
                Use the value in the __Radius__ parameter below.
        Scale:
            #channels: /pscale

            When __Particle Radius__ is __Use Particle Size/Instance
            Size__, this value lets you scale the computed radius.

        Radius:
            #channels: /pradius

            When __Particle radius__ is __Use supplied radius__, this is
            the value that is used.

        Effect Radius:
            The extent of the effect from the particle's "surface" (that
            is, out beyond the radius specified above).

            The applied force decreases slowly up close, quickly in the
            middle, and then slowly at the outside edge.
            (Mathematically, it is a half cosine.)

            Use particle radius:
                The effect radius is the same as the particle's radius
                set above. That is, the particle has no effect on other
                particles beyond its "surface".
            Use particle scale/instance size:
                Radius of the effect is equal to a sphere big enough to
                enclose the instanced geometry object (multiplied by the
                absolute value of the __Scale__ parameter below).
            Use supplied radius:
                Use the value in the __Radius__ parameter below.
        Scale:
            #channels: /escale

            When __Effect radius__ is "Use particle size/instance size",
            this value lets you scale the computed radius.

        Radius:
            #channels: /eradius

            When __Effect radius__ is "Use supplied radius", this is the
            radius to use.


    == Behavior ==

        Overlap Behavior:
            Controls what happens when the radii of two particles
            overlap.


            No force:
                The two particles do not interact.
            Random direction:
                The calculated force is applied in a random direction.
        Influence Type:
            Controls how the effect radius works.


            Particle Intersects Effect:
                The force is applied when a particle enters the effect
                radius of another particle.
            Effect Intersects Effect:
                The force is applied when one particles effect radius
                overlaps another particle's effect radius.
        Charge Behavior:
            Controls how to use the `charge` attributes of two
            interacting particles to calculate the force.


            Use both charges:
                Use the charges of both particles to scale the force.
            Use the charge of affecting particle:
                Use the charge of the particle whose effect radius the
                other particle entered.
            Use the charge of particle being affected:
                Use the charge of the particle that entered the effect
                radius of the other particle.
        Rolloff Exponent:
            #channels: /exponent

            Exponent of the roll-off function. Smaller values increase
            the effect at any given distance with the radius.

        Force Multiplier:
            #channels: /multiplierx /multipliery /multiplierz

            Multipliers for each component of the force. This lets you
            make the force stronger or weaker in a certain direction.
