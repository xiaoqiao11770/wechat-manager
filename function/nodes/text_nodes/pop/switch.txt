= Switch =

"""Switches between input streams."""

This operator passes through one of its input streams based on the
__Select Input__ parameter. This is very useful for
controlling/animating the network flow using an expression. For example,
by making the input value a function of time, you can cause different
particle behaviors at different times in the animation.


@parameters
    Select Input:
        #channels: /input

        Input number to pass through to the output. Use an expression
        here to programmatically switch the network flow.

        The inputs are numbered consecutively from 0 to N-1 (where N is
        the number of inputs to the POP). Use `0` to select the first
        input, `1` to select the second input, and so on.
