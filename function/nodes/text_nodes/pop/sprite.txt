"""Changes sprite rendering attributes like texture coordinates, SHOP,
rotation, and size."""

Houdini lets you render [render textures on
particles|/particles/instancing_rendering] , called "sprites". This operator lets
you control how the texture is applied to the particle.

NOTE:
    To see the effect of this operator in the viewer, you must set the
    viewer's  [display options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]
    to render particles as sprites.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `spriteuv`,
`spriteshop`, `spriterot` and `spritescale`. The operator will add the
attributes if they do not exist already.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Texture Offset:
        #channels: /textureoffset

        UV offset of lower-left corner.

    Texture Size:
        #channels: /texturesize

        Texture size across the sprite.

    Sprite SHOP:
        #channels: /spriteshoppath

        SHOP with which to shade the sprite.

    Resolve SHOP Path:
        If set, the Sprite SHOP path is resolved relative to this node,
        and the spriteshop attribute is set to the full path of the
        SHOP.

        If not set, no attempt is made to find the shop, and the exact
        string entered in the __Sprite SHOP__ parameter is put into the
        `spriteshop` attribute. This will prevent the sprites from
        rendering properly in the POP Viewer. The Geometry and Object
        Viewers will still render the sprites properly if the SHOP paths
        are specified relative to the object that contains the POP
        Network.

        This option is useful when creating custom operators.

    Rotate:
        #channels: /rot

        The rotation of the texture (around the view axis) in degrees.

    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Size of the sprite.
