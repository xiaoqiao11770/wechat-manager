= Rotation =

"""Rotates the particle frame of reference, allowing instanced geometry
to point in a different direction from the particle motion."""

The particle's velocity and up vector define the frame of reference on
the particle. This operator rotates the frame of reference and any
geometry instanced on the particle.

This operator lets you set the rotation as angles; use the [Torque
POP|Node:pop/torque] to rotate the frame of reference using torque.

The rotation axis is evaluated either in component form or as a vector.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `rot`.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Apply Motion:

        To all points:
            Rotate all input particles.
        To moving points:
            Only rotate particles with velocity greater than 0.
    Angle:
        #channels: /rotangle

        Angle, in degrees, to rotate to.

    Axis:
        #channels: /rotx /roty /rotz

        Axis to rotate around.
