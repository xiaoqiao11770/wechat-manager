= Torque =

"""Rotates particles around another point."""

Torque is expressed as a force applied to a position relative to the
particle's frame of reference. You specify an offset from the particle,
and a direction and magnitude to apply to that offset point. As the
offset position moves, the particle's frame of reference (and so any
instanced geometry) rotates with it.

Torque is to Angular Velocity what Force is to Velocity.

Because the __Position__ and __Force__ parameters are in the _particle's
frame of reference_, given the same position and force values, the
particle will have the same rotation at each step.

Use the [Icon:POP/rotation][Rotation POP|Node:pop/rotation] if you want to rotate particle frame of reference using angular values instead of torque.

TIP:
    To see the effect of this operator in the viewer, turn on the
    particle axes option in the viewer's  [display
    options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]. This lets you see
    the particle's frame of reference rotating.

This operator modifies the `torque` attribute.

    == Torque ==

        Force:
            #channels: /forcex /forcey /forcez

            Force magnitude

            A vector describing the force direction and magnitude. The
            direction of the vector controls the direction of the force,
            and the length of the vector controls the intensity of the
            force.

            For example, a value of (0, 1, 0) would create a force
            straight up. A value of (0, 2, 0) would represent force in
            the same direction but twice as strong.

        Position:
            #channels: /posx /posy /posz

            Offset position at which to apply the force. The farther
            away from the center, the greater the torque. The
            combination of the force direction and the offset direction
            determine the axis of spin which the torque will induce. The
            particle will have a torque causing it to spin around an
            axis perpendicular to both the offset position and the force
            direction.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Overall force scaling factor.


    == Noise ==

        The parameters on this tab add randomness to the torque. This
        makes particles more or less affected by the torque at random,
        creating a less uniform effect. The randomness is added to the
        Force vector prior to the calculation of the torque.
