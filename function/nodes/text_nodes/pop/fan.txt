= Fan =

"""Applies force on particles like a cone-shaped fan."""

The virtual fan has an origin and applies force radially from its
center. This is similar to the [Wind|Node:pop/wind] force, but moves particles in a cone shape rather than evenly in one direction.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]


    == Fan ==

        Angle:
            #channels: /angle

            Size of the cone in which the fan has maximum intensity. For
            example, `90` would create a cone with 45-degree sides. `30`
            would create a narrow cone, `120` would create a wider
            cone.

        Delta:
            #channels: /delta

            The number of degrees outside the cone defined by __Angle__
            through which the intensity drops from maximum to zero. The
            higher this number, the greater the falloff area. A value of
            `0` would make the intensity drop from maximum to 0 at the
            cone boundary.

        Rolloff:
            #channels: /rolloff

            How quickly the intensity falls from maximum to 0 in the
            delta area.

        Maximum Distance:
            #channels: /maxdistance

            The maximum distance at which a particle will be affected by
            the fan. Set this to `0` to affect all input particles.

        Strength:
            #channels: /strength

            Strength of the fan.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Scaling factor for the force applied to particles.

        Show fan in guide:
            Graphically show fan parameters when this node is
            templated.

        Guide Scale:
            #channels: /guidescale

            Scales the graphical representation of the fan parameters
            (when __Show fan in guide__ is on and the node is
            templated). Use this to make the guides more visible when
            the values are very small.

        Show acceleration in guide:
            Shows particle acceleration as part of the guide geometry
            when this node is templated.


    == Location ==

        Reference:
            The space in which to interpret the locations below.


            World space:
                The locations are in world space.
            This object:
                The locations are relative to the space of the cooking
                object.
            Referenced object:
                The locations are relative to the object in the
                __Reference object__ parameter below.
        Object:
            Object space to use, when __Reference__ is "Referenced
            object".

        Origin:
            #channels: /originx /originy /originz

            Position of the fan.

        Direction:
            #channels: /dirx /diry /dirz

            Direction in which the fan is pointing.


    == Defaults ==

        [Include:commonParms#massParms/]


    == Noise ==

        The parameters on this tab add randomness to the fan's force.
        This makes particles more or less affected at random, creating a
        less uniform effect.
