= Soft Limit =

"""Creates a boundary collisions like Limit, but with spongier
bounces."""

This operator gives nicer, less jerky bounces than the
[Icon:POP/limit][Limit|Node:pop/limit] and [Icon:POP/collision][Collision|Node:pop/collision] POPs.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Type:
        Shape of the limit boundary.

        Box:
            Rectangular limit, the corners of which are defined by the
            __+Limit__ and __-Limit__ parameters below.
        Sphere:
            Spherical limit. The sphere is still defined by a bounding
            rectangle with the limit parameters below.
    +Limit:
        #channels: /limitposx /limitposy /limitposz

        One corner of the limit's bounding box. This value should be in
        the positive quadrant (that is, the X, Y, and Z components are
        all positive).

    -Limit:
        #channels: /limitnegx /limitnegy /limitnegz

        The other corner of the limit's bounding box. This value should
        be in the negative quadrant (that is, the X, Y, and Z components
        are all negative).

    Behavior:
        Controls how the motion of particles is affected by the
        collision.

        Keep in:
            Particle stays inside the limit boundary.
        Keep out:
            Particle stays outside the limit boundary.
    Force:
        #channels: /force

        The constant force that should be applied in the shortest
        direction out of the sponge.

    Dampening:
        #channels: /vscale

        The force is reduced by the component of the particle's velocity
        traveling out of the sponge. It is increased by the component
        traveling into the sponge. This parameter scales the result of
        that calculation. The total force is never negative.

    Stable Drag:
	Performs a more conservative estimate of the dampening force to ensure
	the particles don't overreact and accelerate out of control.
