= Orbit =

"""Makes particles orbit a center-point."""

This operator calculates and applies forces necessary to make particles
orbit around a center-point.

You can use the second input to specify the center particles, or use the
parameters on the __Center__ tab to choose a group in the first input
that will specify the center.

The __Center Type__ parameter on the __Center__ tab let you choose how
the center works:

* You can specify the center with 3D coordinates.

* The "center" can be a computed point based on the center particles
  (the spatial center of the leader particles, the center of mass, or
  the center of density).

* Each particle in the center stream can be the center for individual
  particles from the satellite stream. Houdini can automatically assign
  satellites to centers, or you can set a `orbit` attribute on particles
  to determine which center they will orbit. Use the [Icon:POP/property][Property
  POP|Node:pop/property] to set the orbit-related attributes on
  particles.

Orbit works similarly to the [Icon:POP/follow][Follow POP|Node:pop/follow], which makes particles follow a leader or leaders.

TIP:
    To help visualize the effect of this operator, turn on the template
    flag to view the acceleration guides.

This operator modifies the following attribute: `accel`.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]


    == Orbit ==

        Override Axis:
            Use the value of the __Axis__ parameter below instead of the
            orbit axis attribute if it exists on a particle.

        Axis:
            #channels: /axisx /axisy /axisz

            A vector to use as the orbit axis, when __Override axis__ is
            on.

        Override Radius:
            Use the value of the __Radius__ parameter below instead of
            the orbit radius attribute if it exists on a particle.

        Radius:
            #channels: /radius

            Radius of orbit (in units), when __Override Radius__ is on.

        Override Speed:
            Use the value of the __Speed__ parameter below instead of
            the orbit speed attribute if it exists on a particle.

        Speed:
            #channels: /speed

            Speed of the orbit (in RPM), when __Override Speed__ is on.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Scaling factor that controls how fast particles move into
            their proper orbit from their initial position.


    == Center ==

        Center Group:
            Subset of points from the first input to act as centers. You
            can use this parameter instead of connecting the second
            (Center) input.

        Center Type:
            Specifies what the particles orbit around.


            Particle Spatial Center:
                The center of the box bounding the center particles.
            Particle Center of Mass:
                The center of mass of the center particles.
            Particle Density Center:
                The center of mass, with all particles having equal
                mass.
            Center Point:
                Use the coordinates in each particle's orbit center
                attribute (or the coordinates in the __Center Point__
                parameter below if __Override Center Point__ is on).
            Individual Particles:
                Each orbiting particle orbits a center particle. If you
                have `orbit`  attributes
                on the follower particles, they will use the attribute
                to decide which leader to follow (using the __Orbit
                index__ parameter below). Otherwise, Houdini will
                automatically assign followers to leaders.
        Override Center Point:
            Use the value of the __Center Point__ parameter below
            instead of the orbit center attribute if it exists on a
            particle, when __Center Type__ is "Center point".

        Center Point:
            #channels: /cntrlocx /cntrlocy /cntrlocz

            Point to orbit around, when __Center type__ is "Center
            point" and __Override Center Point__ is on.

        Orbit Index:
            (Available when __Center type__ is "Individual Particles")
            Controls how the node interprets the `orbit`
            attribute on particles to assign satellites to centers.

            Particles that do not have `orbit` attributes are assigned
            to leaders automatically, using particle order to refer to a
            leader.


            Particle ID:
                The `orbit` attribute on the satellite particles refers
                to the particle ID of the center they should orbit.
            Particle Order:
                The `orbit` attribute on the follower particles refers
                to the position of the center particle in the list of
                particles. In a particle system where leader particles
                are dying and points are being reused, this could mean
                the centers change as particles die (even if they are
                not in the center stream).
@inputs
    Orbit:
        The particles that will be made to orbit the center or centers.
    Center:
        The particles that define the center(s) to orbit. If you do not
        connect this input, you must set the __Center Group__ parameter
        on the __Center__ tab.
