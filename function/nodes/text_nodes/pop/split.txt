= Split =

"""Splits (emits) particles from existing particles."""

At each frame, each particle in the input (or in the group specified by
the __Source Group__ parameter) will birth a random number of new particles
between the minimum and maximum specified in the __Birth Probability__
parameter (on the __Birth__ tab). You can make this a true split by killing
the original particle (turn on __Kill Original Particle__ on the __Birth__
tab).

The parameters on the __Attributes__ tab let you control which attributes
the new particles inherit from the birthing particle, as well as set the
velocity of the newly split particles. If you leave the __Initial velocity__
as __Use inherited velocity__, the new particles will be traveling in the
exact same direction and speed as the original, making them indistinguishable
in the viewer unless you group them and apply different rendering to the
group.

More commonly, you will set __Initial Velocity__ to __Add to inherited velocity__
(to define the particle's new velocity relative to the birthing particle) or
__Set initial velocity__ (to set the particle's new velocity without reference to
the birthing particle). The __Velocity__ parameter lets you set the new particle's
velocity, with a random __Variance__ added for each particle (set __Variance__
to `0, 0, 0` for no random variance.

This node is useful for increasing the number of particles as time goes on. It is
also useful in combination with groups to have a group of "main" particles
that throw off differently-rendered "secondary" particles (by splitting them
into a different group). For example, an explosion effect where white-hot
central exploding parts throw off orange and red colored secondary parts.

Another classic example of a split is fireworks: use the __Activation__
parameter to only activate the split at a certain frame, split off the
"explosion" points from the "rocket" point, and kill the original
"rocket" point.

NOTE:
    The original particles will split new particles _at every frame_. This
    can quickly lead to a very large number of particles if the maximum
    birth probability value is high or if the __Life Expectancy__ of the
    new particles is long.

TIP:
    If you turn on the Bypass flag the color changes made below will not appear because the Split POP only takes reference inputs. Bypassing this node will create a break in the workflow.

@parameters

[Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

== Source ==

Emission Type:
    Where to emit the new particles from.

    Except for __From particle__, these options are the same as in
    the [Source POP|Node:pop/source]'s __Emission Type__ parameter, though
    where the Source POP emits particles from a piece of
    referenced geometry, these options emit the particles from
    the particle's _instanced_ geometry.

    From particle:
        Emit the new particles from the source particle's
        position.
        
    Points (ordered) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Points (ordered)__ option.
        
    Points (random) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Points (random)__ option.
        
    Prim. center (ordered) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Prim center (ordered)__ option.
        
    Prim. center (random) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Prim center (random)__ option.
        
    Edges (ordered) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Edges (ordered)__ option.
        
    Edges (random) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Edges (random)__ option.
        
    Surfaces (ordered) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Surfaces (ordered)__ option.
        
    Surfaces (ordered) of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Surfaces (random)__ option.
        
    Volume of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Volume__ option.
        
    Metaballs of Instance:
        See the Source POP's __Metaballs__ option.

Sample Threshold:
    #channels: /samplethreshold

    See the Source POP's __Sample Threshold__ parameter.
        
Density Threshold:
    #channels: /threshold

    See the Source POP's __Density Threshold__ parameter.

Density Minimum:
    #channels: /densitymin

    See the Source POP's __Density Minimum__ parameter.

Use Metaball Density:
    See the Source POP's __Use metaball density__ parameter.


== Birth ==

Birth Probability:
    #channels: /probmin /probmax

    How many particles to emit from each source point. This not
    a probability in the sense of "x chances out of y."
    The first number is the minimum number of particles that might
    be born each frame, and the second number is the maximum number.
    
    For example, values `0, 1` means a 50% chance of splitting off
    a particle each frame (a minimum of 0 new particles and a maximum
    of 1 new particle). Values `5, 10` means a random number between
    5 and 10 (inclusive) of particles will be split off each frame.

[Include:commonParms#birthParms/]

Kill Original Particle:
    Kill the source particle after splitting off new particles.


== Attributes ==

Inherit Attributes:
    A list of names/patterns of attributes to inherit from the
    source geometry.

[Include:commonParms#inheritVeloParms/]

[Include:commonParms#veloAttrParms/]

[Include:commonParms#useAsOriginParms/]

@locals

These variables refer to the _source particle's_ properties. They
do not refer to the properties of the instanced geometry when
birthing from instanced geometry.
