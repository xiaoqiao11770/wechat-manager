= Kill =

"""Kills particles based on expressions."""

If an expression evaluates to true (non-zero) for a particle, this
operator marks the particle as dead. You can optionally add any killed
particles to a group. This tool is similar to the [Age POP|Node:pop/age], but instead removing particles after an amount of time has elapsed, you can set rules such as removing particles that have stopped moving or collided with something.

You can generate an [event|/particles/events] when any particles are
killed.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `pstate`.

    Predefined rules:
        Use the items in this menu to fill in the __Rule__ field with a
        predefined, commonly-used rule.

        NOTE:
            The list of predefined rules is specified by
            `$HFS/houdini/POPKillRules`.


        Kill all particles:
            Kills all input particles.
        Kill stopped particles:
            Kills particles flagged as being stopped. This is not the
            same as a particle having zero velocity.
        Kill just collided particles:
            Kill any particles that collided in this timestep. See the
            definition of the `$JUSTHIT` local variable.
        Kill any collided particles:
            Kill any input particles that have collided at any point in
            the past.
    Rule:
        An expression to evaluate for each input particle. If the
        expression evaluates to true (that is, non-zero) for a particle,
        the operator marks the particle as dead.

    Group:
        Name of a new group to contain killed particles. Leave this
        blank to not put killed particles into a group.
    Preserve Group:
        If the group named in the __Group__ parameter above already
        exists, add the killed particles to it instead of replacing its
        contents.
