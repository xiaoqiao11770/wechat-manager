= Attribute Transfer =

"""Transfers point or vertex attributes from reference geometry onto
particles."""

This operator transfers [attributes|/model/attributes]  (such as normal
direction) from some referenced geometry to the input particles.

Vertex attributes are changed to point attributes for the particles if
necessary. All vertices referencing a particular point are considered a
single sample and the value of the first one is used as the sample
value.

You can choose which attributes are transferred with patterns in the
__Points__ and __Vertices__ parameters on the __Attributes__ tab.

This operator can use two different methods for controlling when and how
attributes are transferred, controlled in the __Conditions__ tab.

    SOP Group:
        Subset of the referenced geometry to use. Either a group pattern
        or a named group (created by a [Group SOP|Node:sop/group]) can
        be used.

        Primitives:
            Interpret the string as a primitive group.
        Points:
            Interpret the string as a point group.

    == Attributes ==

        Choose which attributes are transferred with patterns in the
        __Points__ and __Vertices__ parameters.

        * To transfer all available attributes, leave the field blank or
          set it to a single asterisk (`*`).

        * To exclude attributes, prefix an attribute name with the caret
          character (`^`).

        * If the first attribute is preceded by a caret (`^`), _all_
          attributes are assumed to be transferred except where
          explicitly _excluded_. Otherwise, _no_ attributes are assumed
          except where explicitly _included_.


        Points:
            List of names/patterns of point attributes to transfer. Turn
            off the checkbox to avoid transferring any point
            attributes.

        Vertices:
            List of names/patterns of vertex attributes to transfer.
            Turn off the checkbox to avoid transferring any vertex
            attributes.


    == Conditions ==

        This tab lets you choose between two methods (Weighted average
        and Smoothed particle sampling) to control when and how
        attributes are transferred.

        This tab displays different parameters depending on which method
        you choose.


        Weighted average:
            Destination attributes are interpolated from the source
            attributes using a weighted proximity technique. Attribute
            calculations use the distance between the destination point
            and the candidate source points.

        Smoothed particle sampling:
            This mode is based on the SPH (Smoothed Particle
            Hydrodynamics) model. This is a specialized model of
            attribute transfer useful in certain technical situations.

            Each attribute is sampled using the formula:

            {{{
            A(r) = Sum(over all j) (m\[j] * A\[j]/p\[j] * Wh(r-r\[j])
            }}}

            ...where <<r>> is a position in space, <<Wh>> is a
            normalized smoothing kernel over a radius <<h>>, and
            `<<m[j]>>`, `<<A[j]>>`, `<<p[j]>>`, `<<r[j]>>` are the mass,
            attribute value, density, and position of sample <<j>>.

            You might want to use the SPH model when you need to sample
            some physical quantity (say, temperature) at an arbitrary
            location in a space (generally a gas, liquid, or solid
            volume) and you have a discrete sampling of that quantity.

            You would not use it when doing things such as grabbing
            colors from geometry, but you might want to use it if, for
            example, you are estimating a force vector within a wind
            tunnel at an arbitrary point given some spatial sampling of
            the force field.


        == Weighted average ==

            Kernel Function:
                Interpolating  [metaball
                kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels] .
                The kernels are parameterized by distance and typically
                give more weight to samples that are closer.

            Kernel Radius:
                Radial extent of the kernel function. Specifies the
                drop-off radius for the kernel function. As the kernel
                radius parameter approaches zero, the filter resembles
                nearest neighbor interpolation. As the kernel radius
                parameter increases, the filter approaches uniform
                weighting.

            Max Sample Count:
                Number of closest samples to interpolate from. specifies
                the maximum number of samples to interpolate from. A
                maximum sample count of 1 gives nearest neighbor
                interpolation.

            Distance Threshold:
                Radial extent of the filter domain where the final
                attributes are determined from the source selection
                only. Specifies the maximum distance source points must
                be to be considered. Turning off this option indicates
                that no points/vertices will be excluded based on
                distance.

            Initialize Attributes to Zero:
                Zero attributes when there are no samples. Attributes
                will be set to zero if no samples are found, otherwise,
                the attribute will maintain the previous value.


        == Smoothed particle sampling ==

            SPH Kernel Function:
                Normalized smoothing function. Specifies the normalized
                smoothing kernel to use.

            SPH Kernel Radius:
                The extent over which the samples are smoothed. Samples
                outside this radius do not contribute. specifies the
                maximum distance over which the kernel acts. The actual
                radius h used above is computed based on this value for
                each kernel.

            Coefficient Attribute:
                An attribute that is used as a coefficient of the term
                for a sample in the sum. Specifies the name of the point
                attribute on the sample geometry to use as the
                `m[j]/p[j]` factor in the SPH formula.
