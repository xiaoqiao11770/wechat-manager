= Position =

"""Explicitly sets a particle's position."""

By default, Houdini moves particles automatically from frame to frame
according to their velocity. This operator lets you position the
particles directly.

NOTE:
    The default movement will _also_ be applied unless you turn the
    default movement rule off with a [Suppress Rule
    POP|Node:pop/suppress].

You can use the current position variables ($TX, $TY, and $TZ) in an
expression to make the new position relative to the current position.

For example, to move the particle by its velocity scaled by the Time
Increment (since velocity is distance-per-second), use the following
Vector expression:

{{{
#!exp
vector3($TX, $TY, $TZ) + $TIMEINC * vector3($VX, $VY, $VZ)
}}}
The position can be evaluated either in component form or as a vector.

This operator modifies: `position` (which is not actually a point
attribute).


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain]

    Apply Motion:
        To all points:
            Set the position of all particles.
        To moving points:
            Only set the position of particles which are currently in
            motion. Specifically, this excludes any stopped, stuck or
            dying particles.
            
    Position/Path/Reference:
        Position:
            Position the particle using coordinates.
        Path:
            Position the particle along a path.
        Reference:
            Position the particle in the local space of an object.

    == Param ==

        Position:
            #channels: /tx /ty /tz

            Position of the particle.


    == Path ==

        Use the parameters on this tab to position the particle at a
        point along an existing path.

        [Include:commonParms#geoSourceParms/]

        Position:
            #channels: /pathpos

            Position along the path. 0 is the starting point and 1 is the
            ending point. A value higher than 1 wraps around (according
            to the __End option__ parameter below), allowing multiple
            trips along the path.

        End Option:
            Choose whether to restart at the beginning or reverse
            direction when the value of __Position__ parameter goes past
            the end of the path.


            Cycle:
                Wrap back to the start of the path.
            Reverse:
                Reverse direction and travel back along the path the
                other way.

    == Reference ==

        Object:
            #channels: /refpath

            Path to the reference object.

        <!--
        Offset type:
            #channels: /reftype

            TBD.

        Offset:
            #channels: /reftx /refty /reftz

            TBD.
