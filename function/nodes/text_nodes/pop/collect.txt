= Collect =

"""Merges particle streams together so you can act on them
collectively."""

Complex simulations may contain many particle streams. For example, in a
fireworks display, the particles shooting up can be one stream. The
explosions are another stream. Sparkles can make up yet another particle
stream.

The Collect POP essentially allows you to merge particle streams
together. It sequences the inputs together, so following nodes will act
on all of the particles collected from this node's inputs.
