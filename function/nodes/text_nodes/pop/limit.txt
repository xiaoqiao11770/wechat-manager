= Limit =

"""Creates collisions when particles reach a limit boundary."""

This operator is very similar to the [Collision POP|Node:pop/collision],
but instead of detecting collisions with geometry, this operator detects
particles colliding with a limit boundary.

Use the parameters on the __Attribute__ tab to store information in the
colliding particles' attributes about the collision. With the exception
of the distance attribute, these attributes are not set unless a
collision has occurred.


TIP:
    Turn on the node's  [template flag|/nodes/pop]  to display the
    limit boundary as guide geometry in the viewer.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`, `dist`, `hitCd`,
`hitN`, `hitid`, `hitpos`, `hitposuv`, `hittime`, `hituv`, `numhit`.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]


    == Limits ==

        The parameters on this tab define the shape and size of the
        limit boundary. Use the __Behavior__ tab to define what happens
        when particles hit this boundary.

        Type:
            Shape of the limit boundary.

            Box:
                Rectangular limit, the corners of which are defined by
                the __+Limit__ and __-Limit__ parameters below.
            Sphere:
                Spherical limit. The sphere is still defined by a
                bounding rectangle with the limit parameters below.
        +Limit:
            #channels: /limitposx /limitposy /limitposz

            One corner of the limit's bounding box. This value should be
            in the positive quadrant (that is, the X, Y, and Z
            components are all positive).
        -Limit:
            #channels: /limitnegx /limitnegy /limitnegz

            The other corner of the limit's bounding box. This value
            should be in the negative quadrant (that is, the X, Y, and Z
            components are all negative).
