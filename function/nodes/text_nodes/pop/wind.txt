= Wind =

"""Pushes particles up to a maximum speed."""

Wind is an _additional force_, but one that is _velocity sensitive_. If
a particle is already traveling at wind velocity, then it should not
receive any extra force from it. The Wind POP simulates a pushing force
like wind, that can increase the velocity of particles but not past its
own speed. This is similar to the [Force POP|Node:pop/force]; however instead of a constant directional force, particles are accelerated to a maximum speed.

Wind accelerates particles proportionally to the wind intensity and each
particle's drag attribute (see the [Icon:POP/drag][Drag POP|Node:pop/drag]).

The application of external forces (such as with the [Icon:POP/force][Force POP|Node:pop/force])
directly affects a particle's acceleration, the rate of which is
determined by its mass (F = Mass x Acceleration).

An increase in _mass_ impedes acceleration for a given constant force.

_Drag_ is a force opposing the direction of motion. Drag is velocity
sensitive: the larger the velocity, the greater the effect of drag. It is
useful for limiting the velocity of particles.

TIP:
    Use the [Property POP|Node:pop/property] to set "physical"
    attributes of particles such as mass and drag.


TIP:
    To help visualize the effect of this operator, turn on the
    [template flag|/nodes/pop]  to view the force guides.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `accel`.

NOTE:
    The wind parameter specifies the strength (velocity) of the wind, and is the entity against which the velocity of the particles is measured. The scale parameter merely scales the resulting force that is applied to the particles. You'll want to use a wind of (0, 0, 50) with a scale of 1 rather than a wind of (0, 0, 1) with a scale of 50.

@parameters

    == Wind ==

        Wind:
            #channels: /windx /windy /windz

            A vector describing the wind direction and magnitude. The
            direction of the vector controls the direction of the wind,
            and the length of the vector controls the intensity of the
            wind.

            For example, a value of (0, 1, 0) would create wind
            traveling straight down. A value of (0, 2, 0) would
            represent wind traveling in the same direction but twice as
            strong.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Overall force scaling factor.

        [Include:commonParms#massParms/]

        Override Drag:
            Use the value of the __Drag__ parameter below instead of any
            drag attributes on the input particles.

        Drag:
            #channels: /drag

            Drag to use when __Override drag__ is on.

        Ignore Velocity:
            Ignore the velocity. By default, particles traveling at the
            wind velocity will not have any force applied to them. By
            choosing this option, the particle velocity will be ignored,
            making this the equivalent of a [Force POP|Node:pop/force].


    == Noise ==

        The parameters on this tab add randomness to the wind. This
        makes particles more or less affected at random, creating a less
        uniform effect.
