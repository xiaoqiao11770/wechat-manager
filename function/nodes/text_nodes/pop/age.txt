= Age =

"""Sets the ages and/or expected lifespan of particles."""

This operator modifies the `life` attribute. By default, Houdini ages
particles by the amount of time in between cooking. This operator lets
you age of particles manually. This tool is similar to the [Kill POP|Node:pop/kill], but instead removing particles that have stopped moving or collided with something, you can remove particles after an amount of time has elapsed.

NOTE:
    The default aging will _also_ be applied unless you turn the default
    aging rule off with a [Suppress Rule operator|Node:pop/suppress].

Possible uses of this operator include:

* When particles  [collide|/particles/react]  with geometry (visible
  or invisible), change their lifespan.

* Use an expression to set the age relative to velocity to make
  fast-moving particles die faster.


@parameters

[Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

Age:
    #id: age

    Sets the age in seconds. Use an expression such as `$AGE + <<n>>`
    or `$AGE - <<n>>` to change the particle's age relatively.

Lifespan:
    #id: lifespan

    Sets the total expected lifespan in seconds.
