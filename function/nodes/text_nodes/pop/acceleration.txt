= Acceleration =

"""Explicitly sets a particle's acceleration."""

This operator modifies the `accel` attribute. The acceleration can be
evaluated either in [component form or as a
vector|/particles/component_vs_vector] .


TIP:
    Velocity is the _rate of movement_, acceleration is the _change in
    rate of movement_.


TIP:
    To help visualize the effect of this operator, turn on the
    [template flag|/nodes/pop]  to view the acceleration guides.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Apply Motion:

        To all points:
            Set the acceleration of all particles.
        To moving points:
            Only set the acceleration of particles which are currently
            in motion. Specifically, this excludes any stopped, stuck or
            dying particles.
    Acceleration:
        #channels: /ax /ay /az

        The acceleration to apply to the specified particles.
