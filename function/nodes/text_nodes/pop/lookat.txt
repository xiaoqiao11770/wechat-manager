= Lookat =

"""Rotates particles so they point in a certain direction."""

This operator rotates the input particles to look in a direction or look
at a point. This is useful when you are using [sprites|/particles/instancing_rendering]]
(to keep the texture facing the camera) and [particle
replacement|/particles/instancing_rendering]  (for example, to keep the models
pointed toward their goal).

This operator modifies the following attributes: `rot`.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Lookat Mode:
        How to orient the input particles.


        Lookat plane:
            Look at the plane defined by the __Direction__ parameter.
        Lookat point:
            Look right at the point
    Reference:
        Transform space in which to interpret the __Direction__
        parameter.


        World space:
            Use world space.
        This object:
            Use the local space of the cooking object.
        Referenced object:
            Use the local space of the object named in the __Object__
            parameter.
    Object:
        Object in whose local space to interpret the __Direction__
        parameter, when __Reference__ is "Reference object".

    Direction:
        #channels: /dirx /diry /dirz

        Vector for the lookat direction, interpreted in the space
        specified in the __Reference__ parameter above.

        The vectorâ€™s origin is at 0, 0, 0 in the Reference space. As an
        example, a direction of (0, 0, 1) means a vector pointing down
        the Z axis.
