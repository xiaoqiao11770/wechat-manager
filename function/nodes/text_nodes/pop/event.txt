= Event =

"""Generates events based on rules."""

This operator lets you define a expression which, if it evaluates to
true (non-zero) for an input particle, generates an
[event|/particles/events] .

You can use events to trigger other POPs by using the
[popevent|Exp:popevent] test function in their __Activation__ fields.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Event Name:
        Name of the event to generate

    Predefined rules:
        Use the items in this menu to fill in the __Rule__ field with a
        predefined, commonly-used rule.

        NOTE:
            The list of predefined rules is specified by
            $HFS/houdini/POPEventRules.


        Any particle is dead:
            An input particle is dead.
        Any particle is stopped:
            An input particle is flagged as being stopped. This is not
            the same as a particle having zero velocity.
        Any particle just collided:
            An input particle collided in this timestep. See the
            definition of the `$JUSTHIT` local variable.
        Any particle has collided:
            An input particle has collided at any point in the past.
    Rule:
        An expression to evaluate for each input particle. If the
        expression evaluates to true (that is, non-zero) for a particle,
        the operator generates the event specified in the __Event Name__
        parameter.
