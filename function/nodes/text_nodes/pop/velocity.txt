= Velocity =

"""Explicitly sets a particle's velocity."""

NOTE:
    The default rules that normally set the velocity of particles based
    on their acceleration will _also_ be applied unless you turn them
    off with the [Suppress Rule POP|Node:pop/suppress].


TIP:
    Velocity is the _rate of movement_, acceleration is the _change in
    rate of movement_.

To set particle acceleration, use the [Acceleration
POP|Node:pop/acceleration].

The velocity can be evaluated either in component form or as a vector.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `v`.


@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Apply Motion:

        To all points:
            Set the velocity of all particles.
        To moving points:
            Only set the velocity of particles which are currently in
            motion. Specifically, this excludes any stopped, stuck or
            dying particles.
    Velocity:
        #channels: /vx /vy /vz

        The velocity to apply to the specified particles.
