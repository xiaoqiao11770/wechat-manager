= Attractor =

"""Attracts or repels particles using a referenced Force SOP or Point
SOP."""

This operator attracts or repels the input particles toward/away from a
force defined by a [Icon:SOP/force][Force SOP|Node:sop/force] (for metaballs) or the
Force tab of a [Icon:SOP/point][Point SOP|Node:sop/point] (for other geometry types).

The magnitude of the referenced force determines the how much the force
attracts or repels the particles, but it interacts with the mass and
charge attributes of the particles (if a
particle is negatively charged the effect of this operator is reversed),
unless you use the __Ignore charge__ and __Ignore mass__ options.

NOTE:
    To apply a global force to particles, use the [Icon:SOP/force][Force
    POP|Node:pop/force].

You can use a SOP connected to one of the POP networks inputs as the
attractor, or reference an arbitrary SOP, according to the __Attractor
use__ parameter on the __Attractor__ tab.

* Using an input gives you the flexibility to easily change which
  geometry to use for the attractor, either manually or
  programatically.

* Using an explicit reference is useful when the attractor geometry is
  in a known location and is not expected to change.
  
This force is similar to the [Follow POP|Node:pop/follow]. This tool should be used when you want to attract particles to a static object, whereas the follow tool should be used when you want to attract particles to a moving object.

This operator modifies the `accel` attribute.

    == Attractor ==

        Attractor Use:
            How the points of the attractor affect the input particles.


            All points:
                All points affect each particle.
            Single point per particle:
                Only one point affects each particle. The `attract`
                attribute controls. Use the [Property
                POP|Node:pop/property] to set the attractor-related
                attribute on particles.
        [Include:commonParms#geoSourceParms/]

        Stop At Attractor:
            Particles stop when they reach the attractor.

        Scale:
            #channels: /scale

            Multiplies or divides the force of the attractor.

        Show attractor radius in guide:
            Shows the radius of the force as part of the node's guide
            geometry. Turn on the node's  [template
            flag|/nodes/pop]  to see the guides.

        Show acceleration in guide:
            Shows the applied acceleration as part of the node's guide
            geometry. Turn on the node's  [template
            flag|/nodes/pop]  to see the guides.

    == Noise ==

        The parameters on this tab add randomness to the attraction
        force. This makes particles more or less attracted at random,
        creating a less uniform effect.
