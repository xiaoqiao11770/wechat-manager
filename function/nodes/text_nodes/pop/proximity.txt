= Proximity =

"""Sets attributes on and/or creates groups of particles based on which
other particles are nearby."""

This operator sets attributes on the input particles that record which
other particles are closest and how far away they are.

You can also use groups containing the particles nearby (within a
certain distance of) each particle. The groups are created by taking the
value of the __Group Name Root__ parameter and appending the ID of the
particle the group corresponds to.

This operator modifies the following attributes: `nearest`,
`nearestdist`, and `numproximity`.

TIP:
    Note the option __Use point numbers instead of IDs__. Point numbers
    are reused, while a particles ID is unique within the simulation and
    is not re-used. You might want to double-check this if the numbers
    you are getting do not seem right.

@parameters
    [Include:commonParms#commonMain/]

    Candidate Group:
        Compare against a different subset of the input particles from those
        specified by the __Source Group__ parameter.  Useful to find the
        nearest neighbor from a particular group, for example.

    Add Nearest Neighbor Attribute:
        Sets the `nearest` attribute on each input particle to the ID of
        the nearest particle.

    Add Nearest Distance Attribute:
        Sets the `nearestdist` attribute on each input particle to the
        distance to the nearest particle.

    Add Number in Proximity Attribute:
        Sets the `numproximity` attribute on each input particle to the
        number of particles within the distance defined by the
        __Proximity Radius__ parameter below.

    Create Proximity Particle Groups:
        When this option is on, the operator creates new particle groups
        corresponding to each input particle, containing the particles
        closer than the __Proximity Radius__ to that particle.

    Create Groups For:
        Only use a subset of the input particles (created with, for
        example, a [Group POP|Node:pop/group] or [Collision
        POP|Node:pop/collision]) when filling the new groups of nearby
        particles.

    Group Name Root:
        The base name of the new groups created by this particle. The
        operators names the groups by appending the ID (or point number,
        if __Use point numbers instead of IDs__ is on below) of the
        source particle to this base name.

    Include Self in Proximity Groups:
        Include the source particle in the proximity group.

    Proximity Radius:
        #channels: /proximityradius

        Distance within which other particles are grouped.

    Use Point Numbers Instead of IDs:
        Use the point number instead of IDs to indicate particles. IDs
        are unique to each individual particle, while point numbers
        refer to a position in the list of particles. In a particle
        system where particles are dying and points are being reused,
        this could mean the "nearest" particle could change as particles
        die (even if they're not within the __Proximity Radius__.
