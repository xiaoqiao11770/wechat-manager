"""Interface to a variety of PuppetWorks devices through a serial port
connection."""

This CHOP allows you to interface to a variety of PuppetWorks devices
through a serial port connection. This CHOP is always time sliced. If
you want to record the data, attach a Record CHOP.

Initializing a PuppetWorks device can take up to 6 seconds. This done
when the CHOP is first created, when the serial port parameter is
changed, and when the __Reset Puppet__ button is pressed. All detected
encoders will be recorded. Two channels are created for each encoder.


@parameters

    == Puppet ==

        Active:
            Data is received from the device while active is on. When
            off, the last value is held.
        Record Mode:
            Determines whether to record a single frame or a time slice.

            Current Frame:
                Only the latest frame from the device is recorded.
                Excess data is discarded.
            Current Time Slice:
                All the data received from the device since the last
                cook is recorded. No data is lost, but at high sampling
                rates, cook time may increase dramatically.
        Report Rate:
            Sets both the channel sample rate and the PuppetWorks device
            sampling rate (supported rates are 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 15,
            20, 24, 30, 50, 60, 100, 120, 180 or 240Hz). 

		NOTE: 
			High rates with a large number of encoders may exceed the bandwidth of the serial connection, resulting in ever-increasing cook times. 

			In this case, set the BAUD rate to the highest rate (38.4K) and use the lowest possible report rate.
        Use Cycles:
            Turns the device cycle count on or off. If on, turning the
            joint in a complete rotation will increase the rotation by
            360. If off, the range will be clamped to -180 to 180.

    == Calibrate ==

        Grab Zero Position:
            The current joint rotations are assumed to be 'zero'. Press
            to grab a neutral position.
        Use Zero Position:
            If on, the rotations are calibrated relative to the zero
            position, otherwise, the raw rotations are used.
        Write Zero Position:
            Writes the current zero position to
            $HOME/houdini/puppet.pref. This position will be read every
            time a new Puppet CHOP is created or loaded.

    == Port ==

        Port:
            The serial port that the device is connected to.
        Port Name:
            If __Port__ is set to __Other Port__, this parameter specifies
            the port name.
        Baud Rate:
            The BAUD rate setting for the device, either 9.6K, 19.2K, or
            38.4K. Faster rates are required for a large number of
            joints, or high sampling rates (more than 30Hz).
        Reset Puppet:
            Resets the puppet by shutting it down and reinitializing.
            This takes about 6 seconds.
