"""Generates sounds in two ways."""

The Oscillator CHOP generates sounds in two ways. It synthesizes tones
using a choice of common waveforms, or it repeats a prepared incoming
audio clip of any duration.

When it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, it steps through
the waveform at a rate that depends on the _Pitch Control_ input. By
default, a Pitch Control of `0` gives a middle A at 440 Hz; A `1` gives 880
Hz; A `-1` gives 220 Hz. Steps of `1` in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart.
Steps of `1/12` (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.

Up to three input chops can be used.

== Pitch Control ==

    The first input affects the pitch. (It is "logarithmic".) Output
    channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel.

== Reset Pulse ==

    The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the
    oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. `0`
    in the input means "play the oscillator". `1` means "stop the
    oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback
    Source".

== Playback Source ==

    The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It
    is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and
    can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for
    each Pitch Control channel. The __Waveform Type__ and the __Base Frequency__
    parameters are disabled.

    If you plug any sound clip into the Oscillator CHOP's Playback
    Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of `0` of any duration,
    it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a Wave chop as
    its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the
    input.

    The Oscillator CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper. If
    you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the
    time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. `0` pitch is
    normal speed, `1` is double speed.

    Unlike the Waveform CHOP, this is an iterating chop, that is, it
    steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this
    effect, feed a [Wave CHOP|wave] into the Oscillator.


@parameters

    == Waveform ==

        Type:
            The shape of the waveform to repeat. Sine, Gaussian,
            Triangle, Ramp, Square, Pulse
        Base Frequency:
            #channels: /frequency

            Cycles per second when Pitch Control is 0.
        Units per Octave:
            #channels: /octave

            Amount that the Pitch Control needs to increase by to raise
            the pitch by one octave. The default of 1 means that a Pitch
            Control of 1 raises the pitch by one octave.
        Offset:
            #channels: /offset

            Values output from the CHOP can have an added to them.
        Amplitude:
            #channels: /amp

            Values output from the CHOP can be scaled.
        Bias:
            #channels: /bias

            Shape control for Triangle, Gaussian and Square waves. For
            triangle waves, it moves the peak. For square waves, it
            alters the width.
        Phase:
            #channels: /phase

            A value of .5 is a phase shift of 180 degrees, or one half
            cycle.
        Smooth Pitch Changes:
            Samples the pitch curve for every sample between frames vs.
            using a single per-frame value.

    == Channel ==

        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the CHOP.
