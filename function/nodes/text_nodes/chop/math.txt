"""Perform a variety of arithmetic operations on and between channels."""

This CHOP allows you to perform a variety of arithmetic operations on
and between channels. Channels of a CHOP can be combined, and several
CHOPs can be combined.

== Unary Operations ==

    Unary operations are performed on individual channels. Unary
    operations are:

    Off:
        Don't do anything to the channel.
    Negate:
        Take the negative value of each sample of the channel.
    Positive:
        Make negative values of the channel positive (absolute).
    Root:
        Take the square root of all values in the channel.
    Square:
        Square all the values in the channel.
    Inverse:
        Take the inverse (1/x) of all values in the channel.

== Combine Channels ==

    Operations between channels can be done within an input or between
    inputs. The operations are done on a sample by sample basis:

    Off:
        Don't combine the channels.
    Add:
        Sum all the channels.
    Subtract:
        Subtract all the channels from the first.
    Multiply:
        Take the product of all the channels.
    Divide:
        Divide the first channel by all the rest.
    Average:
        Take the average of all the channels.
    Maximum:
        Take the maximum value of all the channels.
    Minimum:
        Take the minimum value of all the channels.
    Length:
        Assume the channels are a vector and compute its length.

@parameters

    == OP ==

        Channel Pre OP:
            A menu of unary operations that are performed on single
            channels as they come in to the Math CHOP.
        Combine Channels:
            A menu of operations that is performed between the channels
            of a single input CHOP, for each input.
        Combine CHOPs:
            A menu of operations that is performed between the input
            CHOPs, combining several CHOPs into one.
        Channel Post OP:
            A menu of more unary operations that is performed on the
            channels resulting from the above operations.
        Match By:
            Match channels between inputs by name or number.

	    When matching by name, the number of output channels is the number
	    of channels from the first input. For each channel of the first
	    input, the channel of the same name is taken from the other inputs.
	    If a channel name cannot be found, then it is omitted. Only the
	    channels whose names occur in the first input will be used to
	    generate the output channels. Channels whose names do not occur in
	    the first input will not affect the output channels. 

	    When matching by number, the number of output channels is the
	    maximum number of channels out of all the inputs. Then for each
	    input, the original sequence of channels is repeated to match the
	    number of output channels.
        Align:
            The alignment to use when aligning channels from different
            inputs. See the help for the Merge CHOP.

    == Mult-Add ==

        Pre-Add:
            #channels: /preoff

            First, add value to each new channel.
        Multiply:
            #channels: /gain

            Then multiply by this value.
        Post-Add:
            #channels: /postoff

            Then add this value.

    == Range ==

        From/To Range:
            #channels: /fromrange12 /torange12

            Another way to multiply/add. Converts from one low-high
            range to another range.
