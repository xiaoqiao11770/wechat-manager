"""Internal node used by the Foreach CHOP"""

The For node is a read-only internal node created by the Foreach CHOP. It 
contains the current channel group used during the cooking of its parent 
Foreach CHOP. It cannot be removed, modified or created by the user. Its output
is used to drive cooking within the Foreach CHOP.
