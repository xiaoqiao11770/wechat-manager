"""Uses a geometry object to choose a sop from which the channels will be created."""

The Geometry CHOP uses a geometry object to choose a SOP from which the
channels will be created. The channels are created from the point
attributes of a SOP, such as the X, Y and Z of the point position.

The SOP can select a subset of the points using Point Groups. The set of
attributes that are converted to channels are chosen using the names of
the attributes seen on the Info pop-up of SOP tiles.

== See the Channel SOP ==

    NOTE:
        This CHOP works in tandem with the _Geometry >_ [Channel
        SOP|Node:sop/channel]. Point data can be modified in CHOPs and
        then fed back to SOPs through the Channel SOP, therefore be sure
        to take a look at the Channel SOP description.


@parameters

== Geometry ==

SOP:
    Retrieves the geometry from the SOP pointed to by this path.
Group:
    Fetch only the points within this point group. If blank, all points are fetched.
Method:
    The geometry fetch method.

    Static:
        Creates one channel for each attribute, and all points
        use this channel (the first point resides at index 0,
        the next at 1, and so on). The length of the channels
        will be the number of points fetched.
    Animated:
        Creates one channel per attribute per point. The
        channels show the animation of each point's
        position/attribute values.
Attribute Scope:
    A string list of attributes to fetch from the SOP. The common attributes are:

    `P`:
        Point position (X, Y, Z) - 3 values.
    `Pw`:
        Point weight with a value of 1.
    `Cd`:
        Point color (red, green, blue) - 3 values.
    `Alpha`:
        Point alpha with a value of 1.
    `N`:
        Point normal value (X, Y, Z) - 3 values.
    `uv`:
        point texture coordinates (U,V,W) - 3 values.
Rename Scope:
    The names to use for the newly fetched attributes. There must be one name per attribute, so an attribute scope of `P` should have a rename scope with three names (like tx ty tz).
Filter by Attribute:
    Specifies a point integer attribute to use as bitmask based of rename scope index.

    If the rename scope is set to "tx ty tz", the first 3 bits of the integer determines which channels are created.

    - tx bit is activated by a value of 1.
    - ty bit is activated by a value of 2.
    - tz bit is activated by a value of 4.

    - A value of 3 means the tx and ty bits are active.
    - A value of 5 means the tx and tz bits are active.
    - A value of 6 means the ty and tz bits are active.
    - A value of 7 means the tx,ty,tz bits are active.
    
    NOTE:
        This only applies to __Animated__ Method.

Transform Object:
    If a transform object is specified, the point values will be represented relative to that object's origin and rotation.
Organize by Attribute:
    Rebuilds the fetched channels by the value of this attribute. A common example is the `id` attribute found in particles. A channel is built for each unique id since the number of points may vary.
    
    NOTE:
        This only applies to __Animated__ Method.

Point Names:
     Specifies a point string attribute to use as a prefix when building channel names. Without this, channels are named by appending the point index. 
     
     NOTE:
        This only applies to __Animated__ Method.

== Channel ==

Channel Range:
    Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

    Use Full Animation Range:
        All of the current global animation range.
    Use Current Frame:
        Only the sample at the current frame.
    Use Start/End:
        Specify the range using the Start/End parameters.
Start/End:
    #channels: /start /end

    The time range over which to fetch the geometry values when __Animated__ Method is selected.
Sample Rate:
    #channels: /rate

    The sample rate to use for the fetched channels.
Extend Left:
    The extend condition before the channel's beginning.
Extend Right:
    The extend condition after the channel's ending.
Default Value:
    #channels: /defval

    The value of the default value extend condition.
