= Hold =

"""Sample and hold the value of the first input."""

The Hold CHOP allows you to sample and hold the value of the first
input. The second input controls the sampling. When the second input
changes from `0` to `1`, the first input is sampled. This value is held in
the output until the second input changes from `0` to `1` again. Hold does
not sample while the second input is 1, nor on the falling edge (1 to
0).

A common application for this chop is to grab the current value of a
channel when an event occurs, so that value can be used until the event
occurs again.

This CHOP can be time-sliced by enabling the __Time Slice__ parameter. It
can also take advantage of __Minimal Time Slice Cooks__ in time slice mode
(see the Time Slice Preferences dialog in the Options menu).
