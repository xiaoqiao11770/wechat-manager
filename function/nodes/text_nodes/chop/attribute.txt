= Attribute =

"""Adds, removes or updates attributes of the input chop."""

This CHOP adds, removes or updates attributes of the input chop.
Currently there is only one attribute type, a "quaternion". This
attribute type is used to group rotation channel triplets (rx,ry,rz)
together.

Rotations sometimes need to be grouped together since interpolations on
independent X, Y and Z rotations do not produce smooth results.
Rotations often need Quaternion interpolation to rotate through the most
direct path.

Operations such as resampling and blending recognize the rotation
triplet with the "quaternion" attribute. They blend or resample the
rotation channels using "spherical linear interpolation". Ordinary
interpolation can produce poor blending results, whereas quaternion
blending produces the shortest rotation path between two sets of
rotations.

See some of the chops that use the attribute: the [Sequence
CHOP|Node:chop/sequence] and [Composite CHOP|Node:chop/comp].
Other chops may quietly use
the Quaternion attribute, such as the Object, Stretch and Resample
chops.

The __Scope__ is needed to specify the channels that will be grouped.

== Standard Options and Local Variables ==

    == Scope ==

        Selects which channels are X,Y and Z rotations. The channels can
        be typed in explicitly, or using wildcards. If the number of X,Y
        and Z rotations selected do not match, an error will occur.
        Example:

        {{{
        *r[xyz]
        }}}

@parameters

    == Quaternion ==

        Function:
            The function to perform on the attributes:

            Pass Through:
                Leaves the attributes untouched.
            Replace:
                Erases previous attributes and replaces them with the
                new ones.
            Append:
                Keeps previous attributes and combines them with the new
                attributes. If an attribute already exists on a channel
                and append attempts to overwrite it, an error will
                occur.
            Remove:
                Removes all scoped channels' attributes.
        Rotate Order:
            Sets the rotation order of the rotation triplet.
        Scope:
            Selects which channels are X,Y and Z rotations. The channels
            can be typed in explicitly, or using wildcards. If the
            number of X,Y and Z rotations selected do not match, an
            error will occur. For example: `*r[xyz]`.
