"""Makes an irregular wave that never repeats, with values approximately in the range -1 to +1."""

The Noise CHOP makes an irregular wave that never repeats, with values
approximately in the range `-1` to `+1`. It appears to have a period like
the [Wave CHOP|wave], but it is not exact. It generates both smooth curves and
noise that is random each sample. It uses the same math as the Noise
Texture Operator.

Optionally, an input can be connected. It is assumed that the input
contains 1 to 3 channels representing X, Y and Z coordinates of points
in space, and are used to sample anywhere in 3D noise space. One index
in the input produces one sample in the output.

== *Optional input: XYZ sample points* ==

    Normally the noise is sampled along the X-axis in an XYZ noise
    space. You can sample anywhere in XYZ.


@parameters

    == Noise ==

        Type:
            The noise function used to generate noise.

            Sparse:
                Produces high quality, continuous noise.
            Hermite:
                Produces lower quality noise than Sparse, but quicker.
            Harmonic Summation:
                Sparse noise with the ability to control the frequency
                step of the harmonics.
            Brownian:
                Produces "Brownian" motion, similar to insect flight.
            Random:
                Every sample is random and unrelated to any other
                sample. Also know as "white noise" in audio.
        Seed:
            #channels: /seed

            Any number, integer or non-integer. Each number generates
            completely different noise patterns, but with similar
            characteristics.
        Period:
            #channels: /period

            The approximate separation between peaks of a noise cycle,
            expressed in Units.
        Harmonics:
            #channels: /harmon

            The number of higher frequency components to layer on top of
            the base frequency.
        Harmonic Spread:
            #channels: /spread

            The factor by which the frequency of the harmonics are
            increased.
        Roughness:
            #channels: /rough

            The amount of the effect of the higher frequency harmonics.
        Exponent:
            #channels: /exp

            Pushes the noise values toward `0`, or `+1` and `-1` (raising the
            noise to the this power).
        Num of Integrals:
            #channels: /numint

            The number of times to integrate Brownian noise, which
            affects its smoothness.
        Amplitude:
            #channels: /amp

            The noise's amplitude.

    == Constraint ==

        Normalize:
            Ensures that all noise curves fall between `-1` and `1`.
        Constraint:
            Allows the noise curve to start and/or end at selected
            values. The average value may also be constrained.
        Starting Value:
            #channels: /constrstart

            The value noise curves should start at.
        Ending Value:
            #channels: /constrend

            THe value noise curves should end at.
        Mean Value:
            #channels: /constrmean

            The mean value noise curves should have.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Name:
            The names of the channels to be created.
        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the current global animation range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range using the Start/End parameters.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The start of the channels.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end of the channels.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the channels.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions of the channels.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions of the channels.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for extend conditions.

        The current channel (0 to NC-1).
