"""Creates a jiggling effect in the translate channels passed in."""

This CHOP creates a jiggling effect in the translate channels passed in.
All channels ending in `tx`,`ty`, and `tz` are processed as a vector. If one of
these translate vectors is missing a component, it is ignored.

@parameters

== Jiggle ==

    Stiffness:
        How tight the jiggle is. Values closer to zero will cause the
        translate values to stray more from their original values.
        Values closer to one will result in very close solutions.
    Damping:
        The amount of damping on jiggle oscillations. More damping
        reduces oscillating around abrupt changes in direction.
    Limit:
        This controls how far away the point is allowed to stray from
        the original value before it starts being pulled towards it.
    Flex Amount:
        This controls the strength of the spring. Larger values will
        cause the translate values to stray more from their original
        values.
    Multiplier:
        This controls a post-scaling effect on the values of the
        channel.
    Reference:
        This gives an object path that the resulting values would be
        relative to. Note that the __Multiplier__ is applied in the
        reference space.
