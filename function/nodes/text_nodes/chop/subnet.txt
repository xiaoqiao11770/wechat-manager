"""Allows for the simplification of complex networks by collapsing
several CHOPs into one."""

This CHOP allows for the simplification of complex networks by
collapsing several CHOPs into one. Four inputs are provided to connect
CHOPs in the subnetwork with CHOPs in the parent network.

Subnetwork CHOPs can also be nested within each other.

== SubNet ==

    Input 1-4:
        The four string parameters allow labels to be specified for the
        four inputs to the subnetwork. 

	These labels appear when the
        middle mouse button is depressed on the input connections and
        will be useful to document the usage of each input to the
        subnetwork.
    SubNet CHOP:
        This menu designates exactly one CHOP within the subnet as the
        default output.
