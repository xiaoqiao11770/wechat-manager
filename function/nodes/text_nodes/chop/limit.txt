"""Provides a variety of functions to limit and quantize the input channels."""

This CHOP provides a variety of functions to limit and quantize the input channels.

Limiting a channel causes all its values to lie within a range. Several different methods are available for limiting:

Off:
	Do not limit the values.
Clamp:
	Simply cut the channel value off if it is out of the Maximum/Minimum range, and replace it with the Maximum or Minimum limit value.
Loop:
	Continue the channel at the other end of the interval.
Zigzag:
	Mirror the values back inside the interval.

Quantizing a channel value snaps its values to the closest allowable
value (the "quantized values"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling,
and Round.

Quantizing a channel index is like quantizing in time, and acts as a
sample and hold mechanism. The channel is sampled at a quantized index,
and held at that value until the next quantized index at which time the
value takes on the input value at that point.


@parameters

    == Limit ==

        Type:
            The limit function to use:

            Off:
                Do not limit the values.
            Clamp:
                Simply cut the channel value off if it is out of the
                Maximum/Minimum range, and replace it with the Maximum
                or Minimum limit value.
            Loop:
                Continue the channel at the other end of the interval.
            Zigzag:
                Mirror the values back inside the interval.
        Maximum:
            #channels: /max

            The maximum value the output channel can have.
        Minimum:
            #channels: /min

            The minimum value the output channel can have.
        Positive Only:
            Takes the absolute value of the channel, making all negative
            values positive.
        Normalize:
            Scale and shift the channel so that it lies between -1 and
            +1.

    == Quantize ==

        Quantize Value:
            Selects the quantization method to use: Off, Floor, Ceiling,
            and Round.
        Value Step:
            #channels: /vstep

            The increment between quantized values.
        Value Offset:
            #channels: /voffset

            The offset for quantized values, to allow steps to not lie
            at zero, the default.
        Quantize Index:
            Selects whether to quantize the index relative to the sample
            0, or the start index of the CHOP.
        Index Step:
            #channels: /istep

            The increment between quantized indices, in seconds, frames
            or samples.
        Index Offset:
            #channels: /ioffset

            The offset for quantized indices.
            
    [Include:common]            
            
@locals
    C:
        the current channel (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        the total number of channels.
