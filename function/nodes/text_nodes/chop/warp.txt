"""Time-warps the channels of the first input (the Pre-Warp Channels)
using one warping channel in the second input."""

This CHOP time-warps the channels of the first input (the Pre-Warp
Channels) using one warping channel in the second input (the Warp
Curve). The Warp Curve acts as either a rate control or an index
control, as explained below.

In the Rate Control Method, feeding the Warp CHOP a Warp Curve with a
constant value of `1` makes the output identical to the Pre-Warp Channels,
assuming the two inputs have the same start-end interval. That is, where
the rate is `1`, the Pre-Warp Channels are not warped.

Where the Warp Curve is above `1`, it causes a speed-up in the animation.
Where the Warp Curve is below `1`, it causes a slow-down in the animation.
Rates less than `0` cause the animation to go in reverse.

In the Index Control Method, the Warp Curve acts as an index into the
first input. If the Warp Curve is a straight ramp with a slope of `1` (in
Units), it produces unwarped output channels. If Units is set to
Seconds, a Warp Curve value of `0` gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at
time 0 seconds. A Warp Curve value of `2` gets the Pre-Warp Channels'
values at time 2 seconds.

The Warp CHOP will output the same number of channels and channel names
as the Pre-Warp Channels input, and the sample rate will be the same as
that of the Pre-Warp input. However, the CHOP will output the same
start-end time interval as the Warp Curve input.

If you take a Warp Curve and pass it directly to a Warp CHOP with the
Rate Control Method, it is equivalent to passing the same curve to an
[Area CHOP|area] and then passing it to the Warp CHOP with the Index Control
Method.
