"""Removes channels coming from its input."""

The Delete CHOP removes channels coming from its input. The channels are
selected by a variety of methods, which may be layered. The first method
uses a text string to select channels by name or index. The second
method uses a value range to select channels with samples within or
outside the range. The third method selects constant-valued channels.

An option selects whether to delete or output the selected channels.
