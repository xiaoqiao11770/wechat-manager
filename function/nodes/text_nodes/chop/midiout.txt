"""The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events to any available MIDI
devices."""

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events to any available MIDI devices. These
devices can be other software programs (midisynth) or devices attached
to the serial ports. Channels are used to control the sending of the
MIDI events. The channels are evaluated over the last time slice (from
the last framebar position to the current).

An event is sent every time a channel changes its value during this
slice. All timing is preserved, as long as the framebar is running in
realtime. Channels are mapped to events by their name. Events like
notes, controllers and velocities must be followed by the
note/controller number (n65, c7). 

If the number is left off a note
event, the note number is the value of the channel. Other events, which
are sent to the entire channel, do not need a trailing number (pc, pw).
The channel prefix can be used to identify the MIDI channel the event
should be sent on (i.e. "ch1n45" assigns that Houdini channel to note 45
messages on MIDI channel 1).


@parameters

    == Dest ==

        MIDI Destination:
            Where the MIDI events are sent to.
        MIDI File:
            The filename of the output MIDI file.
        Write MIDI File:
            Writes all the data to a MIDI file.
        MIDI Channels:
            The MIDI channel(s) to output to. If a channel prefix is not
            given, all channels will receive the same events.
        Channel Prefix:
            The prefix string that all input channels must have in order
            to extract the channel number from their name (ie.
            `ch1note44`, with a channel prefix of `ch`).
        Echo Messages To Textport:
            If enabled, all MIDI events are logged in the textport as
            they occur.

    == Output ==

        Pre-Queue Time:
            MIDI events are generated and queued this amount of time
            ahead of the current frame.
        Delay Time:
            All events will be played later by this amount of time.
        Max Jump Time:
            If the Frame Bar increases by this amount or more since the
            last cook, MIDI events in that interval will be skipped.
        Recovery Method:
            If Houdini could not cook in time to generate the next MIDI
            events, it recovers by one of three methods. Missed events
            are skipped, delayed or output immediately.
        Automatic Note:
            'All Note Off' events can be sent upon the start Off and/or
            end of the output.
        All Notes Off:
            Sends an All Notes Off message to all MIDI channels.

    == Note ==

        Note Name:
            The base name of the note channels. 

	    If input channels have a
            number after the name, it is assumed to be the note number.
            If not, the channel value is assumed to contain the note
            number.
        Velocity Name:
            The base name of the velocity channels.
        Aftertouch Name:
            The name of the aftertouch channel.
        Pressure Name:
            The name of the channel pressure channel.
        Normalize:
            Channel values in the range `0-1` are mapped to `0-127`.
        Pitch Wheel Name:
            The name of the pitch wheel channel.

    == Control ==

        Controller Name:
            The base name of the controller channels.
        Controller Format:
            Sends 7 or 14 bit controller events.
        Normalize:
            Maps channel values from different ranges to `0-127`.
        Program Change:
            The name of the program change channel.

    == Sys ==

        Bar Ramp Name:
            Clock ticks frequency is determined by the period of the
            ramp. The ramp must be `0` to `1`.
        Ticks Per Bar:
            The number of clock ticks per ramp.
        Send Start/Stop/Continue Events:
            Sends the appropriate events when the framebar starts or
            stops.
