Channel nodes create, filter, and manipulate channel data.

[Icon:NODEFLAGS/bypass] Bypass:
        Makes this node have no effect.
        
[Icon:NODEFLAGS/lock] Lock:
        Caches the input data and stops cooking the inputs to improve performance.
        
        NOTE:
                Locking a node that uses channels using __Current Frame__, will only keep a single time sample from the last evaluation. Locking a node that uses channels generated using a time range such as __Use Full Animation Range__ will cache the evaluation of the whole time range. It will evaluate properly when the time changes, but not if an input parameter or connection changes. 
        
[Icon:NODEFLAGS/export] Export:
        CHOP nodes cook a list of channel values for a single time of for a time range. Each channel has a name and most CHOP nodes also have a Export Prefix parameter. This is used to make a string representing an Export path. 
        
        When the Export flag is on, and if the Export path matches a parameter name, the value from the CHOP channel is exported on to the parameter value which overrides any channel animation, expression, or value. The normal parameter value evaluation is skipped.

[Icon:NODEFLAGS/audio] Audio:
        The Audio flag turns on CHOP node into an audio wave. Only one CHOP node within the whole scene can have the Audio Flag turned on.
        
        To play the audio, the Audio panel must also points to the CHOP node and it must be in scrub mode. You can visualize the CHOP audio wave in the [Animation Editor Graph View|/ref/panes/changraph] by turning on __Settings/Show Audio in Timeline__.
        
[Icon:NODEFLAGS/display] Graph:
        The Graph flag drives the displayed channel in the [Motion FX Viewer|/ref/views/chopview]. To display a channel in the Motion FX Viewer, its CHOP node needs to have the Graph Flag on and you must use the [Icon:BUTTONS/plus] or [Icon:BUTTONS/equal] buttons to adjust the channel name filters. 
        
        NOTE:
                The [Icon:BUTTONS/plus],[Icon:NODEFLAGS/xray], and [Icon:BUTTONS/equal] buttons on the bottom of the Motion FX Viewer also controls the Graph Flag.
