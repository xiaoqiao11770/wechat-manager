"""Used as a place-holder and does not have a function of its own."""

This CHOP is used as a place-holder and does not have a function of its
own. It is useful for tweaking data (using Edit Data Channels). It can
also be used as the final OP in a CHOP network for exporting. If an
unchanging OP like this is used to export, as your net changes you do
not need to keep switching the Export flag. This also helps when
fetching the result of a CHOP network from another network.
