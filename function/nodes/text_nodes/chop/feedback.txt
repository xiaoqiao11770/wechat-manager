"""Get the state of a chop as it was one frame or time slice ago."""

The Feedback CHOP allows you to get the state of a CHOP as it was one
frame or time slice ago. This allows you to connect CHOPs in circular
loops without incurring the dreaded 'Infinite Recursion' error, because
it simply copies its input without cooking it first.

POPs do this inherently, and some CHOPs like Lag and Filter look back in
time (iterate) internally to the chop, but sometimes the output of a
chain of CHOPs is needed as the input of the same chain one frame
later.

For example, if you need the position or speed of an object from a frame
ago in order to compute its position, displacement or speed at the
current frame, you would select a chop containing those values and feed
it into the Feedback CHOP. It will then output it a frame or time slice
later.

Since its input is not recooked, it must be forcibly updated by
following it with an exported CHOP to a displayed object.


@parameters

== Feedback ==

    Output:
        #channels: /output

        Specifies how the input should be copied.

        Previous Channels at Previous Time:
            All in the past.
        Previous Channels at Current Time:
            Some at current time.
        Last Sample at Current Time:
            Only last sample at current time.
    Delta Time:
        #channels: /delta

        If on, adds a `dt` channel whose value is the elapsed time since
        the last cook. It is expressed in units determined by the __Units__
        parameter of the Common page.
