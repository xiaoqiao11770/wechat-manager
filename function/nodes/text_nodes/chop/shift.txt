"""This time-shifts a CHOP, changing the start and end of the CHOP's interval."""

This time-shifts a CHOP, changing the start and end of the CHOP's interval. However, the contents of the channels remain the same.

Each channel can be shifted a different amount by using the `$C` variable in the __Scroll__ parameter.

An optional second input, the __Start/End__ Reference, is used to align the first input CHOP relative to another reference CHOP. This outputs the channels of the first CHOP only, and the shifts are based on the interval of the second CHOP. It is useful for making several CHOPs match
up to the same time.


@parameters

== Shift ==

    Reference:
        The start or the end of the channels can be used as the
        reference position. The channels are shifted by altering the
        reference position.

        Start Position:
            Uses the start of the CHOP to do the aligning.
        End Position:
            Uses the end of the CHOP to do the aligning.
    Unit Values:
        Determines how the __Start__ and __End__ parameters are are to be
        interpreted.

        Absolute:
            The __Start/End__ parameters are the actual start/end position.
            It is used to shift the CHOP to start at `0` seconds, for
            example.
        Relative to Start/End:
            The Start/End parameters are a shift relative to the input
            CHOP's start/end position.
        Use Current Frame:
            Ignore the start/end parameters and use the current frame as
            the new start position.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The start of the interval, absolute or relative to the input
        CHOP.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The end of the interval, absolute or relative to the input
        CHOP.
    Scroll Offset:
        #channels: /scroll

        The amount to shift the channel.
        
[Include:common]
    
@locals
    S:
        The start of the input clip, in samples.
    E:
        The end of the input clip, in samples.
    L:
        The length of the input clip, in samples.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1). 

	With this variable, channels can be shifted relative to one another.
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
