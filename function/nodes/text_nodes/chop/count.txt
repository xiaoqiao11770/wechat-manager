= Count =

"""Counts the number of times a channel crosses a trigger or release
threshold."""

This CHOP counts the number of times a channel crosses a trigger or
release threshold. It operates in either static or realtime ("Cook to
Current Frame") mode.

Crossing the trigger threshold (increasing past the trigger level)
creates a trigger event. Similarly, crossing the release threshold
(decreasing past the release level) creates a release event. Operations
may also be performed while the input remain above or below the trigger
or release levels. On each event, the count may be increased or
decreased by 1 or the time, or reset to zero. The time per sample varies
with the sample rate (i.e. for 100 samples/second, the time for each
sample would be 1/100th of a second).

The optional second input is a reset input. The first channel is
interpreted as a channel containing reset pulses. Whenever this channel
is non-zero, the count for all channels is reset.

This CHOP can be time sliced, and take advantage of Minimal Time Slice
Cooks.


@parameters

    == Trigger ==

        Release = Trigger Threshold:
            If on, the trigger threshold is also used as the release
            threshold.
        Trigger Threshold:
            #channels: /threshup

            The channel level that must be exceeded in order to trigger
            a count.
        Release Threshold:
            #channels: /threshdown

            A release count is triggered when the channel level drops
            below this threshold.
        Re-Trigger Delay:
            #channels: /retrigger

            The amount of time after a trigger point that a new trigger
            may occur.
        Trigger On:
            Determines whether a trigger occurs on an increasing slope
            or decreasing slope when passing the trigger threshold. A
            release will occur on the opposite slope.

    == Count ==

        Limit:
            The count can be clamped or looped between the limit minimum
            and maximum. Clamp will hold the count value at the
            maximum/minimum value if it goes above or below the limits.
            Loop will loop the count back between the limits by shifting
            the count to the maximum or minimum limit.
        Limit Minimum:
            #channels: /limitmin

            Minimum allowed count number.
        Limit Maximum:
            #channels: /limitmax

            Maximum allowed count number.
        Off To On:
            The operation to perform when a trigger event (off to on)
            occurs.
        While On:
            The operation to perform while the input remains triggered
            (on).
        On To Off:
            The operation to perform when a release event (on to off)
            occurs.
        While On:
            The operation to perform while the input is not triggered
            (off).
        Reset Count To Zero:
            In time slice mode, this resets the count for all channels.
