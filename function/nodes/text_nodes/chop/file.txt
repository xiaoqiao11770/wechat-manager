"""Reads in channel and audio files for use by chops."""

This CHOP reads in channel and audio files for use by CHOPs.

== Valid Formats ==

    The types of files that can be read into chops include:

    `.chan` :
        Raw ascii channel files; a row of numbers per frame.
    `.bchan` :
        Raw PRISMS/Houdini binary channel files.
    `.clip .bclip` :
        Houdini native CHOP clip files.
    `.bclipnc` :
        Houdini native non-commercial CHOP clip files.
    `.chn .bchn` :
        Houdini channel segment files.
    `.aif .aiff .au .sf .snd .wav .mp3` :
        Audio files.
    The same files can be output from the menu on the CHOP tile by
    selecting __Save Data Channels__. For a complete listing of all valid
    formats for CHOPs, see the _Formats_ section.

    == Other Input Devices ==

        For Midi files (.mid or .midi), see the [MIDI In
        CHOP|Node:chop/midiin]. Some other input devices, (e.g.
        Puppetworks) can be read with the [Pipe In
        CHOP|Node:chop/pipein].

        Users can extend the file formats that are read/written by the
        File chop through the chop _io_ and _CLIPio_ files in
        _$HFS/houdini_. Use the _clchan_ and _clchn_ programs as
        examples of the input/output needed.

== File ==

    Channel File:
        The name of the file to load. The button beside the string field
        brings up a file browser.
    Name Options:
        Allows you to change the way the channels are named.

        Use Names In File:
            Uses the channel names stored in the file. If the format

            chan2, etc. is used.
        Use New Names:
            The channel names are manually specified by the name
            parameter below.
        Use Filename:
            The filename, minus the extension and path, is used. If more
            than 1 channel is in the file, the channels will be numbered
            to keep the names unique.
    Name:
        The new name(s) of the file's channels.
    Rate Options:
        Allows you to change the sample rate of the file.

            Change the file's sample rate to a new rate.
        Resample:
            Change the file's sample rate to a new rate and keep the
            time range constant.
    Sample Rate:
        #channels: /rate

        The new sample rate to use if Override or Resample is selected.
    Extend Left:
        The extend condition before the channel's beginning.
    Extend Right:
        The extend condition after the channel's ending.
