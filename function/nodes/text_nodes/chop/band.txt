"""A 14-band equalizer which filters audio input channels in the same way that a conventional band equalizer uses a bank of sliders to filter fixed-frequency bands of sound."""

This CHOP is a 14-band equalizer which filters audio input channels in
the same way that a conventional band equalizer uses a bank of sliders
to filter fixed-frequency bands of sound.

The CHOP has 14 bands from 10Hz to 82kHz with one parameter per band.
The 20Hz band ranges from 14 Hz to 28 Hz (1 octave centered at 20Hz).
These bands may be be all shifted up or down in frequency with the __Base
Shift__ parameter. The shape of each band filter may also be specified as
a Gaussian filter (smooth falloff, where the bands overlap) or a Box
filter (sharp cutoff, where the bands don't overlap).

The first input contains the channels to be filtered.

The second input contains optional channels called Filter Animation
Channels, that override the frequency parameters of the CHOP. They
replace the control channels in the CHOP dialog box (b10, b20...), and
can be used to animate the filter parameters over the interval of the
CHOP. To override a parameter with an Filter Animation Channel, it must
have the exact same name as the parameter's channel. To control the 40Hz
band, the channel in the second input must be named "b40".

Filter Animation Channels are evaluated at the beginning of every Filter
Chunk that is processed. As the chunk size decreases, the rate at which
your parameters can change increases, but the low frequency sound
quality degrades. The first input and the second input should have the
same start-end interval.

This CHOP can be time sliced to operate on audio in realtime.


@parameters

    == Low ==

        Base Shift:
            #channels: /base

            The number of octaves to shift the bands up (positive
            values) or down (negative values). Each octave shifted up
            doubles each of the bands' frequencies.
        Filter Shape:
            Selects the band filter type to use. Gaussian produces a
            smooth filter, while Box produces a very sharp filter.
        10, 20, 40:
            10, 20 and 40 Hz bands. /b10, b20, b40
        80, 160, 320:
            80, 160 and 320 Hz bands. /b80, b160, b320

    == High ==

        640, 1K:
            640 Hz and 1.28 kHz bands. /b640, b1k
        2K, 5K, 10K:
            2.56, 5.12, 10.24 kHz bands. /b2k, b5k, b10k
        20K, 41K, 82K:
            20.48, 40.96, 81.92 kHz bands. /b20k, b41k, b82k

    == Digital ==

        Filter Chunk:
            The size of the chunk that is processed at one time, in
            samples.
        Chunk Overlap:
            #channels: /overlap

            The portion of the chunk to overlap with the previous one.
        Chunk Discard:
            #channels: /discard

            The portion of the chunk to discard.
