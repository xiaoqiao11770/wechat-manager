= Wave =

"""Creates a waveform that is repeated."""

This CHOP produces a variety of waveforms. On top of the actual
waveform, an offset, decay and ramp can be applied.

Multiple channels can be generated by using patterns in the __Channel
Name__ parameter. A few examples of name pattern
generation:

{{{
tx ty tz             tx ty tz
t[xyz]               tx ty tz
chan[1-4]            chan1 chan2 chan3 chan4
c[xyz][1-3:2,15]     cx1 cy1 cz1 cx3 cy3 cz3 cx15 cy15 cz15
}}}

These parameters are applied in the following order: __Offset__, __Amplitude__,
__Decay__, __Ramp__, and __Expression__.


@parameters

    == Waveform ==

        Type:
            The wave type which is one of the following:

            Constant:
                A constant valued "wave".
            Sine:
                A sine wave.
            Gaussian:
                A Gaussian wave (also known as bell or normal curve).
            Triangle:
                A triangular sawtooth wave.
            Square:
                A square wave.
            Pulse:
                A periodic one-sample pulse wave.
            Expression:
                A user defined non-periodic expression.
        Period:
            #channels: /period

            The period of the wave.
        Phase:
            #channels: /phase

            The phase of the wave, from `0` to `1`.
        Bias:
            #channels: /bias

            The bias of the waveform. Only Gaussian, triangle and square
            waves have biases.
        Offset:
            #channels: /offset

            The value offset of the waveform.
        Amplitude:
            #channels: /amp

            The amplitude of the waveform.
        Decay Rate:
            #channels: /decay

            The decay rate of the waveform, represented as the fraction
            of decay after `1` Unit of time (default is one second)
        Ramp Slope:
            #channels: /ramp

            A ramp is added the wave: amount per Unit of time.
        Expression:
            #channels: /exprs

            Expression to use for "Expression" Type.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Name:
            The names of the channels to create. Patterns like
            `chan[1-20]` generate multiple channels.
        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the current global animation range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range using the Start/End parameters.
        Start, End:
            #channels: /start /end

            The start time of the channels.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the channels.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for extend conditions.
            
    [Include:common]

        The current index.
    L:
        The current loop index, which is reset every period.
    N:
        The current period count, starting at zero.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
    P:
        The period of the wave (from the Period parameter).
