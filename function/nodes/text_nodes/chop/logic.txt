"""Converts channels of all its input chops into binary channels and combines them using a variety of logic operations."""

This CHOP converts channels of all its input chops into binary channels
and combines them using a variety of logic operations. `0` is considered
off, and `1` is on.

== Result of Channel and CHOP input Operations ==

@parameters

    == Logic ==

        Convert Input:
            The method to convert inputs to binary on/off.

            Off When Zero:
                zero->0, non-zero->1
            Off When Zero Or Less:
                negative or zero->0, positive->1
        Channel Pre OP:
            Unary operations can be applied to each channel.
        Combine Channels:
            Operation applied between channels within each input.
        Combine CHOPs:
            Operation applied between corresponding channels of multiple
            inputs.
        Match By:
            Channels matched between inputs by number or index.
        Align:
            Inputs that don't start at same frame can be aligned.

    == Script ==

        Off To On:
            The script executed when an output channel switches from off
            to on, called at the first "on" frame. You can use variables
            like $C and $I in the command.
        While On:
            The script executed when an output channel is on. Called
            once per channel that is on, each frame.
        On To Off:
            The script executed when an output channel switches from on
            to off, called at the first "off" frame.
        While Off:
            The script executed when an output channel is off. Called
            once per channel that is off, each frame.
            
    [Include:common]
            
@locals
    V:
        The current value.
    I:
        The current index.
    C:
        the current channel (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        the total number of channels.
