= Spring =

"""Creates vibrations influenced by the input channels, as if a mass was attached to a spring."""

This CHOP creates vibrations influenced by the input channels, as if a mass was attached to a spring.

It acts as if, for every channel, there is a mass at the end of a spring, affected by a distance from the actual position (the output of the channel at the previous frame) to the desired position (the input channel at the current frame). When the distance (output - input) is zero, there is no force and therefore no movement.

Alternately, when __Input Effect__ is force, the input is used as a force on the spring/mass, and the CHOP reacts to this force plus the force of the spring/mass. In this case, the mass would always stabilize at value `0` if the input is a force of `0`.

The __Damping__ acts to make the spring system lose energy, so that higher damping makes everything come to rest sooner.

Its behavior is best understood by feeding it a CHOP that steps from one constant value to another in sequence, then playing with the constants.


@parameters

== Spring ==

    Spring Constant:
        #channels: /springk

        A number describing how strong the spring is. Larger spring
        constants produce higher frequency oscillations.
    Mass:
        #channels: /mass

        The mass of the object on the end of the spring. Higher masses
        will produce lower frequency oscillations, have higher
        amplitudes, and be more resistant to damping.
    Damping Constant:
        #channels: /dampingk

        The amount of damping (resistance) applied to the spring action.
        Higher damping causes oscillations to die off more quickly.
    Input Effect:
        Determines whether the input channel(s) represents a position or
        a force.
    Initial Conditions From Channel:
        If on, the initial position and velocity are calculated from
        the values at the beginning of the channel.
    Initial Position:
        #channels: /initpos

        The initial position of the mass attached to the spring.
    Initial Speed:
        #channels: /initspeed

        The initial velocity of the mass attached to the spring.
