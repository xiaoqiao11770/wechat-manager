"""Manually tap the beat of a piece of music, and automatically
generate a repeating ramp or pulse that continues to
keep time with the music after the taps stop."""

This realtime chop is used to manually tap the beat of a piece of music,
and automatically generate a repeating ramp or pulse that continues to
keep time with the music after the taps stop.

The CHOP computes the length of time (the period) of a beat. It can
output five channels: a ramp from 0 to 1, a beat pulse, a beat count,
and a constant channel containing the period.

The input must contain two channels, a Listen channel followed by a Tap
channel. Often these channels are just two on/off keys on the computer
keyboard (from the Keyboard chop), or two keys on a MIDI keyboard (from
the Midi In chop). "On" must be greater than zero, and "off" must be
zero or less.

When the Listen channel goes on, it means that you desire to change
the tempo, and the CHOP is ready to record the user's taps. After Listen
goes on, the first tap on the Tap channel changes the output. A time
slice or frame is output at the current frame, containing the beat
information.

The next taps change the period of the beat, which is the length of the
chop. The beat period is computed by taking the average time between
taps. While the Listen channel is off, the output of the chop does not
change.

If the Beat channel pulses are longer than one frame, only the time of
the first sample matters.

To produce multiples of the tempo (double, half, quarter, etc.), use the
Tempo Scale menus to select a range of tempos. Tempos from 1/8th to 8x
the tapped tempo can be produced.

Hit the Tap channel at any time to synch the ramp to start at the
current frame.


@parameters

    == Beat ==

        Lower/Upper Tempo Scale:
            Allows a range of beat channels from 1/8th of the input
            tempo to 8x the tempo.
        Output:
            Beat outputs either a time slice or one frame.
        Synch Beat:
            Resets the ramp on all taps, the first tap, or none.
        Grace Period:
            If a tap occurs close to a beat, do not reset the ramp if
            within the grace period. The units are based on ramp values;
            0.1 means a grace period of ramp values above 0.9 and less
            than 0.1.

    == Channel ==

        Timer Ramp Name:
            This channel is a ramp from 0 to 1. The position within the
            beat cycle is represented as a value from 0 (start of beat)
            to 1 (end of beat).
        Timer Pulse Name:
            This channel outputs a 1-sample pulse at the start of the
            ramp cycle.
        Cycle Count Name:
            This channel counts the number of beats since the first tap.
            Re-synching the beat will reset this count to zero.
        Period Name:
            The name of the channel which contains the value of the
            period. Depending on the "Units" parameter in the Common
            page, it will be in Seconds, Frames or Samples.
        Period Start Name:
            The name of the channel which contains the start
            sample/frame/time of the current ramp.
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /rate

            The sample rate of the output channels.
