= Spectrum =

"""Calculates the frequency spectrum of the input channels, or a portion
of the channels."""

This CHOP calculates the frequency spectrum of the input channels, or a
portion of the channels. The spectrum can be manipulated and then
converted back to get a filtered signal.

When converting a signal to its spectrum, two channels are created from
the one containing the signal. One channel contains the magnitude of the
frequency components, and the other contains the phase. The channels are
named _<channel name><suffix>_, where _<suffix>_ is the magnitude or
phase suffix.

In order to convert back to a signal, both channels are required. The
suffixes should be the same as those used in the previous spectrum
CHOP.


@parameters

== Spectrum ==

    Convert:
        Determines whether to calculate the frequency spectrum from a
        signal, or reconstruct a signal from a frequency spectrum.
    Analyze Segment:
        If on, only a small segment of the channel is analyzed. If off,
        the spectrum is computed from the entire channel.
    Unit Values:
        Determines how Start/End parameters are interpreted.

        Absolute:
            The segment is the start/end values.
        Relative to Start/End:
            The segment is a shift from the old positions of the input's
            start/end.
        Relative to Current Frame:
            The segment is a shift from the current frame.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        Determines the start of the segment to be analyzed (in Units).
    End:
        #channels: /end

        Determines the end of the segment to be analyzed (in Units).
    Magnitude Suffix:
        When converting to a spectrum, the string appended to the
        channel name that identifies the channel as containing
        magnitudes.
    Phase Suffix:
        Similar to Magnitude Suffix, but for phase channels.
