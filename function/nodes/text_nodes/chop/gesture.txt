= Gesture =


Gesture records a short segment of the first input and loops this
segment in time with beats from the third input. The second input
defines the "listen" input.

When the first channel of the listen input goes above zero, the Gesture
CHOP begins recording the first input's channels. While listen is on,
the input channels are output exactly as is. When the listen is turned
off, the recorded segment of the channels is processed (trimmed and
blended). While listen is off, the recorded segment is looped
continuously.

The beat input should be a single periodic 0-1 ramp channel similar to
the ones produced by the Beat and MIDI In CHOPs. The listen channel
should be a single 0-1 on/off channel (ie, Keyboard or Logic CHOP).

The Gesture CHOP determines the number of beats that the listen was on
for; this defines the period of the loop. If the beat frequency changes,
the period will change with it.

The beat input is optional if the __Fit Method__ is set to 'None'. In this
case, the recorded segment will be looped back with a period equal to
the recorded length.

There are no local variables.


@parameters

== Gesture ==

    Fit Method:
        Determines how to fit the recorded segment to the beats.

        None:
            The beats are not used. The full segment is recorded and
            looped.
        Stretch To Beats:
            The full segment is recorded and stretched to the beat
            period.
        Trim To Beats:
            The closest beats to the start and end of the segment are
            selected, and the segment is trimmed, shifted or
            interpolated to fill the interval.
    Fit To Beat:
        The number of beats that the recorded segment spans can be
        automatically determined or fixed at a constant value.

        Auto Fit:
            Fits to the closest number of beats.
        Auto Fit to Multiple of Beats:
            Fits to the closest number of beats, as long as they are a
            multiple of the 'Number Of Beats' parameter. (ie. for 2:
            2,4,6,8,10,...)
        Auto Fit to Power of 2 Beats:
            Fits to the closest number of beats that is a power of 2
            (2,4,8,16,32...)
        Fit to Fixed Number of Beats:
            Fit to the a fixed number of beats, specified below.
    Number Of Beats:
        #channels: /numbeats

        The fixed number of beats to fit the recorded segment to.
    Blend Region:
        #channels: /blend

        How much of the recorded segment to use as a blend region. The
        blend region is used to blend the beginning of the segment to
        the end so that a seamless loop is produced.
    Listen Blend:
        #channels: /lblend

        When listen is turned on or off, jumps can occur. This blend
        region smooths them out.
    Interpolate Samples:
        If on, recorded samples are interpolated when scaling occurs,
        otherwise the nearest sample is selected.
