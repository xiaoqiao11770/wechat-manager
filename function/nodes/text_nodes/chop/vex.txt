= VEX CHOP =

"""References a VEX program that can manipulate channel data."""

This node references a (textual) VEX program which can use
[CHOP context |/vex/contexts/chop] [VEX functions|/vex/functions] to
manipulate channel data. (To define a VOP network instead of a VEX program,
use the [VOP CHOP|Node:chop/vopchop] instead.)

@parameters

VEX Script:
    Path to the _compiled_ VEX program. You must use [vcc|/vex/vcc] to
    compile your source code and point this node to the compiled file.
    
Reload VEX functions:
    Reloads the referenced compiled VEX file.

Align:
    The alignment option to use.

    Extend to Min/Max:
	Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all
	inputs to that range using the extend conditions.
    Stretch to Min/Max:
	Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every
	channel's start and end to that range.
    Shift to Minimum:
	Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all
	start at that index. All channels are extended to the length
	of the longest one.
    Shift to Maximum:
	Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end
	at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the
	longest one.
    Shift to First Interval:
	Shift all channels to the start of the first channel and
	sample all inputs using the first input's range.
    Trim to First Interval:
	Trim all channels to first channel's range.
    Stretch to First Interval:
	Stretch all channels to the first channel's range.
    Trim to Smallest Interval:
	Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
	start and end values may not come from the same channel.
    Stretch to Smallest Interval:
	Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
	start and end values may not come from the same channel.
