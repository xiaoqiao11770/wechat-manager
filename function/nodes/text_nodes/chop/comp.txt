"""Layers (blends) the channels of one CHOP on the channels of another CHOP."""

This CHOP layers (blends) the channels of one CHOP on the channels of
another CHOP. The first input is the base input and the second is the
layer input.

Over the interval of the layer, the layer channels are blended with the
base channels. The contribution of the layer is eased-in and eased-out
according to the __Start__, __Peak__, __Release__ and __End__ parameters. The base is
unaffected outside the interval of the layer.

The __Effect__ parameter determines the amount of contribution of the
layer.

If __Base Hold__ is 0, the layer input will completely replace the base
input when the effect is 1. If Base Hold is 1, the layer will be added
to the base.

The interval of the output starts at the minimum of the base and layer.
The interval of the output ends at the maximum of the base and layer.
The base's extend conditions are used if the layer lies outside the
base.

If the third input is supplied, the Effect page will be overridden by
the third input's first channel, which should contain the effect values
over the range of the layer.


@parameters

    == Composite ==

        Base Hold:
            #channels: /base

            Determines how much of the base to blend into the output at
            points where the layer has an effect.
        Match By:
            Matches channels in the base input with ones in the layer
            input by either index or name. Channel Union causes layer
            channels that are not in the base to be added to the
            output.
        Quaternion Blend:
            Aids in producing smooth rotation blending. The "quaternion"
            attribute should be in the input CHOP. See the Attribute
            CHOP.
        Shortest Path Rotation Blending:
            If on, compensate for cyclic channels (such as angles) by
            always choosing the shortest route between samples when
            blending.
        Rotation Scope:
            Defines which channels are rotations for Shortest Path
            Rotation Blending.
        Cycle Length:
            #channels: /cyclelen

            The length of the cycle for Shortest Path Rotation
            Blending.

    == Effect ==

        Effect:
            #channels: /effect

            Sets how much the layer affects the output. If 0, the output
            is the base.
        Unit Values:
            Sets the meaning of the next four parameters - either
            absolute values, relative to the start/end of the channel,
            or relative to the current frame. The layer and base are
            never shifted.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The beginning of the composite interval. Effect is zero at
            this point.
        Peak:
            #channels: /peak

            Where the composite operation reaches maximum effect. This
            value is held until the release point.
        Release:
            #channels: /release

            The point at which the effect begins to fall back towards
            zero.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end of the composite operation's effect. The effect
            reduces to zero again.
        Rise/Fall Shape:
            The shape of the segment between the Start and Peak indices,
            or between Release and End.
            
    [Include:common]

@locals
    C:
        The current channel index (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
