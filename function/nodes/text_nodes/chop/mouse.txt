"""Outputs X and Y screen values for the mouse device."""

This CHOP outputs X and Y screen values for the mouse device.

The Mouse X and Y positions are output through the channels named in the
Position X and Y parameters, when the Active button is enabled.

The range of the mouse values are `-1` to `+1` in X, and `-0.8` to `+0.8` in Y.
`0, 0` is the center of the screen.

The Mouse and [Keyboard|keyboard] CHOPs are often connected to the Position and
Active inputs respectively of the Record CHOP to enable the recording of
channels generated by the Keyboard and Mouse.

    == Control ==

        Active:
            While on, the mouse movement will be output from the CHOP,
            and the CHOP will cook every frame. Otherwise the CHOP will
            not cook and the current mouse X or Y values will not be
            output.
        Position X:
            The name of the channel that records the horizontal movement
            of the mouse.
        Position Y:
            The name of the channel that records the vertical movement
            of the mouse.
        Use Tablet:
            If enabled, and a tablet is connect to the system, the
            current parameters of the stylus will be reported.
        Pressure:
            How hard the stylus is pressing on the tablet. A value of `0`
            represents no pressure, while `1` is maximum pressure.
        Angle:
            The direction the stylus is facing on the tablet. If the
            stylus tip is facing the top of the tablet, it is `0`. If
            facing the right side, it is `90`.
        Tilt:
            The angle off the horizontal of the stylus. A value `0` means
            the stylus is lying flat. A value of `90` means the stylus is
            pointing straight down. Negative values mean the stylus is
            reversed.
        Roll:
            The angle to which the stylus is twisted about its own
            length. Again, a value from `0-360` in degrees.
        Cursor:
            Which tool is currently active. `0` means a mouse-like device,
            `1` means a pen, and `2` means an eraser.
