= Object =

"""Compares two objects and returns information on their relative
positions and orientations."""

The Object CHOP compares two objects and returns information on their
relative positions and orientations. The information that can be output
is:

* Position of one object relative to another.

* Rotation of one object relative to another.

* Bearing of one object relative to another.

* Single Bearing Angle between two objects.

* Distance between the origin of two objects.

* Inverse Square of the Distance between two objects.

The optional two inputs allow you to compare X,Y,Z points in world space
with objects or each other. The inputs are expected to have three
channels containing XYZ points. These inputs replace the target and/or
reference objects. Object and points can be compared with each other,
but "Rotation" mode will always return zero.

If either the target or reference objects (but not both) are missing, then the
identity transform is used in place. This allows us to obtain the world
transform of an object by only supplying a target object, or to obtain the
inverse world transform of an object by only supplying the reference object.


@parameters

    == Object ==

        Target Object:
            The object that is being compared to the reference object.
        Name:
            Specify the target using a string.
        Reference Object:
            The object that acts as the basis for the comparison.
        Name:
            Specify the reference using a string.
	Use Reference Bone Length:
	    If enabled and the __Reference Object__ is a [Node:obj/bone]
	    object, then the reference transform at the end of the bone will
	    be used instead of at the beginning of the bone.
        Compute:
            The information to output from the objects, as listed
            above.
        Rotate Order:
            The rotation order to use for "Rotation" or "Bearing"
            computation.
        Bearing Reference:
            Bearing requires a direction to use as a reference base.
        Bearing Vector:
            An arbitrary base direction for /bearing x y z the bearing
            calculation.
        Point Scope:
            When one of the optional point inputs is connected, this
            determines which channels represent X, Y and Z.

    == Channel ==

        Channel Names:
            Sets how the output channels are named. A : is placed in the
            channel name where / is in the path.

            Channel Name:
                Only use the name of the channel.
            Target and Channel Names:
                Include the name of the target with the channel name,
                separated by a colon (:).
            Reference and Channel Names:
                Include the name of the reference with the channel name,
                separated by a colon (:).
        Sample Rate:
            #channels: /samplerate

            The sampling rate of the channel in frames per second (Hz).
        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to fetch.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the animated range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range below.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The start time of the desired interval of the object path.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end time of the desired interval of the object path.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for extend conditions.
