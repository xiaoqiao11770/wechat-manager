= Trim =

"""Shortens or lengthens the input's channels."""

This CHOP shortens or lengthens the input's channels. A part of the interval can be preserved or removed. If the channels are being lengthened, the extend conditions of the channel will be used to get the new values.

The handles on the Trim CHOP in the graph can adjust its length.


@parameters

== Trim ==

    Unit Values:
        Determines whether the __Start/End__ parameters are absolute numbers
        or numbers that are relative to the start and end of the input
        channels.

        Absolute:
            The __Start__ or __End__ are the actual numbers defining the new
            interval.
        Relative to Start/End:
            The __Start__ and __End__ parameters are relative to the start and
            end of the input CHOP.
        Relative to Current Frame:
            Start and end parameters are computed relative to the
            current frame.
        Current Time Slice:
            The current time slice is trimmed out.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The start of the range to trim.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The end of the range to trim.
    Discard:
        Which part of the channel to discard.

        Exterior:
            Discard those parts of the channel outside the trim range.
        Interior:
            Discard the interior of the trim range. If two intervals
            remain, sequence them together.
