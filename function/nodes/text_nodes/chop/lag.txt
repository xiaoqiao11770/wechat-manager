= Lag =

"""Adds lag and overshoot to channels."""

This CHOP adds lag and overshoot to channels. It can also limit the
velocity and acceleration of channels. Lag is an effect that slows down
rapid changes in the input channels. __Overshoot__ amplifies the changes in
the input channels.

Two values exist for each parameter. For example, in the Lag effect,
when the input channel value is rising, the first lag parameter is used,
and when the channel value is decreasing, the second lag parameter is
used. This can give a quick rise, and a slow fall. But lag up and down
are often kept at the same value.

The [Spring CHOP|Node:chop/spring] provides some similar effects.

@parameters

== Lag ==

    Method:
        The method by which lag is applied to the channels.

        Lag Value:
            Up is defined as an increase in values of the input
            channels, and down is a decrease in values of the inputs.
        Lag Amplitude:
            Up is defined as an increase in amplitude (moving away from
            zero) and down is defined as a decrease in amplitude (moving
            towards zero) of each input channel.
        Lag Magnitude:
            All the input channels are treated as components of one
            vector, and each operation is applied to the vector as a
            whole. Only the first parameter in __Lag__, __Overshoot__, __Clamp
            Slope__ and __Clamp Acceleration__ applies in this mode.
    Lag:
        #channels: /lag1 /lag2

        Applies a lag to a channel. The first value is for lagging up,
        and the second is for lagging down. It is approximately the time
        that the output follows 90% of a change to the input.
    Overshoot:
        #channels: /overshoot1 /overshoot2

        Applies overshoot to a channel. The first value is for
        overshoot while moving up, and the second is for overshoot while
        moving down.
    Clamp Slope:
        Clamps the slope (or velocity) to lie between the values listed
        in "Max Slope" below. Slope is expressed as value/Units.
    Max Slope:
        #channels: /slope1 /slope2

        The first value limits the slope when it is rising, and the
        second value limits the slope when it is decreasing.
    Clamp Acceleration:
        Clamps the acceleration to lie between the values listed in "Max
        Acceleration" below. Acceleration is expressed as
        value/(Units*2)
    Max Acceleration:
        #channels: /accel1 /accel2

        The first value limits the acceleration when it is rising, and
        the second value limits the acceleration when it is decreasing.
