"""Creates cycles."""

This CHOP creates cycles. It can repeat the channels any number of times
before and after the original. It can also make a single cycle have a
smooth transition from its end to its beginning, so it loops smoothly.

Since channels may not naturally loop well, the Cycle CHOP provides
three different methods of blending between the cycles.


@parameters

    == Cycle ==

        Cycles Before:
            #channels: /before

            The number of cycles to loop before the input CHOP. This
            parameter can be fractional.
        Cycles After:
            #channels: /after

            The number of cycles to loop after the input CHOP. This
            parameter can be fractional.
        Mirror Cycles:
            If on, consecutive cycles are mirror images (reversed) of
            one another. The first cycle is never mirrored.
        Blend Start to End:
            If on, the end of the CHOP is blended into the start of the
            CHOP to produce a smooth loop. If Cycles Before and Cycles
            After are 0, Region is non-zero, and Extend Conditions are
            "Cycle", it loops smoothly forever.

    == Blend ==

        Method:
            How to blend between cycles.

            Preserve Length:
                Keeps the total length of each cycle the same as the
                length of the input CHOP.
            Overlap Sequences:
                Overlaps each cycle with with the previous cycle.
            Insert Blend Region:
                Inserts a region between the cycles where blending is
                done.
        Shape:
            The shape of the blending function.

            Linear:
                Linear shape.
            Ease in:
                Smooth on entry.
            Ease out:
                Smooth on exit.
            Ease in Ease out:
                Smooth on entry and exit.
            Cubic:
                For Insert Blend Region, cubic interpolation fills the
                region between the cycles.
            Add:
                The overlapped region has the overlapping samples simply
                added.
        Region:
            #channels: /blendregion

            The size of the blend region, in either seconds, samples or
            frames (set in "Units" in the Common page).
        Bias:
            #channels: /bias

            The bias of the blend. -1 biases the blend toward the
            beginning, 0 is no bias and +1 biases towards the end.
        Step:
            #channels: /step

            If set to 1, the next cycle will be shifted in value up or
            down so that it begins where the last cycle ended. Suitable
            for root object of walk cycles.
        Step Scope:
            The names of those channels that will be affected by the
            __Step__ parameter.
