"""Reorganizes a list of channels."""

This CHOP reorganizes a list of channels. It is extremely useful for
transforming data received by the [Geometry CHOP|geometry] and [Image CHOP|image] into channels
containing only one row or column. Data can be easily manipulated, then
transformed back if needed.


@parameters

== Shuffle ==

    Shuffle Operation:
        Chooses the operation shuffle performs.

        Swap Channels and Samples:
            Performs a channel transpose operation, by storing all
            samples at the same index in the same channel. If 25
            channels are in the CHOP with a length of 33 samples, 33
            channels will be created with a length of 25.
        Sequence Channels By Name:
            Sequence channels together that share the same alphabetic
            name, in the order of their number. (ie. chan2, chan3 and
            chan1 would be sequenced in the order chan1, chan2, chan3).
        Sequence All Channels:
            Sequence all channels in the clip.
        Sequence N Channels:
            Sequence channels in groups of N together. For N=4, channels
            0 to 3, 4 to 7, etc. will be sequenced.
        Sequence Every Nth Channel:
            Sequence every Nth channel together. For N=4, channels
            0,4,8,.., 1,5,9,..., etc. will be sequenced.
        Split All Samples:
            Split every channel into channels of 1 sample, each
            containing a different sample from the original channel.
        Split N Samples:
            Split each channel into segments of N samples (specified
            below).
        Split Every Nth Sample:
            Take every Nth sample from the original to form N new
            channels.
    Channel Names:
        The new name(s) of the channels after a "Swap Channels and
        Samples" operation.
    N Value:
        #channels: /nval

        The value of N for Sequence Every Nth Channel, Sequence N
        Channels, Split N Samples and Split Every Nth Sample.
