"""Produces multiple copies of the second input along the timeline of the first input."""

This CHOP produces multiple copies of the second input along the
timeline of the first input. The first input provides the trigger
signals or the convolve levels.

The Copy CHOP can be used to produce a motion every time a trigger
occurs. It can be used to trigger motion, such as eyelid blinks. The
copies it produces can be identical, or the copies can be re-cooked each
time a copy is added to the timeline. It is useful for triggering a
sound multiple times, where the sounds may overlap in time.

Each copy that is added to the output can be completely different than
any other copy. By passing variables through the Variables page, the
second (Copy) input can be any chop chain that uses the variables and
recooks to create each copy.


@parameters

    == Copy ==

        Copy Method:
            Method used for the copy operation.

            Triggered Copy:
                The second input is copied (convolved) over the first
                input's trigger points only. A trigger point occurs
                whenever the first input's channel crosses the __Trigger
                Threshold__ value. Overlapping copies are added.
            Convolve:
                For every sample in the first input's channel, the
                second input is shifted to that point in time, scaled by
                the sample value, and added into the output channels.
        Output Method:
            How to output the channels

            One Channel Per Template Channel:
                Each output channel is a channel from the first input
                combined with the corresponding channel from the second
                input.
            One Channel Per Copy Channel:
                Each output channel is a channel from the second input,
                with copies triggered by every channel of the first
                input.
        Trigger Threshold:
            #channels: /threshold

            The threshold value for triggering copies.
        Remainder:
            What to do with remaining samples at end of the interval.

            Discard Remainder:
                Output interval = input interval.
            Make Output Longer:
                Output is longer if envelope unfinished.
            Mix Remainder to Beginning:
                Add remainder to samples at the start.
        Keep Non-Scoped Channels:
            If on, non-scoped channels are copied to the output,
            otherwise they are deleted.

    == Variables ==

        Cook Each Copy:
            Recook the second input for each triggered copy.
        Param 1-10:
            The parameters are re-calculated for each copy. The first
            field is the parameter name, the second is its value. You
            can use local variables and the ic() functions. The
            parameters you set here are available to any CHOP in the
            network attached to the second input through function
            param("name", initval), where initval is any initial value
            for the parameter, usually set to 0.
            
    [Include:common]

@locals
    I:
        The current index.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1).
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
    V:
        The value at the current index of the current channel.
    CN:
        The copy number. (The first thing it copies is 0.)
