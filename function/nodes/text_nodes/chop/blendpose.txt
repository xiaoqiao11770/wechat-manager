"""Performs multi-dimensional, example-based interpolation of
channels."""

This CHOP performs channel interpolation using an example-based method.
Each example is taken from the pair of samples provided from the source
and input channels. The data from the first input is then interpolated
such that (as much as possible), the the target values will be obtained
if the input values match the source values.

The first input specifies the channels used for the interpolation.

The second input specifies the source channels. This must contain the
same number of channels as the first input.

The third input specifies the target channels. Each sample here is
paired with the corresponding sample in the source channel. Thus, the
length in samples of this input must matched with the second input.
However, a different number of channels from the second input is
allowed.


@parameters

    == Fit ==

        Interpolant:
            Interpolation method.

            Radial Basis Functions:
                This class of interpolants provide smooth results that
                will likely match the example data.
            Hyperplane:
                This interpolant will create a plane of best fit. The
                results will likely not match the example data.
        Clamp Input:
            If enabled, this will clamp the input data to the
            corresponding value range of the source input before
            interpolating.
        Best Fit Extrapolation:
            If enabled, a best fit method will be used for the
            extrapolation of data outside of the source inputs.
        Maximize Best Fit:
            This option is only used when Best Fit Extrapolation is enabled.
            Turning this on will first maximize the interpolation using the
            plane of best fit, and then interpolate the remaining differences
            using the radial basis functions. This gives closer fits to the
            hyperplane method especially for kernel functions that specify a
            falloff. For those kernel functions, turning this option will also
            result in faster cooking. This option can give better results when
            there is high spatial correlation in the examples.
        Kernel:
            This specifies the kernel function used for the Radial Basis
            Functions interpolant. Different kernel functions will
            result in varying fits.
        Exponent:
            Specifies the exponent used for the Thin Plate kernal
            function. Larger values will give smoother results.
        Fall Off:
            Specifies the fall off factor for the Gaussian,
	    Multiquadric, Inverse Multiquadric, and Exponential Bump kernel
	    functions.
            Larger values will give smoother results.
        Solver:
            Specifies the solver method used for the interpolation.

            Cholesky:
                The Cholesky solver is faster but not as stable.
            SVD:
                The SVD solver is slower but will produce the higher
                quality interpolations.
        Damping:
            Specifies the damping used for the Cholesky solver. This is
            normally not needed unless the solver is failing. In that
            case, start with a very small damping value like 0.00001 for
            example. Then use successively larger values like 0.0001,
            0.001, 0.01, etc. until the solver succeeds.
        Maximum Iterations:
            Specifies the maximum number of iterations that the SVD
            solver performs. If the SVD solver fails, then increase this
            value until the solver succeeds.
