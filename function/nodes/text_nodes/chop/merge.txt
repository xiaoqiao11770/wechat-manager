= Merge =

"""Takes multiple inputs and merges them into the output."""

This CHOP takes multiple inputs and merges them into the output. All the
channels of the input appear in the output. The channel order is the
channels of the first input followed by the channels of the second
input, and so on.

Channel names may conflict, but a channel is renamed according to the
_Duplicate Names_ menu.


@parameters

== Merge ==

    Align:
        The alignment option to use.

        Extend to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all
            inputs to that range using the extend conditions.
        Stretch to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every
            channel's start and end to that range.
        Shift to Minimum:
            Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all
            start at that index. All channels are extended to the length
            of the longest one.
        Shift to Maximum:
            Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end
            at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the
            longest one.
        Shift to First Interval:
            Shift all channels to the start of the first channel and
            sample all inputs using the first input's range.
        Trim to First Interval:
            Trim all channels to first channel's range.
        Stretch to First Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the first channel's range.
        Trim to Smallest Interval:
            Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
        Stretch to Smallest Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
    Duplicate Names:
        What to do when channels of input CHOPs have same name.

        Unique Names:
            Include all input channels, make conflict names unique.
        Keep First:
            Include only channel of the first CHOP name appears in.
        Keep Last:
            Include only channel of the last CHOP name appears in.
