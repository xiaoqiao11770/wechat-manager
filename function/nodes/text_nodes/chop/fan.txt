"""Used for controlling other CHOPs."""

This CHOP is used for controlling other CHOPs. Its first operation, "Fan
Out", selects one of N output channels based on the input channel's
value. A selected output has a value of 1, and all non-selected outputs
have a value of 0. The selection is done by index; the first output
channel is index value 0, the second, 1, and so on. If the input value
is above N-1 or below 0, the value can be clamped, cycled or ignored.

For example, if the value of the input channel at a certain frame is 4
and the CHOP outputs 8 channels, channel 5 will have a value of 1, and
all other channels will have a zero value at that frame.

The input is assumed to have 1 channel which contains integer values;
fractions are truncated and extra channels are ignored. The output
channels are binary (0 or 1) channels.

The second operation, Fan In, does the opposite: it takes a bunch of
binary inputs and produces one channel containing the index of the "on"
channel. If more than one input channel is "on", the first "on" input
channel is selected.


@parameters

== Fan ==

    Operation:
        Selects either "Fan In" or "Fan Out".
    Channel Names:
        The names for the output channels that this CHOP creates. This
        also controls how many output channels are created (one for each
        name) in Fan Out mode. In Fan In mode, only one channel is
        created, and its name is the base name (minus the number suffix)
        of the first input channel.
    Outside Range:
        Determines how to handle input values that are outside the index
        range (0 to N-1).

        Clamp Index:
            If less than 0, clamp to 0, and if greater than N-1, clamp
            to N-1.
        Loop Index:
            Loop back through the index list.
        Set Channels to 0:
            Don't select any channels; set every channel to zero.
    All Channels Off:
        For a Fan In operation, when all input channels are off, set the
        output to -1 or 0.

        Set to 0:
            Selects the first channel.
        Set to -1:
            Doesn't select any of the channels.
