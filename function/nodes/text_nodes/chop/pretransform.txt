= Pretransform =

"""Takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and transforms them
using the pretransform of the given object."""

This CHOP takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and transforms
them using the pretransform of the given object. It is primarily used
remove the pretransform of a destination object from the output of
Object/Transform CHOPs before exporting to the destination object. A
combination of Object, PreTransform, and Export CHOPs can be used to
perform orientation constraints in objects.

If no input is given, then channels are simply generated from the given
object's pretransform. If an input is given, the interpretation of the
channels as a transform are defined by the __Input Transform Order__, and
__Translate/Rotate/Scale/Pivot Scope__ parameters. Any missing transform channels
from an input are filled in using the default value of `1` for the scales,
and `0` for all others. The input transform is then right-multiplied by
the (usually inverse) pretransform.

To affect only one set of channels coming into the CHOP, use the Scope
parameter.


@parameters

    == PreTransform ==

        Object:
            The name of the object to take the pretransform from
        Invert PreTransform:
            Invert the pretransform (This option should be on to remove
            the pretransform from the input channels.)
        Input Transform Order:
            The transform order of the input channels
        Translate/Rotate/Scale/Pivot Scope:
            The names of the input transform channels
        Out Transform Order:
            The transform order used to generate the output channels
        Out Pivot:
            The pivot used to generate the output channels

    == Channel ==

        Channel Names:
            The output channel names. This can be used to include the
            object name in the generated channels. If Input Channels is chosen,
	    then the channels will use the same names as its input. If there
	    is no input, then Input Channels behaves the same as Channel Name.
        Channel Range:
            Indicates how much of the channel to cook.

            Use Full Animation Range:
                All of the animated range.
            Use Current Frame:
                Only the sample at the current frame.
            Use Start/End:
                Specify the range below.
        Start:
            #channels: /start

            The start time of the desired interval of the object path.
        End:
            #channels: /end

            The end time of the desired interval of the object path.
        Extend Left:
            The left extend conditions.
        Extend Right:
            The right extend conditions.
        Default Value:
            #channels: /defval

            The default value for extend conditions.
