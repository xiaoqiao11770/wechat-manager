= VOP CHOP =

"""Contains a VOP network that can manipulate channel data."""

This node contains a [VOP network|/nodes/vop] (double-click the node
in the network editor to go inside it) which can use
[CHOP context |/vex/contexts/chop] VOPs to manipulate channel data. (To define
a CHOP using a (textual) VEX program instead of a VOP network, use the
[VEX CHOP|Node:chop/vex] instead.)

NOTE:
    If there are no channels, the network will not run.

This node is useful for creating "one-off" programs to manipulate channel data
in a single network.
