= Drop Shadow =

"""Creates a blurred shadow offset of an image."""

Drop Shadow creates a blurred, offset, shadow using the alpha channel of the input image.

The input's color is replaced entirely with the shadow color, then the alpha is expanded, blurred, and offset.  The result is put under the original image to create a composited layer that contains the shadow.

@parameters
Shadow Color:
	The color to draw the shadow in.
	
Expansion:
	Amount to expand the shadow, default in pixels.  A bit of expansion can ensure a strong shadow that would otherwise be washed out by blurring, especially with thin text.
	
Blur:
	Amount to blur the shadow.  Defaults to pixels.
	
Opacity:
	The alpha of the thickest part of the shadow.
	
Offset:
	The amount to offset the shadow to give the effect of directional lighting.
	
Units:
	The distance based parameters may either be specified in pixels or in uv coordinates.  This switches between the two specifications.
