= Contrast =

"""Increases or decreases the contrast of an image."""

This operation increases or decreases the contrast of an image. This can
be accomplished in two ways:

* *Range* - By setting the new values of the original black and white.
  The range will be remapped to fit the new values.

* *Scale* - By picking a center pivot (normally 0.5) and scaling about
  that value.

    == Contrast page: ==

        Range / Scale:
            Two different methods to apply contrast.

            The two methods attempt to be consistent with one another,
            however, the Range method can represent a wider variety of
            color transformations once the range moves outside 0 to 1.
            In this case, switching back to Scale may change the
            results.

            Each method provides a global setting and a component
            setting. The global contrast is applied first, and then the
            component contrast. The contrast is still done in one pass.


            Range:
                Contrast is increased by narrowing the range, and
                decreased by widening it. This method maps black and
                white to the new range values.
            Scale:
                Contrast is determined by a contrast factor and center.
                Increasing the contrast parm increases overall contrast
                by scaling the range about the contrast center, normally
                50% gray.
