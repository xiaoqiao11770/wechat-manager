"""Renders a mantra output driver directly into a composite network."""

This node activates a [mantra render driver node|Node:out/ifd] and
uses the render as the node's output image/sequence, allowing you render
directly into a compositing network to manipulate the rendered image.

This node currently only works with output drivers that produce `.pic`
format files. It does not support the OpenGL output driver
and output drivers that do not produce images.
It does not support Composite output drivers.
Use a [Fetch node|Node:cop2/fetch] to get images from other composite networks.

NOTE:
  Render COPs can only be processed serially. Only one may be actively cooking
  at a time.

@parameters

Driver:
    Selects the output driver to render.
Automatically Render when Necessary:
    Re-renders the image when any of the scene parameters change. If
    off, the last render is held.
Redo Render:
    Force a render update.
Determine Resolution from Driver:
    Use the resolution and pixel aspect ratio found in the output
    driver.
Determine Planes from Driver:
    Use the plane(s) and data formats specified by the output
    driver. For example, if a jpg is output, an 8bit color plane is
    used. If a tif16 is output, a 16bit color plane with alpha is
    used. All variables on Mantra's Deep Raster page are also
    rendered.
