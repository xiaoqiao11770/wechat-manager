= Pixel =

"""Modifies an image's pixels using expressions."""

This operation allows you to specify an expression to modify the pixels
of image. The expression is applied to each pixel in turn, and can be
specified separately for each color component (R, G, B, and Alpha).

There are a second set of expression parameters, which refer to the
first to fourth component of any plane, even if it is not Color or
Alpha.

This node is the 2D equivalent of the Point SOP. VEX scripts are much
faster than using this operator.


@parameters
    Use Color & Alpha Expressions, Then Generic:
        If on, the color and alpha expressions are used for Color (C.r,
        C.g, C.b) and Alpha. Any other plane types use the generic
        expressions. If off,the Generic expressions are used for all
        planes.
    Red, Green, Blue, Alpha:
        Expressions used exclusively by Color (C.r, C.g, C.b) and
        Alpha. All other planes use the generic expressions.
    Component 1-4:
        The generic expressions for all planes.

@locals
    R, G, B, A:
        The values of C.r, C.g, C.b (Color) and A (Alpha) of the first
        input.
    C1, C2, C3, C4:
        The values of components 1-4 of any of the scoped plane in the
        first input (which correspond to the output plane cooking). For
        example, if the currently cooking output plane is a Point plane,
        C1 will be P.x, C2 will be P.y, and C3 will be P.z of the first
        input's Point plane. C4 will be black.
    RS, GS, RS, RS:
        The values of color and alpha in the second input.
    CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4:
        The values of components 1-4 of the any of the scoped planes in
        the second input (which correspond to the output plane
        cooking).
    RT, GT, BT, AT:
        The values of color and alpha in the third input.
    CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4:
        The values of of components 1-4 of the scoped plane in the
        third input (which correspond to the output plane cooking).
    U, V:
        The UV coordinates of the current pixel (0 to 1).
    X, Y:
        The pixel location of the current pixel (0 to res-1)
    CH:
        The component (channel) of the current expression (0 to 3)
