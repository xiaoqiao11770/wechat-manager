= Field Merge =

"""Merges two fields into one Interlaced Frame."""

Merges two fields into one Interlaced Frame.The resulting sequence is
half as long as the input sequence.


@parameters
    Detect Field Type from Input:
        If on, the type of the sequence will be read from the sequence
        information of the input. Field Split and the generator
        Interlace parameters set this information. It is not
        automatically detected from loaded files.
    Others:
        The next two parameters are for manually specifying the field
        type.
    Field Dominance:
        The field dominance of the input sequence.

        Odd Dominant (Field 1):
            The odd scanlines (1,3,5...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
        Even Dominant (Field 2):
            The even scanlines (2,4,6...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
