"""Renders anti-aliased text."""

The Font COP renders anti-aliased text. If an input is attached, this
COP will add a new plane to the sequence or modify an existing plane.

Type 1, TrueType and OpenType fonts can be used. Houdini automatically scans 
the system and user font directories for compatible fonts.

The Font COP is Unicode compatible, and can display any glyph from a Unicode
font.

@parameters

== Font ==

Font:
    The font to use for drawing the text.
     
    By default the menu lists all known system fonts. You can  browse for a
    specific font file, if it is not listed.

    If on, the text is read from an ASCII file instead of the
    'Text' parameter.
Text:
    The text to render.
Text File:
    The name of the text file(s).

    When reading from a text file, this specifies the first line
    to start rendering.
Limit Num Lines:
    If on, this limits the number of lines rendered.
Text Size:

Tracking:
    Increases or decreases the horizontal and vertical spacing
    between characters and lines.

        Scale of the text.
