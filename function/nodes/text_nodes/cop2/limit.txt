= Limit =

"""Limits the pixel range at the high end, low end or both."""

This operation limits the pixel range at the high end, low end or both.
The limit can be enforced by either clamping the values to the limit
value, or by replacing the value with black.

Limit is useful for clamping floating point formats to the normal
black/white range, and for extracting highlights or shadows in an
image.

@parameters

    == Limit ==

        Lower Limit:
            #channels: /lval

            If on, the pixel values are clamped to this value if they
            are less than it.
        Upper Limit:
            #channels: /uval

            If on, the pixel values are clamped to this value if they
            are greater than it.
        Clamped Values:
            Either replaces the clamped values with the upper or lower
            limit value, or with black.
