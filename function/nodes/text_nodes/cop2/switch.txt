= Switch =

"""Passes the input of one of its connected inputs through, acting like
an exclusive switch."""

This COP passes the input of one of its connected inputs through, acting
like an exclusive switch. It does not use any image cache space, nor
does it cook anything.

NOTE: 
    If the __Input Index__ parameter is animated, the input sequences must 
    be identical in the following aspects: resolution, planes, data format, 
    and frame range. If you require that they differ, please use a [Blend COP|Node:cop2/blend] 
    instead with an integer blend factor. If the Input Index is not animated, 
    the input sequences do not need to match.


@parameters
    Input Index:
        The index of the input to pass through.
@locals
    [Include:coplocalvars]
