= Levels =

"""Adjusts black point, white point, and midrange to increase, balance,
or decrease contrast."""

You can adjust levels globally (affecting all channels) with the
__Value__ tab, or per-channel adjustments with the __R__, __G__, __B__,
or __Comp 4__ tabs.

This operator applies component adjustments before global adjustments.

Input Levels are used to compress the black and white point range,
increasing contrast. Gamma is applied as a midrange adjustment on the
range specified using Input Levels. Output Levels stretch the black and
white point range, decreasing contrast.

@parameters

== Levels ==


=== Value ===

    Adjust tonal range across all channels.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /frommax /frommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /gamma

        Adjust midrange balance. Note that the histogram
        viewport gamma slider maps from 10.0 --> 0.1
        logarithmically, thus behaving as a midrange adjustment,
        whereas the parameter dialog sliders map gamma
        logarithmically from 0.1 --> 10.0.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /tomax /tomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.


=== R ===

    Adjust tonal range for Red channel.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /redfrommax /redfrommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /red

        Adjust midrange balance.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /redtomax /redtomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.


=== G ===

    Adjust tonal range for Green channel.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /greenfrommax /greenfrommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /green

        Adjust midrange balance.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /greentomax /greentomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.


=== B ===

    Adjust tonal range for Blue channel.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /bluefrommax /bluefrommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /blue

        Adjust midrange balance.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /bluetomax /bluetomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.


=== A ===

    Adjust tonal range for Alpha channel.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /alphafrommax /alphafrommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /alpha

        Adjust midrange balance.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /alphatomax /alphatomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.


=== Comp 4 ===

    Adjust tonal range for Component 4 channel.

    Input Levels:
        #channels: /comp4frommax /comp4frommin

        Adjust black and white points to increase contrast.

    Gamma:
        #channels: /comp4

        Adjust midrange balance.

    Output Levels:
        #channels: /comp4tomax /comp4tomin

        Remaps the result of Input Levels and Gamma to reduce
        contrast.
