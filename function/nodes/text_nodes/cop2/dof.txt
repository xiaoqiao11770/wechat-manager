"""Creates a depth-of-field mask, which describes how out of focus parts
of the image are."""

This operation creates a depth-of-field mask, which describes how out of
focus parts of the image are. Combined with a Blur or Defocus COP, with
the mask set to M and "Per-Pixel Blur/Defocus" on, a depth-of-field
effect can be done. This mask can also used as an input to color
correction operations to accentuate an area of interest.

A point or depth plane (P or Pz) must be present in order for this
operation to produce valid results.

@parameters
    Focus Distance:
        The distance where everything is entirely in focus.
    Depth Adjustment:
        Increase or decrease the size of the area that will be out of
        focus. Corresponds to the "depth of focus" on a real camera
        lens.
    Distance Adjustment:
        Adds a constant value to the distance (which is not the same as
        adjusting the focus distance, which adjusts the dropoff as
        well).
    Default Mask Value:
        The mask value to use when a depth-of-field value cannot be
        computed (if the depth is zero).
