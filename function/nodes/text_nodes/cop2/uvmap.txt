    == UV Map ==

        U Reverse:
            If on, the U values are reversed (1 to 0).
        U Clamp:
            #channels: /clampu

            How U values below 0 or above 1 are dealt with.

            Off:
                No clamping occurs; U values may be less than 0 or
                greater than 1.
            Clamp:
                U values are clamped at 0 and 1.
            Repeat:
                U values are mapped back into the 0 to 1 range,
                producing a repeating ramp of U values.
            Mirror:
                U values are mapped back into the 0 to 1 range, but
                flipped every other time.
        U Cycles:
            #channels: /cyclesu

            Values higher than 1 produce more U cycles across the
            image.
        U Shift:
            #channels: /shiftu

            Shifts the start of the U cycle horizontally.
        V Reverse:
            If on, the V values are reversed (1 to 0).
        V Clamp:
            #channels: /clampv

            How V values below 0 or above 1 are dealt with.

            Off:
                No clamping occurs; V values may be less than 0 or
                greater than 1.
            Clamp:
                V values are clamped at 0 and 1.
            Repeat:
                V values are mapped back into the 0 to 1 range,
                producing a repeating ramp of V values.
            Mirror:
                V values are mapped back into the 0 to 1 range, but
                flipped every other time.
        V Cycles:
            #channels: /cyclesv

            Values higher than 1 produce more V cycles across the
            image.
        V Shift:
            #channels: /shiftv

            Shifts the start of the V cycle vertically.
