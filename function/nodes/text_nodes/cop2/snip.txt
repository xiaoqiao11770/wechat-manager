"""Either removes frames from a sequence or allows you to order them in
a user-defined order."""

This operation either removes frames from a sequence or allows you to
order them in a user-defined order. This operation does not use any
cache memory.


@parameters
    Frame Operation:
        "Snip Scoped Frames" removes the specified frames; "Keep Scoped
        Frames" keeps only the specified frames; "User Defined Order"
        re-orders the frames in the order defined in the "Frame Order"
        parameter.
    Frames:
        The frames to either Snip or Keep.
    Frame Order:
        The new order of the frames in the sequence.
    Automatically Adjust for Length Changes:
        If on, all the frame numbers will be adjusted when the length of
        the input sequence changes.
