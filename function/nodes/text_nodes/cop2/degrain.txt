"""Removes film grain from an image."""

Degraining is sometimes necessary to remove photographic grain from
images. Degrain targets high frequency variations in the image, which
are most often a result of film grain.

This process can also remove desired fine detail, so masks can also be
used to specify where degraining is to be done.

To degrain, start at the lowest degrain level and work up until the
grain is suppressed. Then reduce the Effect Amount parameter to balance
grain removal and detail.

    == Degrain ==

        Degrain Level:
            #channels: /level

            Controls the amount of grain to remove. Larger values
            suppress more grain, but this can also begin to remove
            desired details. Use the Effect Amount parameter to help
            blend the original image back in if this occurs.
