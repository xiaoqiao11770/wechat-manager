= Deinterlace =

"""De-interlaces a frame of video by either averaging scanlines or
copying a scanline."""

De-interlaces a frame of video by either averaging scanlines or copying
a scanline. You can choose which scanlines get kept, odd or even.

You can also choose to drop the scanline, which will then be replaced
with a color of your choice.


TIP:
    Averaging almost always looks best.
