Composite nodes create, filter, and manipulate image data. You can use compositing networks to edit textures, post-process rendered frames, or perform any other image manipulation in Houdini and make the image data available to other nodes.

== Compositing node flags == (flags)

[Image:/images/nodes/comp_nodetile_anno.png]

Display flag:
    Controls whether the node's image sequence appears in the
    viewer. You can set the display flag on multiple nodes by
    Shift-clicking the flag.

Render flag:
    Controls which node's output is the output for a compositing
    [subnetwork|/network/organize]  or  [digital asset|/assets] . Only one
    node in a network can have the render flag set.

Template flag:
    Specifies that the displayed image sequence should be compared
    to the output of this node.

Thumbnail flag:
    Instead of the standard node icon the node tile displays a
    thumbnail version of the node's output. Press ((RMB)) on the
    flag to choose which plane to use for the preview.

    If you choose "Follow" in the preview menu, the thumbnail uses
    the preview plane of its first input. This lets you change the
    change the preview plane of long chains of nodes by changing the
    preview plane of the first node in the chain. If the node has no
    inputs, "Follow" uses the first plane.

Bypass flag:
    The node passes the input through to the output unmodified (the
    node has no effect).
