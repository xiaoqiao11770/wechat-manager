"""Does a wipe between two input sequences."""

This operation does a wipe between two input sequences. A wipe is a
gradual transition from one image to another. The length of the
sequence is that of the first sequence.

    == Wipe ==

        Operation:
            The wipe to perform.

            Cross Dissolve:
                Blends each pixel from the first to the second input.
            Per Pixel Flip:
                Randomly switches each pixel from the first input to the
                second input.
            Vertical Wipe:
                Cuts the images horizontally and fits them together, so
                that one image is on top of the other.
            Horizontal Wipe:
                Cuts the images vertically and fits them together, so
                that one image is to the left of the other.
            4 Corner Shrink:
                Cut out a rectangular region in the middle of the second
                input for the first input.
            Circular Shrink:
                Bring out the second input from a circle (or ellipse) in
                the center of the first input.
            AA Circular Shrink:
                Same as above, but the edges of the circle are
                antialiased.
        Amount:
            #channels: /level

            The wipe position. Zero is fully input 1, one is fully input
            2.
        Draw Line:
            If on, a line is drawn at the wipe border (for Vertical,
            Horizontal, 4 Corner and Circular wipes).
        Line Width:
            #channels: /lwidth

            The width of the line drawn (fraction of the height/width).
        Line Color:
            #channels: /lcolr /lcolg /lcolb /lcola

            The color of the line drawn.
