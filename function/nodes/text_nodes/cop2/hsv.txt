= HSV =

"""Converts between RGB and HSV color spaces, or applies hue and saturation modifications."""

This operation converts between RGB and HSV color spaces, and also
performs a variety of HSV operations (hue shifts, saturation reduction,
etc).

Converting to HSV space allows you to use any operator to manipulate
HSV, and then convert it back into RGB space.

Using the HSV Adjust feature does simple global hue shifts, saturation
and value adjustments.

For more specific HSV changes, use the [Hue Curve COP|Node:cop2/huecurve].

@parameters

    == HSV ==

        Operation:
            The operation to perform, either HSV Adjust, Convert RGB to
            HSV or Convert HSV to RGB.
        Hue Shift:
            #channels: /hueshift

            Shifts the Hue by degrees around the HSV cone. This will change
	    all of the colors to different hues. Grey pixels are not affected.
        Maintain Luminance During Hue Shift:
            Maintains the perceptual luminance of the pixel when hues
            shift since some hues appear brighter than others.
        Saturation Scale and Shift:
            #channels: /satscale /satshift

            Adjusts the color saturation of the pixels. Normal saturation
            values lie between 0 (grey) and 1 (full color saturation). 
	    Shifting is normally used only to reduce the saturation, 
	    otherwise greyscale elements will suddently take on a random 
	    color. Scaling is the usual way to increase (>1) or decrease 
	    (<1) the color saturation of the image.
        Value Scale/Shift:
            #channels: /valscale /valshift

            Adjusts the value, or brightness, of the pixel. Normal color 
	    values lie between 0 (black) and 1 (white). Scaling is
	    equivalent to adjusting the brightness, while shifting adds
	    the same value to all pixels.
