= Window =

"""Cuts a small window out of a larger image."""

This operation reduces the resolution of the image, and allows you to
focus in on a specific area of the image. It does not replace the area
outside the windowed area with black; the original image information is
kept.

This operation effectively does a Transform and Crop.

NOTE:
    If Large Canvas support is off, this node does exactly the same
    thing as the Crop operation.


@parameters
    Method:
        The window area can either be represented by 2 opposite points
        of a rectangle, or the rectangles lower left corner and its
        width and height.
    Units:
        Specifies the units to crop in, either pixels or UV.
    Horizontal Area:
        The left/right bounds of the window area. This parameter cannot
        be animated; use the Offset parameter to pan the image through
        the window.
    Vertical Area:
        The bottom/top bounds of the window area. This parameter cannot
        be animated; use the Offset parameter to pan the image through
        the window.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offset1 /offset2

        An animatable image offset, so the image may be panned through
        the area.
        
    Hold Edges Outside Image Bounds:
        #channels: hold

        This determines the behavior of the crop when the crop window goes outside the normal image bounds. If on, the edge pixels will be streaked outward to fill the outside area. If off, black pixels will be used.
