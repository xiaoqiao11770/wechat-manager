= Transform =

"""Translates, rotates and/or scales the input image without changing
the image resolution."""

The transform is anti-aliased, and done in Translate, Scale, Rotate
order (TSR).

A moving transform can be blurred using the motion blur parameters.


TIP:
    When using expressions with motion blur, use $FF instead of $F for
    better results.

@parameters

    == Transform ==

        Units:
            Selects pixels or UV units for the transforms.
        Translate:
            #channels: /tx /ty

            The UV translation, in pixels or UV units.
        Rotate:
            #channels: /rz

            The rotation to apply to the image.
        Scale:
            #channels: /sx /sy

            The scale to apply to the image.
        Pivot:
            #channels: /px /py

            The pivot offset from the newly translated image origin,
            around which the image is rotated and scaled.
        X/Y Filters:
            The filter(s) to use when transforming.
        Filter Size:
            #channels: /size1 /size2

            The size of the filter (normally 1). Larger values produce
            a more blurred transform, while smaller values do less
            anti-aliasing.
        Image Wrap:
            How to wrap the image when outside its bounds (repeat,
            clamp, decal, mirror)
        Motion Blur:
            #channels: /mblur

            Toggles on motion blur, and specifies the time range around
            the current frame to blur.
        Motion Frame Bias:
            #channels: /mbias

            Shifts the time range for the blur.
        Motion Blur Segments:
            #channels: /mseg

            Number of samples to blur together in the specified time
            range.
        Motion Blur Method:

            Velocity:
                Only uses the current frame and the transform to compute
                past and future positions.
            Deformation:
                Cooks the images at all time samples.
