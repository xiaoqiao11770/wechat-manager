= Shift =

"""Shifts an image sequence in time."""

This operation shifts an image sequence in time. An optional second
input can be used as a reference, so that this sequence becomes 'linked'
to the start or end of the reference sequence and shifts if they
change.

This operation does not use any cache memory.

NOTE:
    This operator's parameters can not be animated (as they affect time).


@parameters
    Shift Method:
        Sequences can be shifted in several ways if no reference input
        is connected.

        Relative Shift:
            Shifts the amount specified by the Shift Value.
        Shift Start to Shift Value:
            Starts at the point specified by Shift Value.
        Shift End to Shift Value:
            Shifts the image sequence such that it ends at the point
            specified by the Shift Value.
    Input Shift:
        If a reference input is connected, several different ways of
        linking the two sequences together can be used. The sequence
        will always follow any changes in the reference sequence's start
        or end time.

        Align Start with 2nd Input's Start:
            Make the output sequence start at the same time as the sequence attached to input #2.
            
        Align End with 2nd Input's End:
            Make the output sequence end at the same time as the sequence attached to input #2.
            
        Shift To Precede 2nd Input:
            Output sequence will end on the frame just before the second input starts.
            
        Shift To Follow 2nd Input:
            Output sequence will start on the frame after 2nd input ends.
        
    Shift Value:
        The amount to shift by, in either frames or seconds.
    Units:
        The shift units, either Frames or Seconds.
