"""Renders geometry from a SOP as a single color image."""

This COP renders geometry from a SOP as a single color image. The
geometry is converted to polygons for rendering. An orthographic
projection is used.

[Include:is_a_generator]

@parameters

== Geometry ==

SOP:
    The path of the SOP containing the geometry.
View Down Axis:
    The axis the implicit orthographic camera is looking down.
Fit Geometry to Image:
    If on, the geometry is automatically scaled to entirely fit
    within the image.
Preserve Aspect Ratio When Filtering:
    If on, the 1:1 X/Y aspect ratio will be maintained when the
    geometry is fitted to the image.
Convert Detail:
    The level of detail that is used in the conversion of the
    geometry to polygons before rendering.
Anti Alias:
    The antialias level, from 1x1 (none) to 8x8 (highest).
Fill Color:
    The color to apply to the rendered image.

== Transform ==

Overview:
    Parameters for a 3D transform to apply to the geometry
    before rendering.
