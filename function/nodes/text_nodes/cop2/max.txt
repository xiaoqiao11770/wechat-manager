= Max =

"""Outputs the maximum value of the foreground and background images for
each pixel, which tends to lighten the image."""

The Max operation is also sometimes referred to as 'Lighten'. The
brighter pixel of the two images is always taken. The Max operation is
defined as:

`C = (if C1>C2) then C1; else C2`


TIP:
    The Layer COP allows multiple inputs to be composited instead of
    just two, each with its own compositing operation. The Composite COP
    is the more general version of this COP, allowing you to choose any
    compositing operation, and a optionally different operation for
    alpha.

@parameters

    == Composite ==

        Image Units:
            Selects pixels or UV units for the transform.
        Translate, Rotate, Scale, Pivot:
            Transforms the foreground in X,Y relative to the
            background.
        Image Filter:
            Specifies the filter to use when transforming.
        Image Wrap:
            Specifies the foreground image's wrapping style.
        Motion Blur:
            Toggles on motion blur, and specifies the time range around
            the current frame to blur.
        Motion Frame Bias:
            Shifts the time range for the blur.
        Motion Blur Segments:
            Number of samples to blur together in the specified time
            range.
        Motion Blur Method:

            Velocity:
                Only uses the current frame and the transform to compute
                past and future positions.
            Deformation:
                Cooks the images at all time samples.

    == Merge ==

        Overview:
            These parameters specify how to build the output sequence
            when there are differences between the input sequences.
        Plane Merge:
            If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
            output planes should be.
        Raster Depth:
            If the raster depth for a given plane differs between
            inputs, this specifies what the output raster depth for the
            plane should be.
        Frame Range:
            If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output range should be.
        Frame Rate:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output frame rate should be.
        Frame Match:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            which input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside
            on a frame boundary.
