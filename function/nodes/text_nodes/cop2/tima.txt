"""Uses a second input to time warp the first input on a per pixel
basis."""

This operation uses a second input image to time warp the first input
sequence on a per pixel basis. The second input image's luminance is
used to determine which frame to access in the first input. The 'Black
Pixel Frame' and 'White Pixel Frame' are used to specify the frame range
that the luminance values map to.


TIP:
    Try a Ramp or Noise COP as the second input.

@parameters

    == Time Machine ==

        Black Pixel Frame:
            #channels: /blackframes

            The frame value that a black pixel represents.
        White Pixel Frame:
            #channels: /whiteframes

            The frame value that a white pixel represents.

            Pixels between the black and white will have frame values
            that are linearly interpolated between the Black Pixel Frame
            and the White Pixel Frame. Values above white or below black
            will be extrapolated.

        Relative to Current Frame:
            If on, the frame value is added to the current frame,
            making the frame value an offset from the current frame. If
            off, the frame values represent actual frame numbers.
        Blend Frames:
            If on, fractional frames are computed and pixels from the
            two nearest frames are linearly blended together to produce
            the output frame's pixel.
        Before Start:
            If a filtered frame is before the beginning of the sequence,
            this determines what frame to use.


            Black:
                A black frame.
            Cycle:
                Cycle back into the sequence from the end (so 2 frames
                before the start will use frame 'end-2').
            Mirror:
                Mirror back into the sequence (so 2 frames before will
                use frame 'start+2').
            Hold:
                Use the first frame.
        After End:
            Similar to 'Before Start', except this parameter determines
            what frame to use if filtering goes past the last frame of
            the sequence.
