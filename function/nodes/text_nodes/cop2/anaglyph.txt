"""Creates an anaglyph from a pair of input images."""

This operation can be used to convert the rendered image pairs to anaglyphs.

@parameters

Horizontal Image Translation:
    The distance by which one image is horizontally translated with respect to the other image. The greater the HIT, the greater the apparent stereographic shift in the perceived depth of image elements. 
    
    Increasing the HIT will move the whole perceived 3D volume out of the screen, while decreasing it to negative values will push the 3D volume behind the screen.
