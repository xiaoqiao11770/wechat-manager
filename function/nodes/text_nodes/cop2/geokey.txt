"""Keys out parts of the image based on pixel position or normal
direction."""

This operation keys out parts of the image based on point position,
normal direction or both. A point plane and/or a normal plane are needed
to perform this operation.

Geokey can simulate lighting from point lights and infinite sources by
generating masks that can be used by color correction COPs, like the
Bright COP. It can also cut out foreground or background objects, if
point or depth information is present.

@parameters

    == Geokey ==

        Key Operation:

            Distance from Point:
                All pixels within a certain distance of a specified
                point are keyed (Point plane required).
            Normal Direction:
                All pixels with normals pointing in the same direction
                as the specified normal are keyed (Normal plane
                required).
            Angle from Point:
                All pixels with normals pointing at the specified point
                are keyed (Point and normal planes required).
            Distance & Angle:
                All pixels with normals pointing at the From Point
                specified point, within a certain distance are keyed
                (Point and Normal planes required).
            Clip Plane:
                All pixels on one side of the clip plane are keyed
                (Point plane required).
        Point Origin:
            #channels: /pos1 /pos2 /pos3

            A 3D point to key from, for 'Distance from Point', 'Angle
            From Point', and 'Distance & Angle'.
        Point Distance:
            #channels: /distance

            The distance from the point at which to stop keying.
        Distance Dropoff:
            #channels: /dropoff

            The size of the dropoff region after the distance radius.
        Normal Direction:
            #channels: /drx /dry /drz

            The normal direction to key from.
        Normal Deviation:
            #channels: /angle

            The amount of degrees that a normal can deviate from the
            specified normal before being rejected.
        Normal Dropoff:
            #channels: /dropangle

            The amount of degrees of dropoff after the normal
            deviation.
        Rolloff:
            The dropoff shape for the Normal Dropoff area.
        Clipping Plane:
            The orientation of the clip plane.
        Clip Plane Normal:
            #channels: /clipdirx /clipdiry /clipdirz

            The normal of the user-defined clip plane.
        Clip Plane Origin:
            #channels: /clippos1 /clippos2 /clippos3

            Translates the clip plane so that it passes through this
            point.
        Supersample:
            The number of subpixels sampled per pixel in one direction
            (2 samples 4 pixels, 3 samples 9). More subsamples produce
            finer edges, at the cost of performance.
        Discard Keyed Region:
            If on, the keyed region is discarded; otherwise only the
            keyed region is kept.
