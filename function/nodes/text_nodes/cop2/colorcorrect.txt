= Color Correct =

"""Applies a variety of color corrections to the image"""

This operation applies a variety of color corrections to the image, and
these can be independently controlled for the shadow, mid-tone and
highlight regions of the image.

The Shadow, Midtone and Highlight adjustments are applied first, and
then the Master controls are applied.

The individual adjustments are:

# Gamma

# Multiply (brightness)

# Add

# Contrast

They are applied in that order.

@parameters
    Master:
        #channels: /add /mult /gamma /contrast

        This set of controls is applied on the entire range of color.


        Add:
            The color to add or subtract the image.
        Mult:

        Gamma:
            Adjusts the gamma of the image.
        Contrast:
            Adjusts the contrast of the image; 1 is normal contrast.
    Shadow:
        #channels: /sadd /smult /sgamma /scontrast

        This set of controls have the same functions as above, but only
        apply to the low (shadow) areas of the image.
    Mid-tone:
        #channels: /madd /mmult /mgamma /mcontrast

        This set of controls adjusts the mid-tone areas.
    Highlight:
        #channels: /hadd /hmult /hgamma /hcontrast

        This set of controls adjusts the highlights.
