= Color Curve =

"""Adjusts the R,G,B and/or A channels based on a user-defined
curve."""

Adjusts the R,G,B and/or A channels based on a user-defined curve. This
node is normally edited interactively by clicking the 'Edit Color
Curves' button. This opens a popup curve editor.

The curve is generally in the range 0-1 (black-white), but it can be
drawn outside the range as well (for HDR images, depth maps, and such).

To edit the curve, first click 'Edit Color Curve' to pop open the curve
editor.

If you switch to a specific component (1,2,3,4) and then edit the curve,
the operator will automatically switch to component mode. It is often
easier to edit component curves alone by isolating the component.


@parameters

    == Color Curve ==

        Edit Color Curve:
            Opens a curve editor for interactive editing.
        Curve Extend:
            Before the first point and after the last, this defines the
            curve's behavior.

            Hold Last Value:
                The first or last value is held, clamping the color
                range at those values.
            Continue Along Last Slope:
                The values continue to increase or decrease outside the
                curve, based on the slope of the curve at the
                endpoints.
        Global/Components:
            You can edit components individually, or globally with one
            curve. The first time the mode is switched from global to
            components, the global curve will be copied into all the
            component curves.

            Global:
                All components are controlled by a single curve.
            Components:
                Each component has its own curve.
        Curves (Global, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha):
            The number of points in each curve.

            Point 1,2..:
                The U and V values of the point. The third value
                represents the points sharpness. A sharpness of 1
                produces a hard, linear edge at the point, whereas 0
                produces a smooth curve at the point.
