= Bump =

"""Builds a bump map from a plane."""

Builds a bump map from an image. The bump map can either be created as a
new plane, or it can replace the plane it was built from.

A bump map is built by detecting luminance edges in the image. These
edges become the bumps. The effect can be scaled up to mimic the effect
of a rough surface, or reduced to add only a slight amount of lighting
variation.

== Usage ==

    Bump maps can be used by the Lighting COP to produce semi-realistic
    lighting on ordinary images.


@parameters

    == Bump ==

        Bump:
            The bumps are computed by variations in luminance; this
            determines how to compute that luminance.
        Scale:
            #channels: scale

            Scales the bumps after generation.
        Simple Bump Map:
            If on, only 5 pixels are used to determine the bump map,
            otherwise all 8 neighbors plus the current pixel is used.
        Generate Bump Map:
            If on, instead of converting planes to bump maps, a source
            plane is used and the output bump map is added to the plane
            list.
        Source Plane:
            The plane to use as the bump source.
        Bump Name:
            The name of the new bump plane, if a new plane is being
            generated.
