= Convert =

"""Changes the data format of a plane."""

Changes the data format of a plane (i.e. how many bits per pixel you
get). The format can be 8bit integer, 16bit integer, 32 bit integer, 16
bit float or 32 bit float. All the integer formats may have their black
and white points set to values other that the default minimum and
maximum value.

If a second reference input is specified, the conversion parameters are
ignored. Instead, the planes that match the reference node's planes are
converted to the reference plane's data format. The scope may be used to
further refine which planes are converted. If a plane is not found in
the reference input's plane list, it will not be converted.


@parameters
    Raster Depth:
        Specifies the raster depth (8, 16, 32 bit integer or 16/32 bit
        float), and whether to use black and white points (for integer
        formats).
    Black / White Points:
        The black and white points for integer formats.
    Scope:
        Which planes to convert (the default is all, or in the case of a
        reference input, all planes that are found in the reference
        input).
