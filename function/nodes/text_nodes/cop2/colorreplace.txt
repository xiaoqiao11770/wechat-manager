= Color Replace =

"""Replace a color region in an image with another region."""

This COP is used to replace a color region in an image with another
region. The color region is defined by the hue, saturation, and
luminance ranges specified. Each of these ranges can be extended with a
soft rolloff function. The new region is simply specified by a target
color to which the center of the source region should map. The rest of
the region is mapped to its corresponding position around the target
color.

@parameters

    == Color Replace ==

        Source Hue/Saturation:
            #channels: /srchuesat

            The hue and saturation ranges of the source region to be
            mapped. The color wheel shows the key selection.
        Source Luminance:
            #channels: /srclum

            The luminance range of the source region to be mapped.
        Target Color:
            #channels: /targetclr

            The color to which the center of the source region will
            map.
        Hue Rolloff:
            #channels: /hrolloff

            Specifies the sharpness of the hue cutoff. This extends the
            hue range on either side by the rolloff size.
        Saturation Rolloff:
            #channels: /srolloff

            Specifies the sharpness of the saturation cutoff.
        Luminance Rolloff:
            #channels: /vrolloff

            Specifies the sharpness of the luminance cutoff.
        Rolloff Function:
            #channels: /rollfunc

            Specifies the rolloff function of the rolloff regions.
        Operation:
            #channels: /operation

            Specifies exactly how the color replace is performed.
        Supersample:
            #channels: /supersample

            The number of subpixels sampled per pixel in one direction
            (2 samples 4 pixels, 3 samples 9). More subsamples produce
            finer edges, at the cost of performance.
