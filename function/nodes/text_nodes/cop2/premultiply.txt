"""Allows colour to be converted to or from a premultiplied form."""

This operation allows color to be converted to or from a premultiplied
form. Premultiplied color is color than has already been multiplied by
alpha.

If multi-channel alpha is given (opacity), the appropriate components are
multiplied (Cr x Ar, Cg x Ag, Cb x Ab).
