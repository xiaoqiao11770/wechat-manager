= Velocity Blur =

"""Blurs an image by using pixel velocity to produce a motion blur
effect."""

This operation blurs an image by using pixel velocity to produce a
motion blur effect. The velocity is read from the velocity plane.
Velocity planes can be output by surface shaders which export the
geometry's velocity attribute.

NOTE:
    Velocity Blur can't quite do true motion blur.

@parameters

    == Velocity Blur ==

        Quality:
            #channels: /bquality

            Affects the smoothness of the blur. Higher qualities take
            more samples per pixel to blur (which is also slower to
            compute).
        Velocity Scale:
            #channels: /vscale

            Uniformly scales velocity to change the amount of blur.
        Per Pixel Velocity:
            If on, the velocity plane is used to determine the blur on a
            per-pixel basis. If off, a global velocity vector is used.
        Velocity Plane:
            The name of the velocity plane.
        Accurate Velocity Lookups:
            If on, the velocity is "followed" by sampling the velocity
            at each point, resulting potentially curved blur streaks. If
            off, only the initial velocity is used and the blur streaks
            are straight.
        Velocity Vector:
            #channels: /velocity1 /velocity2 /velocity3

            If Per Pixel Velocity if off, this is the global velocity
            vector that is used to produce a streaking blur.
        Start Blur Scale:
            #channels: /startscale

            The start blur factor. The first blurred pixel is
            multiplied by this value.
        End Blur Scale:
            #channels: /endscale

            The end blur factor. The last blurred pixel is multiplied by
            this value.
        Blur Dropoff:
            The interpolation function for pixel samples in between the
            start and end pixels.
        Filtering:
            The pixel sampling filter.


            None:
                Quick, low quality filter.
            Bilinear:
                Medium quality filter.
            Full Filtered:
                Slow, high quality filter.
        Correct for Image Aspect:
            If on, the blur is adjusted so it appears circular if the
            image aspect ratio isn't square.
        Outside Bounds:
            Specifies the sampling method for pixels outside the image.
