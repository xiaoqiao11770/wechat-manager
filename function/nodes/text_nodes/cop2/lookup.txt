= Lookup =

"""Applies a lookup table to the input."""

This operation applies a lookup table to the input, from either a LookUp
Table (LUT) file, a CHOP channel, or a second Input Map.

The second input defines the lookup table when the LUT source is Input
Row or Input Column. One row or column is taken as the lookup table. The
lookup map is evaluated at U or V position specified by the input pixel
value (0-1). Any input values below 0 or above 1 are clamped to 0 or 1.
The first plane is always used as the lookup table, and if it has
multiple components, they are applied to the appropriate components in
the output. The map is not interpolated, so small maps can be used to
quantize the image.

@parameters

    == Lookup ==

        LUT Source:
            The lookup table applied can be sourced from a CHOP channel,
            a LUT file or a row or column of the second input.
        LUT File:
            The LUT file to load and apply.
        CHOP:
            The CHOP path to fetch the LUT from.
        Row/Col Position:
            #channels: /rowcol

            The U or V coordinate of the row or column in the input
            image which represents the lookup table.
