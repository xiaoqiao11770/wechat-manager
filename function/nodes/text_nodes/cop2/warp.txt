= Time Warp =

"""Warps time by slowing or speeding it up throughout the sequence."""

This operation warps time by slowing or speeding it up throughout the
sequence. This operation does not use any cache memory as long as 'Frame
Round' is not set to 'Blend Frames'.


TIP:
    Try an index expression of $I + sin($I*5).


@parameters
    Warp Method:
        Allows you to control the warping using either an expression or
        a CHOP channel.
    Index:
        #channels: /index

        The expression to control the amount of warping. Try: $I +
        sin($I*5)
    CHOP:
        If you've set the Warp Method to CHOP, you should specify the
        CHOP path here.
    Frame Round:
        Rounds to the: Nearest, Previous, or Next Frame. If you select
        Blend Frame, it will perform the necessary temporal aliasing to
        provide a smooth result.
