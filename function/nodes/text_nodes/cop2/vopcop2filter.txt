= VOP COP2 Filter =

"""Contains a VOP network that filters input image data."""

This node contains a [VOP network|/nodes/vop] which can use COP context VOPs
to filter input image data. To define a COP using a (textual) VEX program instead of a VOP network, use the [VEX COP|Node:cop2/vexfilter] instead.

If you want to generate image data rather than filter it, use the 
[VOP COP2 Generator |/nodes/cop2/vopcop2gen] node instead.

This node is useful for creating one-off programs to filter images in a 
composite network. To use a VOP network to define a reusable composite node 
type, use a COP2 Filter VOP network.

  Compiler:
     The command that will invoke the VEX compiler.

  Force Recompile:
     Causes a recompile of the contained VOP network, regardless of 
     whether it is needed or not.
