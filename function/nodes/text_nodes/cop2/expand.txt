= Expand =

"""Expands and shrinks mattes."""

This operation expands and shrinks mattes, as well as providing a
non-destructive way of removing unwanted holes and specks from the
matte.

When masking this operation, the mask is used to determine the per-pixel
expansion.

NOTE:
    This can be a very slow operation for expansions larger than 10
    pixels.

@parameters

    == Expand ==

        Operation:
            The matte operation to perform.

            Expand:
                Expands the matte outwards while preserving edges.
            Shrink:
                Shrinks the matte inwards while preserving edges.
            Fill Holes:
                Fills holes in the matte smaller than a specified size.
            Remove Specks:
                Removes specks smaller than a specified size.
        Size:
            #channels: /size

            The number of pixels to expand or shrink. For filling holes
            and removing specks, this is the rough diameter of the hole
            or speck.
        Use Y Size:
            #channels: /ysize

            Allows you to specify a vertical expand size. The Size
            parameter represents the horizontal expand size when this is
            toggled on.
        Dropoff:
            #channels: /dropoff

            When expanding or shrinking, this adds a fuzzy edge to the
            resulting matte if non-zero. The fuzzy edge size is given in
            pixels.
        Use Y Dropoff:
            #channels: /ydropoff

            Allows you to specify a vertical dropoff. The Dropoff
            parameter represents the horizontal dropoff when this is
            toggled on.
        Dropoff Function:
            #channels: /droptype

            The dropoff function for the fuzzy matte edge.
        Hole Threshold:
            #channels: /holethresh

            An area is considered a "hole" if the matte intensity drops
            below this value.
        Speck Threshold:
            #channels: /speckthresh

            An area is considered a "speck" if the matte intensity goes
            above this value.
        High Quality:
            For expanding and shrinking, this uses a more accurate but
            slower algorithm. It removes artifacts in large expansions
            (>10).
        Use Luminance:
            When on, color is expanded by its luminance, rather than on
            a per-component basis. This is about 3x faster and looks
            roughly the same. The menu selects how the luminance is
            computed from the color (or other vector plane).
