= Field Swap =

"""Swaps the two fields containing the even and odd scanlines of the
frame."""

This operation swaps the two fields containing the even and odd
scanlines of the frame. If the sequence is interlaced or has already
been interlaced with a Field Split operation, then it will just swap the
frames representing even and odd scanlines. If the sequence is not
interlaced, then the even and odd scanlines are swapped within a frame.
