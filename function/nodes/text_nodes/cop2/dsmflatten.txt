"""Flattens a Deep Shadow/Camera Map into a flat 2D raster."""

Deep Shadow/Camera Maps store color information for all z-depths.
However, the compositor can only deal with 2D flat images.  This is a
simple COP which uses the VEX [Vex:dsmpixel] function to flatten a DSM/DCM
into a 2D image.

This COP is not strictly necessary since it's also possible to read
DSM/DCM images directly using the File COP.
