= Corner Pin =

"""Fits an image into an arbitrary quadrilateral."""

This operation allow you to fit an image into an arbitrary
quadrilateral, which allows you to do simple perspective tricks,
shearing and fitting.

Four points are used to pin the image and represent the different
corners of the input image.

Corner Pin is primarily an interactive operator. Handles can be moved
individually, or selected and moved as a group. To select a pin handle,
((Alt))+((LMB)) the handle, or ((Alt))+((LMB)) drag the box selector
around the handles.

In the viewport:

steps>>
    # ((RMB)) click or press ((E)) (default hotkey) to edit the handles
      on the input image. The viewed image will change to that of the
      input.

    # Adjust the handles by ((LMB)) dragging them to the corners of the
      area you wish to unpin.

    # You can ((Alt))+((LMB)) click a handle to select it, or
      ((Alt))+((LMB)) drag around handle to select them and move the
      selected handles as a group.((Alt))+((LMB)) click empty space to
      deselect the handles.

    # ((RMB)) click again or press 'e' to return to viewing the output
      of this node.
