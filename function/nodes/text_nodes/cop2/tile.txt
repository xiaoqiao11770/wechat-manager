= Tile =

"""Tiles the image sequence with multiple copies of the input image."""

This operation tiles the image sequence with multiple copies of the
input image. The copies can be flipped every other tiling by mirroring
the image.

The resolution of the image is increased by the amount of tiling
vertically and horizontally:

{{{
New X resolution = (old X resolution) * (# of tiles in X)
New Y resolution = (old Y resolution) * (# of tiles in Y)
}}}
NOTE:
    The amount of tiling in X and Y cannot be animated, as this changes
    the size of the image (though the offsets can be animated). If you
    want to animate the tiling, use a Transform COP with the Image Wrap
    set to 'Repeat' or 'Mirror' and animate the transform.


@parameters
    Tiling:
        #channels: /tiling1 /tiling2

        Specify the number of copies of the input image to tile here,
        both horizontally and vertically.
    Tile Offset:
        #channels: /offset1 /offset2

        Allows you to set the origin of the tiling (uses UV 0-1
        ranges). This will translate the tiles.
    Tile Method:
        Allows you to mirror the copies that you are tiling
        independently for X and Y.

        Normal:
            Don't do any mirroring.
        Mirror:
            Flip every other tile, starting with the second tile.
        Mirror First:
            Flip every other tile, starting at the first tile.
