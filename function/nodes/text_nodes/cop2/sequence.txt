= Sequence =

"""Sequences two or more inputs end to end."""

This operation sequences two or more inputs end to end. This operation
does not use any cache memory if all the input resolutions match;
otherwise for inputs that do not match the output resolution must be
scaled or cropped.


@parameters
    Plane Merge:
        If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
        output planes should be.
    Raster Depth:
        If the raster depth for a given plane differs between inputs,
        this specifies what the output raster depth for the plane should
        be.
    Resolution Match:
        If the image resolutions do not match, this parameter specifies
        what the output resolution should be.
    Size:
        If 'Resolution Match' is set to 'Specify Resolution', this
        parameter specifies the image size.
    Scale to New Size:
        If an input's resolution differs from the output, it will be
        cropped or extended with black unless this option is selected.
    Scale Filter:
        The filter to use when scaling.
    Frame Rate:
        If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines what
        the output frame rate should be.
