= Subnetwork =

"""Contains networks of other COPs."""

This COP contains networks of other COPs. To edit the COPNet contained
in this COP, press 'Enter' when the COP is current. When down, press 'u'
to jump out of the subnetwork.

Selecting Edit SubNetwork... from the op's pop-up menu presents you
with a new Network Editor with four subnetwork inputs. These four
inputs are connected directly to the four inputs on the Subnet op in
your original network. Proceed by attaching ops as required to these
four subnetwork inputs. The display op will be wired back to the output
connector of the Subnet op in your original op network. To get back to
the original op network, go up a level (type ((U))).

The output of the subnet COP is the output of the contained COP with its
render flag on. The image data is fetched from that COP; it is not
copied again.
