= Radial Blur =

"""Does a radial or angular blur."""

This operation does a radial or angular blur on the input image.

A Radial blur appears to blur away or towards a central point. An
angular blur blurs around a central point. Both operations can be done
simultaneously to produce a corkscrew-like effect.

@parameters
    Quality:
        #channels: /bquality

        Affects the smoothness of the blur. Higher qualities take more
        samples per pixel to blur.
    Radial Blur:
        #channels: /radialblur

        The amount of radial blur to apply. 1 = half the diagonal
        length of the image, 0 = none.
    Angular Blur:
        #channels: /angularblur

        The amount of angular blur to apply, in degrees.
    Angular Bias:
        #channels: /bias

        The bias of the rotation. '0' blurs the image from the current
        orientation N degrees. '1' blurs the image from the current
        orientation minus N degrees to the current orientation. '0.5'
        centers the blur around the current orientation.
    Center:
        #channels: /center1 /center2 / /center3

        The center point of the blur.
    Start Blur Scale:
        #channels: /startscale

        The start blur factor. The first blurred pixel is multiplied by
        this value.
    End Blur Scale:
        #channels: /endscale

        The end blur factor. The last blurred pixel is multiplied by
        this value.
    Blur Dropoff:
        The interpolation function for pixel samples in between the
        start and end pixels.
    Filtering:
        The pixel sampling filter.

        None:
            Quick, low quality filter.
        Bilinear:
            Medium quality filter.
        Full Filtered:
            Slow, high quality filter.
    Correct for Image Aspect:
        If on, the blur is adjusted so it appears circular if the image
        aspect ratio isn't square.
    Outside Bounds:
        Specifies the sampling method for pixels outside the image.
