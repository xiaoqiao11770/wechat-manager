"""Blends frames from two sequences together using a simple linear
blend."""

This operations blends frames from two sequences together using a simple
linear blend. An optional third sequence can be used to specify the
blend factor on a per-pixel basis.


@parameters

    == Blend ==

        Blend Method:
            When a third input is not attached, a global blend is
            applied between the 2 inputs.

            Use Blend Factor:
                Out = (1-Blend) * Input1 + Blend * Input2
            Use Blend Weights:
                Out = Weight1 * Input1 + Weight2 * Input2
        Blend Factor:
            Globally blends between input one (0) and two (1).
        Input 1 Weight:
            If using blend weights, this specifies the factor to
            multiply input 1 by.
        Input 2 Weight:
            This specifies the factor to multiply input 2 by.
        Normalize Weights:
            If on, the weights will always be scaled to sum up to 1.
        Blend Mask:
            If a third input is used to control the blending, this menu
            selects the plane or component to use as the blend mask.
            Black is input 1, white is input 2.
        Invert Blend Mask:
            If on, black is input 2, while white is input 1.

    == Merge ==

        Overview:
            These parameters specify how to build the output sequence
            when there are differences between the input sequences.
        Plane Merge:
            If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
            output planes should be.
        Raster Depth:
            If the raster depth for a given plane differs between
            inputs, this specifies what the output raster depth for the
            plane should be.
        Frame Range:
            If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output range should be.
        Frame Rate:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output frame rate should be.
        Frame Match:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            which input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside
            on a frame boundary.
