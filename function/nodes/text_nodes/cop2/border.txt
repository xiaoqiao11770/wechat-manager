= Border =

"""Adds a border to the image."""

Adds a border to the image, by either increasing the image resolution by
the border width and height (which does not overwrite any existing
pixels) or by placing the border on top of the pixels around the edges
of the image.

@parameters

    == Border ==

        Selects the units for the border parameters.


        Units:

            UV Coords:
            Pixels:
        Border Left/Right:
            #channels: /borderh1 /borderh2

            The width of the left and right borders applied to the
            image.
        Border Top/Bottom:
            #channels: /borderv1 /borderv2

            The height of the top and bottom borders applied to the
            image.
        Border Color:
            #channels: /colorr /colorg /colorb /colora

            The color used to fill the border area.
        Increase the Resolution by Borders:
            If on, the resolution is increased by the border widths and
            heights. If off, the border overwrites the pixels at the
            edges of the image.

            NOTE:
                If this parameter is on, the border widths and heights
                cannot be animated.
