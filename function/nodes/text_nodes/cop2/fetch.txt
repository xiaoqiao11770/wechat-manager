= Fetch =

"""Fetches a sequence of images from another COP, even in another network."""

This COP fetches a sequence of images from another COP located anywhere in the Houdini directory structure. None of the image data is actually stored at this node.

Using a Fetch acts exactly like connecting the output of this node to its input, effectively connecting two nodes in different networks. It can also fetch a COP from the same network, which is sometimes useful if the network is huge and the Fetch and source COP are far apart.


@parameters
    COP:
        The path to the COP to fetch.
