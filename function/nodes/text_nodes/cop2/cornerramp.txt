= Corner Ramp =

"""Generates a four corner ramp."""

Generates a ramp by interpolating points. By default, the points are
setup to mimic a 4-corner ramp. However, any number of points can be
used.

Each point is assigned its own color and weight. The point weight
determines how much area the point affects. Increasing a point's weight
will make it affect a larger area.

This type of ramp complements the more structured ramps found in the
Ramp operator.

In the viewport, the ramp can be edited using:

table>>
    tr>>
        td>> Add a new ramp point.
        td>>
            ((LMB)) click at the desired point location.
    tr>>
        td>> Move a point.
        td>>
            Drag the point using ((LMB))
    tr>>
        td>> Change the color of a point.
        td>>
            ((LMB)) click the point to change. Use the color editor to
            select the color.
    tr>>
        td>> Select a point.
        td>>
            ((Alt + LMB))
    tr>>
        td>> Select multiple points.
        td>>
            Drag ((Alt + LMB)) around the points.
    tr>>
        td>> Increase or decrease a point's weight.
        td>>
            Drag on the point with ((MMB)).

@parameters

== CornerRamp ==

Point Distance:
    Determines how the distance from a point is calculated.


    Radial:
        Straight line distance; produces a radial
        interpolation.
    Block:
        Horizontal + Vertical distance; produces more linear
        interpolation
Correct for Aspect Ratio:
    When on, the aspect ratio of the image is compensated for,
    so that Radial Distance computations produce circular
    falloffs, regardless of the shape of the image.

=== Ramp Points ===

Even though this operator normally produces 4 corner ramps,
you can add as many (or as few) points as you like to
produce more detailed ramps. At least 2 ramp points are
recommended, otherwise the ramp will be constant.

These parameters occur once for each point.

Point `[num]`:
    The (u,v) location of this ramp point.
    
Color:
    The color of this ramp point.
    
Weight:
    The weight of a point determines how much it
    contributes to the ramp. The point weight is relative to
    all other points' weights (so if all the weights are 2,
    the ramp would appear the same as if they were all 1).
    Increasing a point's weight makes a larger area of
    effect in the ramp. Setting the weight to zero removes
    the point from the ramp altogether.
