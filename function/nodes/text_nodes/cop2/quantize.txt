= Quantize =

"""Quantizes input data into discrete steps."""

This operation quantizes input data into discrete steps, reducing the
levels of color in the image. Large steps produce a posterizing effect.

@parameters

    == Quantize ==

        Pixel Step:
            #channels: /step

            The intensity spacing between quantized levels. This is
            expressed in fractions of the black and white range (0 to
            1), so 0.1 produces 11 levels between black and white (0,
            0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 0.9 and 1).
        Pixel Offset:
            #channels: /offset

            Shifts the level where quantizing occurs. For an offset of
            0.05 with a step of 0.1, the levels would be 0.05, 0.15,
            0.25, ... 0.95.
