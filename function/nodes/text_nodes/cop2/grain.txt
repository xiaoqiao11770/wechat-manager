@parameters

    == Grain ==

        Grain Amplitude:
            #channels: /amp

            The intensity of the grain added.
        Grain size:
            #channels: /gsize

            The size of the grain particles.
        Grain Gamma:
            #channels: /gamma

            Applies a gamma to the varying intensity of the grain.
        Grain Bias:
            #channels: /bias

            The grain produced has both positive and negative values.
            The bias will shift the distribution so that more values are
            positive (1) or negative (-1).
        Grain Color:
            #channels: /gcolorr /gcolorg /gcolorb /gcolora

            The color of the grain.
        Noise Seed:
            #channels: /seed

            The random seed for the grain noise. Different seeds
            produce different grain patterns.
        Luminance Relative:
            If on, the intensity of the grain will be proportional to
            the luminance of the pixel the grain is being applied to.
        Grain Varies Over Time:
            If on, grain will change on a per-frame basis. Otherwise,
            it will remain unchanged throughout the sequence.
        Grain Varies Per Color Component:
            If on, the grain noise will be different on each component.
            Otherwise, each component will have the same grain noise
            value, multiplied by the grain color.
