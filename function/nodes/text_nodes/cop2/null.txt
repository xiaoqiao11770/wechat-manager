= Null =

"""Does nothing."""

This operation does nothing. It acts simply as a placeholder to make
wiring networks easier, or to allow you to reference a single output COP
without having to update all the references to it if the real output COP
changes.

This COP does not use any image cache space, nor does it cook anything.
