"""Performs a pulldown (cine-expand) on the input sequence."""

A pulldown converts non-interlaced film to interlaced video sequences.

@parameters
    Film Rate:
        The frame rate of the film sequence (normally 24fps)
        
    Video Rate:
        The frame rate of the output video (30fps for NTSC, 25fps for
        PAL)
        
    Field Offset:
        The frame offset where the pulldown pattern begins.
        
    Field Dominance:
        The field dominance of the video.

        Odd Dominant (Field 1):
            The odd scanlines (1,3,5...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
            
        Even Dominant (Field 2):
            The even scanlines (2,4,6...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
