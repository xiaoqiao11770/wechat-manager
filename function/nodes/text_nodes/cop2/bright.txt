"""Applies a brightness factor and bright shift to the first input."""

Applies a brightness factor and bright shift to the first input. The
pixels are multiplied first by the brightness factor, then the shift is
added.

    == Bright ==

        Brightness:
            The brightness factor. The pixels are multiplied by this
            factor first.
        Bright Shift:
            A shift to add to the pixels, after the brightness has been
            applied.
        Use Component Controls:
            Allows you to affect each channel of a plane differently.
            Incurs a small performance hit.
        Red, Green, Blue, Component 4 Bright/Shift:
            The per-component brightness and bright shift. The
            brightness is multiplied by the global brightness, and the
            shift is added to the global shift.
