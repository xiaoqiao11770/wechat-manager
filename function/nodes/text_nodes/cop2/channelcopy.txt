= Channel Copy =

"""Copy channels from any of inputs into the output image."""

This operation allows you to copy channels from the planes of any of the
inputs into the output image.

The various channel manipulations are:

* Copy an input plane to an output plane

* Copy an input plane to an output component, by computing the
  luminance.

* Copy an input component to an output plane, by replacing all its
  components with the input component.

* Set an output plane to black, white or a custom color.

Input planes can be taken from any input. An output component
should only be written to once; if a plane or component is written to
more than once, only the last operation will have an effect.

    == Channel Copy ==

        Copy Controls:
            #channels: numcopies

            Creates more instances of Target/Source pairs so that any
            number of channel manipulations can be done in a single
            ChannelCopy.
        Target:
            #channels: copyto<<n>>

            The output plane that will be written to.
        Source:
            #channels: copyfrom<<n>>

            The image data to be written into the target plane. If the
            target is a component, and the source is a color or vector,
            the second menu will determine how to convert the color into
            a component.
        Color:
            #channels: color<<n>>

            If the source is a constant color, this determines the
            color.
