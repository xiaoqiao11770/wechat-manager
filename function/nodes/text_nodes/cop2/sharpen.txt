= Sharpen =

"""Sharpens an image by enhancing the contrast of edges."""

This operation sharpens an image by enhancing the contrast of edges.
Increasing the size of the sharpen kernel reduces the pixel noise that a
sharpen operation enhances.


@parameters

    == Sharpen ==

        Size:
            #channels: /ssize1 /ssize2

            Increases the size of the areas over which it performs the
            sharpen (in pixels). Larger values will enhance larger
            features.
        Units:
            The units that the Size parameter is expressed in, either
            pixels or UV coords.
        Effect:
            #channels: /effect

            Intensity of the sharpen effect.
        Noise Suppress:
            #channels: /threshold

            If on, image noise is not sharpened. Noise is any edge that
            has a smaller magnitude than the Noise Suppress value. This
            produces clearer images.

            Image variances less than the suppress value are not
            sharpened (as if the effect was zero). If a blend region is
            used, variances just above the suppress cutoff are sharpened
            somewhat, depending on their position within the blend
            region.

        Suppress Function:
            Determines how noise in the Suppress Blend range is
            sharpened:

            Sharp Cutoff:
                No blend region is used.
            Linear:
                Sharpening is uniformly reduced.
            Ease In:
                Sharpening is gradually reduced.
            Ease Out:
                Sharpening is quickly reduced.
            Ease In Ease Out:
                Similar to linear but using a smoother function.
            Gaussian:
                Similar to Ease In Ease Out, with a quicker dropoff.
        Suppress Blend:
            #channels: /suppressblend

            The size of the blend region between full sharpening and no
            sharpening of the variances just above the noise threshold.
            This prevents "patches" of sharp areas in the image by
            blending the patches in.
        Show Edges:
            Sharpens all the edges, while removing non-edge components.
