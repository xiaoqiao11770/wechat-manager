= Time Filter =

"""Blurs a pixel through several frames."""

This operation applies a blur filter to a series of frames around the
current frame. It produces a time smoothing effect. Time Filter works
best on frames that aren't changing very quickly.

@parameters

    == Time Filter ==

        Filter Width:
            #channels: /frames

            The size of the filter, in frames.
        Blur Effect:
            #channels: /effect

            The amount of blur to apply (0 = none, 1 = full effect)
        Filter Type:
            The type of blur filter to apply - box, hanning (triangle)
            or Gaussian.

            Box:
                All frames are weighted equally, which produces an
                averaging effect.
            Hanning:
                Frames in the middle of the filter are weighted more
                than frames at the edge, by using a tent-like filter.
            Gaussian:
                Frames in the middle of the filter are weighted more
                than frames at the edge, by using a gaussian filter,
                which is smoother than the Hanning filter.
        Filter Range:
            What frames are filtered.

            Before Current:
                The frames from 'current' to 'current-filterwidth' are
                filtered.
            Centered About Current:
                The frames from 'current-filterwidth/2' to
                'current-filterwidth/2 + filterwidth'
            After Current:
                The frames from 'current' to 'current + filterwidth'
        Before Start:
            If a filtered frame is before the beginning of the sequence,
            this determines what frame to use.

            Black:
                A black frame.
            Cycle:
                Cycle back into the sequence from the end (so 2 frames
                before the start will use frame 'end-2').
            Mirror:
                Mirror back into the sequence (so 2 frames before will
                use frame 'start+2').
            Hold:
                Use the first frame.
        After End:
            Similar to 'Before Start', except this parameter determines
            what frame to use if filtering goes past the last frame of
            the sequence.
