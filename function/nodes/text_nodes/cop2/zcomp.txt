= Z Comp =

"""Does a Z composite of two images."""

This operation does a Z composite of two images. At least one image
should have a depth or point plane containing depth information. If an
input does not have any of these planes, its depth is considered to be
0.

@parameters

    == Z Composite ==

        Foreground Offset:
            #channels: /offset1 /offset2 /offset3

            Allows you to specify an offset Z-depth, as well as an XY
            offset for the foreground image (X,Y,Z)
        Use Depth Plane For Background:
            The background will use a depth or point plane if on. If
            off, specify the global depth of the image with the
            Background Depth parameter.
        Background Depth:
            #channels: /backdepth

            The global background depth.
        Use Depth Plane For Foreground:
            The foreground will use a depth or point plane if on. If
            off, specify the global depth of the image with the
            Foreground Depth parameter.
        Foreground Depth:
            #channels: /foredepth

            The global foreground depth.
        Supersample:
            #channels: /supersample

            The amount of aliasing to do. '2' means 2x2.
        Focal Length, Aperature:
            #channels: /focal /aperature

            If the foreground is translated in X or Y, the Focal Length
            and Aperature parameters are used to recompute the X and Y
            values from the new Z value..
