= Front Face =

"""Cleans up flipped normals by making them face the camera. """

Frontface is used to flip normals in a Normal map. Occasionally,
geometry will render out with normals that are flipped from what they
should be (pointed away from the camera on a surface that faces the
camera). This operator can fix these problem areas for operations that
differentiate backfacing normals from frontfacing ones (like Lighting or
Environment).

All this node does is negate the normal or leave it alone, based on
whether it matches the facing criteria. Normally, it flips backfacing
normals only. However, you can also make all the normals backfacing by
flipping front facing, or you can specify an arbitrary vector for the
frontface test.

steps>>
    # Change the viewer to view the Normal plane (N).

    # Select the alignment (Toward, Away from Camera, or Toward
      Direction). Normally, you'll want to make all normals frontfacing,
      so select 'Towards Camera'.

    # Adjust the 'Max Angle Difference' parameter until most of the
      edges are in the direction you want and you don't see any
      individual pixels with badly flipped normals. You may not be able
      to get the normal plane perfectly frontfacing, depending on the
      normals in the map..


@parameters

    == Front Face ==

        Align:
            #channels: /align

            The direction the normals should be facing.

            Toward Camera:
                Towards the camera or viewer, the most common
                orientation.
            Away From Camera:
                Away from the camera or viewer.
            Toward Direction:
                Towards an arbitrary direction, defined by a direction
                vector.
        Direction:
            #channels: /directionx /directiony /directionz

            Specifies the direction vector for 'Toward Direction'
            alignment.
        Max Angle Difference:
            #channels: /maxangle

            The normal flipping threshold. If the angle that the normal
            makes with the camera or direction vector is less than this
            amount, the normal will not be flipped. Otherwise, the
            normal is flipped.
        Override Normal Name:
            If on, you can specify a different plane for the normals.
            By default the normal plane is "N".
        Normal Name:
            #channels: /nname

            The name of the plane containing normals.
