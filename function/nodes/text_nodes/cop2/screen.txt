= Screen =

"""Adds two images together, saturating at white like photographic
addition."""

Screen adds two images together without producing values above white,
even if both images are white. Because of this, it is usually preferred
to the Add operation for additively compositing color. The Screen
operation is defined as:

`C = C1 + C2 - C1*C2`

Screen begins to produce odd results when the input data climbs above
white (greater than 1) or below black (less than 0).


TIP:
    The Layer COP allows multiple inputs to be composited instead of
    just two, each with its own compositing operation. The Composite COP
    is the more general version of this COP, allowing you to choose any
    compositing operation, and an optionally different operation for
    alpha.

@parameters

    == Composite ==

        Image Units:
            Selects pixels or UV units for the transform.
        Translate, Rotate, Scale, Pivot:
            Transforms the foreground in X,Y relative to the
            background.
        Image Filter:
            Specifies the filter to use when transforming.
        Image Wrap:
            Specifies the foreground image's wrapping style.
        Motion Blur:
            Toggles on motion blur, and specifies the time range around
            the current frame to blur.
        Motion Frame Bias:
            Shifts the time range for the blur.
        Motion Blur Segments:
            Number of samples to blur together in the specified time
            range.
        Motion Blur Method:

            Velocity:
                Only uses the current frame and the transform to compute
                past and future positions.
            Deformation:
                Cooks the images at all time samples.

    == Merge ==

        Overview:
            These parameters specify how to build the output sequence
            when there are differences between the input sequences.
        Plane Merge:
            If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
            output planes should be.
        Raster Depth:
            If the raster depth for a given plane differs between
            inputs, this specifies what the output raster depth for the
            plane should be.
        Frame Range:
            If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output range should be.
        Frame Rate:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output frame rate should be.
        Frame Match:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            which input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside
            on a frame boundary.
