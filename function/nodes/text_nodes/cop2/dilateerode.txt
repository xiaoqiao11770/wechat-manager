= Dilate/Erode =

"""Expands and shrinks mattes."""

This operation expands and shrinks mattes, in a more efficient, less
rounded way than the expand operation. It is good for making slight size
changes to a matte. For larger changes, the matte tends to start looking
squarish, and Expand is recommended in these cases.

@parameters

    == Dilate/Erode ==

        Size:
            The number of pixels to dilate or erode. Positive values are
            dilations, while negative are erosions.
        Y Size:
            The vertical size of the effect can be de-coupled from the
            horizontal.
        Units:
            Whether Size and Y-Size are in pixels or uv coordinates.
