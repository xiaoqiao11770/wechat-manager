"""Deforms an image by moving the underlying UV coordinates."""

This operation deforms an image by moving the underlying UV coordinates.
An input plane is used to define the deformation. This plane can define
the deformation in several ways:

*UV Map* :
    The plane contains the UV coordinates to map to. (Hint: Use a UV Map
    generator to create a base UV map to manipulate)
*UV Shift* :
    The plane contains per-pixel translations to apply to the image.
    Floating point deform plane or planes with negative values work best
    with this method.
*UV Gradient* :
    The plane is a 1 channel mask. Pixels are moved in the direction of
    the gradient (2D vector pointing in the direction of greatest value
    increase). (Hint: Try using a concentric ramp as a deform plane)
This operation can also be thought of as a per-pixel transform.

        UV Map:
            The plane contains the UV coordinates to map to. (Hint: Use
            a UV Map generator to create a base UV map to manipulate)
        UV Shift:
            The plane contains per-pixel translations to apply to the
            image. Floating point deform plane or planes with negative
            values work best with this method.
        UV Gradient:
            The plane is a 1 channel mask. Pixels are moved in the
            direction of the gradient (2D vector pointing in the
            direction of greatest value increase). (Hint: Try using a
            concentric ramp as a deform plane)
    Scale:
        The scale applied to the UV Shift or UV Gradient method
        transformations.
    Image Wrap:
        How UV coordinates above 1 or below 0 are wrapped back into the
        0 to 1 range, if at all.

        Repeat:
            The image is repeated, by mapping the UV value back into the
            0-1 range.
        Clamp:
            The UV value is clamped at 0 or 1, which holds the edge
            values.
        Black:
            UV Values outside 0-1 are replaced with black.
        Mirror:
            The image is repeated, by mapping the UV value back into the
            0-1 range. The image is flipped every other repetition.
