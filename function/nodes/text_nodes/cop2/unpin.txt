"""Extracts an arbitrary quadrilateral area out of the input image."""

This operation allows you to extract an arbitrary quadrilateral area out
of the input image and stretch it to fill the full resolution of the
output. It is the opposite of corner pin.

Four points are used to define the desired area of the input image.
Image data outside the desired area is discarded.
