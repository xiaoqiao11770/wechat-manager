= Sky Environment Map =

"""Creates sky and ground images for use as environment maps."""

This node generates a multi-plane image. The image has named planes `Left`,
`Top`, `Bottom`, `Front`, and `Back`. The `C` plane contains the "right"
plane.

You can use this image in shaders with `Environment map` or `Reflection map`
parameters. You can render the image to disk using a
[Composite output node|Node:out/comp], or refer to this node's output
directly using `op:`. For example, if you have a Sky environment map node
at `/img/skyenvmap1`, you can refer to its output in a shader parameter using
`op:/img/skyenvmap1`.

NOTE:
    Sky environment map is a [digital asset|/assets]. You can double-click
    it to go inside and find two lower-level asserts, skycube (for ramp-based
    images) and skycubedaylight (for simulated images). These assets may be
    interesting to technical users as examples of VEX-based compositing nodes.

@parameters

== Sun ==

Use:
    Controls which of the following parameters are available to set the position of the sun in the image.

Rotate:
    The Euler rotation angles to align -Z axis vector towards the sun.

Direction Vector:
    The explicit vector that points towards the sun.

Azimuth:
    Azimuth of the sun in the image. Note that the default plane (`C`) shows the
    _right_ view, so `90` will put the sun straight ahead in that view.

Elevation:
    Elevation of the sun in the image.

Latitude:
    Latitude of the observer, used to compute the position of the sun based on the
    date when __Use__ is not __Angle and elevation__.

Longitude:
    Longitude of the observer, used to compute the position of the sun based on the
    date when __Use__ is not __Angle and elevation__.

Date:
    Date of observation, used to compute the position of the sun when __Use__ is
    __Location, date, and time__.

Time:
    Time of observation, used to compute the position of the sun when __Use__ is
    __Location, date, and time__.

Day of Year:
    A (fractional) day of the year (for example, 0.5 would be noon on January 1),
    used to compute the position of the sun when __Use__ is __Location, date, and time__.

== Sky ==

Use:
    Controls whether the sun is rendered using a physically realistic simulation
    or using an artistically controllable color ramp.
    
    The __Realistic__ option is especially useful when animating the time of day,
    since it automatically produces realistic colors for sunrise, sunset, high
    noon, and so on. The __Ramp__ option gives you artistic control of the colors,
    but does not simulate atmospheric effects, for example along the horizon.

Haziness:
    Controls how sunlight scatters in the air, used when __Use__ is __Realistic__.

Brightness:
    Controls the brightness of the sky, used when __Use__ is __Realistic__.

Color ramp:
    Manually sets a color ramp from the sun to the surrounding sky, used when
    __Use__ is __Ramp__.


== Ground ==
Render Ground As;
    Sets the method by which the ground plane will be rendered.

    Albedo:
	The ground will be rendered using the albedo as the color.
    Infinite horizon:
	The horizon color is repeated as the ground plane color.
	
    Mirror:
	The sky above the horizon is mirrored below.
	
    None:
	No ground will be rendered. The color will be set to black
	with alpha zero.

Albedo:
    Sets the albedo of the ground.

Normal:
    Sets the orientation of the ground plane. Only used when __Use__ is 
    __Ramp__.

Horizon elevation:
    Sets the horizontal elevation of the viewer. Only used when __Use__ is 
    __Ramp__.
