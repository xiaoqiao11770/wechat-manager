= Shuffle =

"""Shuffle frames around to do out-of-order editing."""

This operation allows you to shuffle frames around to do out-of-order
editing. It does not use any cache memory.

This is intended to be an interactive operation, most easily manipulated
in the timeline. Drag a frame handle to its new position to move it, and
SHIFT-drag a handle to another frame to swap it with that frame.


@parameters
    Shuffle Frames:
        A string specifying how the frames are to be moved about. The
        format is as follows:

        A-B:
            Move frame A to frame B, moving all frames in between by 1.
        A:B:
            Swap frames A and B.
