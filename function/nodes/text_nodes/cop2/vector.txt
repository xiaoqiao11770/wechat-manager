= Vector =

"""Performs vector operations on the input."""

This operation performs vector operations on the input. The input planes
are considered to be arbitrary vectors (either 2, 3 or 4 elements).
Scalar planes (like alpha) are treated like 1 element vectors.

@parameters

== Vector ==

    Operation:
        Specifies the operation to perform.

        Normalize Vectors:
            Scales all components so the magnitude is exactly 1.
        Transform Points:
            Transforms the vectors as if they were points by the
            following Transform parameters.
        Orient Vectors:
            Rotates the vectors as if they were normals.
    
    Transform Order:
        Defines the transformation for transforming the vectors.
