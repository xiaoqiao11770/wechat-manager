"""Adds a lighting effect to the image by using a bump map."""

Emboss is a simple lighting effect which uses a bump map to produce
shadows and highlights. Both diffuse and specular colors can be used to
light the image.

The position of the light determines where the highlights and shadows
will occur, as well as the specular highlight. The X/Y position is in
the UV space of the image (0-1), while Z is used to determine the
distance of the light from the image (this only has an effect on the
reflectivity of the image, and not the intensity of the light).

The bump plane can either be generated from the image itself, or Emboss
can use a Bump plane connected to either input 1 or 2. The 'Bump Plane'
parameter should contain the name of this plane. In the event that both
input 1 and 2 contain a bump plane, the plane from input 2 takes
priority. A bump plane can be generated using the Bump COP.

For more advanced lighting effects, the Lighting COP can be used.

@parameters

== Emboss ==

    Light Position:
        #channels: /lightposx /lightposy /lightposz

        Positions the light relative to the image. (0.5, 0.5) is
        the center of the image (0 is the left or bottom, 1 is the
        right or top). The Z component determines how far the light
        is from the image, which affects how the light reflects off
        the bumps. The distance does not affect light intensity.
    Diffuse Color:
        #channels: /diffr /diffg /diffb /diffa

        The color of the light.
    Specular Color:
        #channels: /specr /specg /specb /speca

        Determines the color of all the specular highlights.
    Diffuse Dimmer:
        #channels: /diffdimmer

        Allows you to increase or decrease the diffuse
        contributions.
    Specular Dimmer:
        #channels: /specdimmer

        Allows you to increase or decrease the specular
        contributions.
    Bump Height:
        #channels: /bumpscale

        Higher bumps produce more noticeable shadows and highlights.
        This parameter affects both the auto-generated bump plane or
        the user-supplied bump plane.
    Specular Model:
        #channels: /specmodel


        Phong:
            A good specular model for metallic-looking specular
            effects.
        Blinn:
            A good specular model for non-metallic specular
            effects.
    Phong Exponent:
        #channels: /specexp

        The larger the exponent, the more defined the specular area
        becomes. Affects the Phong specular model only.
    Blinn Roughness:
        #channels: /specrough

        Roughness describes the smoothness of the surface; smooth
        surfaces scatter light much less than rough ones. Increasing
        the roughness will increase the extent of specular
        highlights. Affects the Blinn specular model only.
    Bump Plane:
        #channels: /bumpplane

        When supplying a bump plane to emboss through either the
        first input or the second input, you need to select the
        plane used as the bump plane.
