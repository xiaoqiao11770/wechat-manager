= Merge =

"""Merges the planes of several inputs together."""

This operation merges the planes of several inputs together. Most of the
parameters determine how to handle differences in the sequences, such as
image size, frame range and plane conflicts.


@parameters
    Plane Conflict:
        Planes from different inputs with the same name are in conflict.
        A conflicting plane is the second plane or later which matches
        an existing plane name. This parameter determines how to resolve
        the conflict.

        Rename Conflicting Plane:
            The plane is renamed by adding a unique suffix number.
        Add to Plane Array if Identical else Rename:
            A plane array is created if the planes' data format and
            structure match, otherwise the conflicting plane is
            renamed.
        Add to Plane Array if Identical else Ignore:
            A plane array is created if the planes' data format and
            structure match, otherwise the conflicting plane is not
            merged in.
        Ignore Conflicting Planes:
            Any conflicting planes are not merged in.
        Error if Conflicts Occur:
            A conflict flags a cooking error.
    Resolution Match:
        If the resolutions of the inputs are not all the same, this
        parameter determines how to choose the output resolution.
    Size:
        If Resolution Match is set to 'Specify a Resolution', this is
        the parameter which specifies the size.
    Scale to New Size:
        If on, all inputs not matching the output resolution are scaled
        to the output resolution, otherwise they are cropped or extended
        with black.
    Scale Filter:
        The filter to use when scaling images.
    Frame Range:
        If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines what
        the output range should be.
    Frame Rate:
        If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines what
        the output frame rate should be.
    Frame Match:
        If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines which
        input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside on a frame
        boundary.
    Input <<n>> Scope:
        One of these parameters is available for each connected input.
        Only planes listed in the scope will be merged from the given
        input; the others will be ignored ('*' indicates all planes).
        You can use the menu button to select planes from the available
        input planes.
