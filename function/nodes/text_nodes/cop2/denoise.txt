"""Removes white noise from an image."""

Denoise attempts to remove noise in an image by reducing curvature in
the image height field.

This process is slow. In many cases, the other noise suppression tools
(Median, Degrain, and Blur) will suffice at a fraction of the speed.

The result is the removal of high frequency specks. However, unlike a
blur, sharp edges can be maintained. Note that fine texture detail will
be treated as noise and suppressed.

An interesting painterly effect can be achieved by first adding white
noise to an image using the Noise COP and then applying a few dozen
iterations of Denoise.

        Iterations:
            Governs the number of rounds of denoising that will be
            performed on the image. Running time is proportional to the
            number of rounds. Additional iterations will increase the
            removal of noise at the expense of losing more fine detail.
        Diffuse:
            A scale factor for the amount of diffusion to apply in each
            round of iteration. The total amount of diffusion will thus
            be this times the Iterations. However, if this is made too
            large, the process can become unstable and not converge to a
            good result.
        Full Sequence:
            Instead of operating on a single frame, perform the denoise
            calculation across the entire sequence. This requires the
            entire sequence be loaded into memory and processed at once,
            so may be infeasible for large images or long sequences.
            This will result in greater frame-to-frame coherency of the
            resulting denoising.

            An internal cache is generated for each image plane (such
            as C or A) denoised. To save out the result in a file ROP
            it is recommended to only save one plane at a time so the
            cache can be used.

        Pixel Size:
            Acts as the conversion factor from pixel space into the
            three dimensional coordinates in which the denoising will
            occur. The relative magnitude of the pixel size is
            important, not the absolute values. This is primarily used
            for the Full Sequence mode to determine how far in Z one
            frame should be. Making the Z steps smaller or larger will
            affect the relative importance of temporal coherence versus
            spatial coherence.
