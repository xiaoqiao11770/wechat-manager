= Composite =

"""Does a composite (over, under, inside, add, etc) between two
images."""

This operation does a composite (over, under, inside, add, etc) between
two images. The first image is the foreground, which may be translated
relative to the second input, the background. The size of the resulting
image is the size of the background image. This cop supports
multi-channel alpha ( _A{r, g, b}_).


TIP:
    The Layer COP allows multiple inputs to be composited instead of
    just two.

@parameters

    == Composite ==

        Operation:
            Specifies the compositing operation:

            Over:
                Places the foreground over the background.
            Under:
                Places the foreground under the background's alpha.
            Atop:
                Places the foreground over the background only where the
                background alpha exists.
            Inside:
                Places the foreground inside the background's alpha.
            Outside:
                Places the foreground outside the background's alpha.
            Screen:
                Acts as a saturating add, much like photographic
                addition.
            Add:
                Adds the foreground to the background.
            Subtract:
                Subtracts the foreground from the background.
            Diff:
                Takes the absolute difference between the foreground and
                the background.
            Multiply:
                Multiplies the background by the foreground.
            Minimum:
                Takes the minimum of the foreground and background.
            Maximum:
                Takes the maximum of the foreground and background.
            Average:
                Takes the average of the foreground and background.
            Xor:
                Takes the exclusive or of the two alpha planes, so that
                alpha areas that overlap are removed.
        Image Units:
            Selects pixels or UV units for the transform.
        Translate, Rotate, Scale, Pivot:
            Transforms the foreground in X,Y relative to the
            background.
        Image Filter:
            Specifies the filter to use when transforming.
        Image Wrap:
            Specifies the foreground image's wrapping style.
        Motion Blur:
            Toggles on motion blur, and specifies the time range around
            the current frame to blur.
        Motion Frame Bias:
            Shifts the time range for the blur.
        Motion Blur Segments:
            Number of samples to blur together in the specified time
            range.
        Motion Blur Method:

            Velocity:
                Only uses the current frame and the transform to compute
                past and future positions.
            Deformation:
                Cooks the images at all time samples.

    == Merge ==

        Overview:
            These parameters specify how to build the output sequence
            when there are differences between the input sequences.
        Plane Merge:
            If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
            output planes should be.
        Raster Depth:
            If the raster depth for a given plane differs between
            inputs, this specifies what the output raster depth for the
            plane should be.
        Frame Range:
            If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output range should be.
        Frame Rate:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output frame rate should be.
        Frame Match:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            which input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside
            on a frame boundary.
