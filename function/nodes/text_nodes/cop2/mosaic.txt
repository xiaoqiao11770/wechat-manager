"""Takes a sequence of images and combines them into 1 image by tiling them."""

This operation takes a sequence of images and combines them into 1 image
by tiling them. If the sequence is not completely divisible by the
number of images per line or images per frame, the missing tiles are
filled with a background color.

A limit on the number of images per frame can also be used to create more than one mosaic frame with a smaller set of images.


@parameters
    Images per Line:
        #channels: /numperline

        Defines the number of image per row or per column, depending on
        whether images are stacked by row or column.
    Stack Vertically:
        Defines the vertical stack order.
    Stack Horizontally:
        Defines the horizontal stack order.
    Stack Images in Rows:
        If on, images are stacked horizontally first, then vertically.
        If off, images are stacked vertically first.
    Max Images/Frame:
        #channels: /imagelimit

        Limits the number of input images in one image. If on, each 'N'
        input images form 1 output image. If off, the entire sequence is
        put into 1 image.
    Keep Full Size:
        If on, the image will always have at least as many images as
        specified in 'Images per Line' and 'Max Images/Frame', even if
        the sequence is shorter than either value. The missing frames
        are filled with the background color.
    Background Color:
        #channels: /backcolorr /backcolorg /backcolorb /backcolora

        The color to substitute for areas of the mosaic not covered
        by input frames, which can occur if the number of frames in the
        input is not evenly divisible by the Images per Line (or Max
        Images per Frame).
