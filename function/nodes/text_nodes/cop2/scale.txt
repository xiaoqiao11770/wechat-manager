= Scale =

"""Changes the resolution of the image."""

This operation changes the resolution of the image. The contents of the
image are scaled appropriately. The aspect ratio may be optionally
preserved.

Scale does not affect the cook resolution of its Inputs.

NOTE:
    As Scale affects the resolution of the image sequence, its
    parameters cannot be animated (if animation is desired, use a
    Transform COP's scale parameter).


@parameters
    Scale:
        Specifies the scaling method:

        To Resolution:
            Scales to the specified number of pixels.
        To Fraction:
            Scales to a fraction (e.g. 0.5 = 50%)
        To Aspect Ratio:
            Scales to a given Pixel Aspect ratio.
        To Second Input's Resolution:
            Scales to match the resolution of the second input.
        To a Fraction of the Second Input:
            Scales to match the resolution of the second input scaled by
            a fraction (e.g. 0.5 = 50%).
        To Second Input's Aspect Ratio:
            Scales to match the second input's aspect ratio.
    Image Size:
        Specify the size the image should be scaled to (in Pixels).
    Image Fraction:
        Specify the size you'd like to scale the image as a fraction
        (e.g. 0.5 = 50%).
    Pixel Aspect:
        Pixel Aspect is the ratio of the width to the height. Specify
        the pixel aspect ratio to scale the image by here.
    Preserve Aspect Ratio:
        When enabled, it preserves the ratio of the image width to
        height when scaling.
    Image Filter:
        Specifies the type of filter to use when scaling. The Box filter
        is the fastest; for almost all uses, the Gaussian is the best
        choice; use Catmull when you need something a bit sharper than
        Gaussian.
