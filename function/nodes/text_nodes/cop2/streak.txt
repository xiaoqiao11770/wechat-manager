= Streak Blur =

"""Streaks an image, adding a motion blur effect."""

Streak blurs an image in a single direction, creating an effect similar
to motion blur. The direction and length of the streaks are constant.

@parameters

    == Streak Blur ==

        Size:
            #channels: /size

            The length of the streaks, in pixels.
        Rotation:
            #channels: /rot

            Specifies the streak direction (0 is horizontal, 90
            vertical).
        Streak Bias:
            #channels: /bias

            Determines how the streak is centered on the pixel creating
            the streak. To center the streak around the pixel, use 0. To
            make the streak end at the pixel, use -1 (the streak comes
            before the pixel that generates it). To make the streak
            begin at the pixel, use 1.
        Falloff:
            The intensity falloff of the streak from the pixel that
            generated it.

            None:
                No falloff; the streak has constant intensity.
            Linear:
                The intensity falls off linearly.
            Gaussian:
                The intensity drops off gradually.
        Falloff Amount:
            #channels: /falloffamount

            The amount of the streak that has a falloff. By default,
            this is the entire streak (1). This parameter can be
            adjusted so that only the ends of the streak fall off (ie.
            0.1-0.3).
