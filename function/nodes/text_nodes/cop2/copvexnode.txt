== Overloading VEX Parameters ==

This operator is implemented in VEX, which supports parameter
overloading. If the first input has a plane which matches an
operation parameter's channel name, the input plane will be used as
the parameter's value, effectively overriding it. The overloaded
parameter is then evaluated from the plane on a per-pixel basis.

_eg._ If the input COP has the following planes:

{{{
C{r,g,b}
A
fogdens
}}}
and it is fed into a VEX Fog COP, the fog density will be determined
at each pixel by the fogdens plane, since the Fog Density
parameter's channel name matches the 'fogdens' channel name.
