To edit the curve in the curve editor, you can:

* ((LMB)) click to add a new curve point.

* ((LMB)) drag a point to a new location

* Select points by ((Alt))+((LMB)) clicking them, or by ((Alt))+((LMB))
  dragging a box around them.

* Delete a point by pressing ((Del)) while over the point.

* Increase the curves sharpness at a point by ((MMB)) dragging the
  point.

* If you switch to a specific component (((1)), ((2)), ((3)), ((4))) and
  then edit the curve, the operator will automatically switch to
  component mode. It is often easier to edit component curves alone by
  isolating the component.


@parameters

    == Hue Curve ==

        Edit Hue Curve:
            Opens a curve editor for interactive editing.
        Hue Operation:
            Either adjusts saturation or luminance of hues.

            Adjust Saturation:
                Boosts or reduces the color saturation of hues.
            Adjust Luminance:
                Changes the luminance of hues.
        Hue Curve:
            #channels: /curve

            The number of points in the hue curve.

            Point 1,2..:
                The U and V values of the point. The third value
                represents the points sharpness. A sharpness of 1
                produces a hard, linear edge at the point, whereas 0
                produces a smooth curve at the point.
