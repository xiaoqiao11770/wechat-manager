= Crop =

"""Crops an image and changes its resolution."""

This operation crops an image, reducing the resolution of the images.
All information outside the cropped region is thrown away.


TIP:
    If you wish to retain the cropped data outside the frame (for
    possible downstream use), use a Window COP instead.


TIP:
    If you wish to crop an image without changing the resolution (by
    filling outer areas with black), use a Border COP.


@parameters
    Method:
        The region cropped can either be represented by 2 opposite
        points of a rectangle, or the rectangles lower left corner and
        its width and height.
    Units:
        Specifies the units to crop in, either pixels or UV.
    Horizontal Crop:
        #channels: hcrop

        The left/right crop values. This parameter is not animatable.
    Vertical Crop:
        #channels: vcrop

        The bottom/top crop values. This parameter is not animatable.
    Offset:
        #channels: offset

        An animatable image offset, so the image may be panned through
        the cropped area.
    Hold Edges Outside Image Bounds:
        #channels: hold

        This determines the behavior of the crop when the crop window
        goes outside the normal image bounds. If on, the edge pixels
        will be streaked outward to fill the outside area. If off, black
        pixels will be used.
