= Color Map =

"""Maps a range of color to a new range."""

Color Map can map a small range to the full black and white range, do
the inverse, or map an arbitrary range to another arbitrary range.

NOTE:
    Color Map is a little more flexible that Contrast, as it allows you
    to pick the color range to map, whereas contrast only allows you to
    pick the range to map black-white to. Functionally, they do exactly
    the same operation - Color Map just does a bit more math for you.

@parameters

    == Color Map ==

        Color can be mapped using global or component controls. Component controls give you the ability to map each component differently.

        == All ==

            From Range:
                #channels: /frommax /frommin

                The range of color to be mapped.
            To Range:
                #channels: /tomax /tomin

                The new range of color that the old range will occupy.

        == Components ==

            Red/Green/Blue/Alpha From:
                #channels: /redfrommax /redfrommin /greenfrommax /greenfrommin /bluefrommax /bluefrommin /alphafrommax /alphafrommin

                Individual component source ranges.
            Red/Green/Blue/Alpha To:
                #channels: /redtomax /redtomin /greentomax /greentomin /bluetomax /bluetomin /alphatomax /alphatomin

                Individual component destination ranges.
