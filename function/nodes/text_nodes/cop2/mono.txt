"""Converts a color or vector into a scalar quantity, like luminance or length."""

This operation converts a color or vector into a scalar quantity, like
luminance or length. Optionally, vector planes can be converted to
scalar planes.

        Operation:
            How to convert the color or vector to a scalar luminance.

            Luminance:
                A simple RGB luminance formula is used.
            NTSC Luminance:
                A different RGB luminance formula specifically for NTSC
                is used.
            Average:
                The average value of the components is used.
            Maximum Component:
                The maximum component value is used.
            Minimum Component:
                The minimum component value is used.
            Magnitude:
                The magnitude, or length, of the vector is used. Most
                useful for Point and Normal planes.
            Hue:
                The RGB color is converted to HSV, and the hue is used.
            Saturation:
                The RGB color is converted to HSV, and the saturation is used.
            Red:
                The red (first) component is used.
            Green:
                The green (second) component is used.
            Blue:
                The blue (third) component is used.
            Component 4:
                The forth component is used (this is not alpha).
        Keep Vector Planes as Vectors:
            If on, vector planes are not converted to scalar planes - the same luminance value is applied to all components.
