"""Equalizes colors by stretching or shifting the image histogram."""

This operation equalizes colors by stretching the image histogram.
Several modes are available, selectable via the Operation menu.

The color transform is either a shift or a scale, depending on the fit
method.

* *Stretch Range to Black/White* - The minimum and maximum values found
  in the image are mapped to black and white, which may result in a
  contrast adjustment and a luminance shift.

* *Move Minimum Value to Black* - The values are transformed so that the
  minimum value maps to black.

* *Move Maximum Value to White* - The values are transformed so that the
  maximum value maps to white.

* *Move Average Luminance* - The global luminance is computed and all
  values are transformed so that the global luminance matches the
  specified value.

* *Equalize Luminance Across Frames* - The global luminance is computed
  for several frames around the current frame. The current frame's
  global luminance is transformed to match the average global luminance,
  effectively removing frame flicker.

    == Equalize ==

        Operation:
            The equalization operation to perform:


            Stretch Range to Black/White:
                The minimum and maximum values found in the image are
                mapped to black and white, which may result in a
                contrast adjustment and a luminance shift.
            Move Minimum Value to Black:
                The values are transformed so that the minimum value
                maps to black.
            Move Maximum Value to White:
                The values are transformed so that the maximum value
                maps to white.
            Shift Average Luminance:
                The global luminance is computed and all values are
                transformed so that the global luminance matches the
                specified value.
            Equalize Luminance Across Frames:
                The global luminance is computed for several frames
                around the current frame. The current frame's global
                luminance is transformed to match the average global
                luminance, effectively removing frame flicker.
        Fit Method:
            The transformation, either a bright scale or shift.
        Luminance:
            The method for computing luminance.
        Black:
            #channels: /black

            What value 'black' is defined to be, normally zero. (black &
            white are independent of black/white points)
        White:
            #channels: /white

            What value 'white' is defined to be, normally one.
        Average Luminance:
            #channels: /average

            The luminance to move the average luminance to.
        Frames Before:
            #channels: /before

            Number of frames before the current frame to analyze (for
            Equalize Luminance only).
        Frames After:
            #channels: /after

            Number of frames after the current frame to analyze.
        Effect:
            #channels: /effect

            The amount of effect equalize has on the image (0 is none, 1
            is full effect).
