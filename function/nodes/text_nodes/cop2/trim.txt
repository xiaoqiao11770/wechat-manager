= Trim =

"""Trims an input sequence in time by adjusting the beginning or the end
of the sequence."""

This operation trims an input sequence in time by adjusting the
beginning or the end of the sequence. If the start time is moved beyond
the beginning of the sequence, the pre-extend option of the sequence is
used to determine the image (similarly with the end, using
post-extend).


TIP:
    This operation is best viewed in the Timeline.


@parameters
    Trim:
        Specify whether the trim should be:

        Relative to Current Start/End:
            Trim values represent start/end offsets.
        Absolute Start/End Values:
            Trim values are start/end frames.
        Single Image:
            Trim a single image out of the sequence by specifying the
            frame.
        Single Image Relative to Start:
            Trim a single image out of the sequence by an offset from
            the start.
        Single Image Relative to End:
            Trim a single image out of the sequence by an offset from
            the end.
    Units:
        Specify Frames or Seconds.
    Start:
        The start frame or offset to begin the trim at.
    End:
        The start frame or offset to end the trim at.
