= Field Split =

"""Splits an interlaced frame into two fields per frame (odd and even
fields)."""

This operation splits a frame into 2 fields containing the even and odd
scanlines of the frame. The resulting sequence will be twice as long as
the original.

Alternatively, only the even or odd scanlines can be extracted from the
frame, in which case the resulting sequence will be as long as the input
sequence.


@parameters
    Split:
        The split operation.

        Frame to 2 Fields:
            Splits each frame into 2 fields. The sequence will be twice
            as long.
        Odd Fields:
            Extracts the odd scanlines from each frame. The sequence
            length remains unaffected.
        Even Fields:
            Extracts the even scanlines from each frame. The sequence
            length remains unaffected.
    Field Dominance:
        The field dominance of the new sequence.

        Odd Dominant (Field 1):
            The odd scanlines (1,3,5...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
        Even Dominant (Field 2):
            The even scanlines (2,4,6...) appear in the first field of
            the video pair.
