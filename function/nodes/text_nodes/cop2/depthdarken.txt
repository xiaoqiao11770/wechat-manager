= Depth Darken =

"""Darkens depth boundaries in an image."""

Depth Darken creates dark halos on the deep side of depth
discontinuities.

The input should be a deep raster with the Pz channel present and
containing the depth information of the image.

Because the depth darkening is done on a per pixel basis, the cleanest
results can be gained by rendering a higher resolution image with no
sub-sampling and scaling the image after applying the depth darkening.
This ensures there is only one z-value per pixel which avoids artifacts
caused by antialiasing of edges.


@parameters
    Depth Scale:
        Differences in depth have to be converted into differences in
        intensity. As the size of scenes can vary, the correct ratio
        will vary depending on the size of the scene. The Depth Scale
        allows one to compensate for the ratio of the scene.
    Radius:
        The diameter of the depth darkening effect. Pixels up to this
        radius from the depth boundary can be affected.
    Maximum Darken:
        The final darkening effect is clamped against the maximum
        darken value. A solid black halo can be too aggressive, so
        smaller values are useful to modulate the extent of the effect.
    Use Logarithmic:
        Unlike traditional color values which have a fixed range,
        z-depth values can vary considerably over the image. Working
        with linear z-values may cause far away depth discontinuities to
        be exaggerated because their absolute difference is large,
        despite their relative difference being the same. By working in
        logarithmic space, a depth boundary that doubles the distance to
        the camera will have a fixed level of effect.
