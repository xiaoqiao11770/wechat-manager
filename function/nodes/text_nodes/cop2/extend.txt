= Extend =

"""Extends the length of a sequence so that it can be animated beyond
its frame range."""

This operation extends the length of a sequence so that it can be
animated beyond its frame range. This operation can also be used to
change the sequence's extend conditions.

NOTE:
    This operation does not use any cache memory.


@parameters
    Extend Before/After:
        The number of frames to extend before or after the sequence. The
        menu determine how the missing frames are filled in.

        Black Frames:
            Black frames are used for the extended frames.
        Cycle:
            Frames are cycled from the sequence so the extended sequence
            appears cyclic.
        Mirror:
            Frames are cycled in a mirrored fashion so the extended
            sequence cycles back and forth.
        Hold:
            The first/last frame is held for the extended frames.
    Pre/Post Extend:
        Changes the Pre or Post extend condition of the sequence.
    Pre/Post Hold:
        Changes the Pre or Post hold of the sequence when the new extend
        condition is 'Hold for N frames'.
