"""Adds a variety of atmospheric effects to an image, including fog,
haze and heat waves."""

This operator adds a variety of atmospheric effects to an image,
including fog, haze and heat waves. A plane containing the depth of the
fog is required, normally depth (Pz) or a point plane (P).

The different fog effects are:

* *Normal Fog* - As distance increases, the pixel color changes to the
  fog color.

* *Additive Fog* - The fog color is added to the pixel color. Looks more
  "cloudy".

* *Haze* - As distance increases, the pixel's saturation decreases, so
  distant pixels appear more gray.

* *Heat Waves* - Adds a shimmering heat wave effect to distant pixels.

@parameters

    == Fog ==

        Fog Type:
            The atmospheric effect to be applied.

            Normal Fog:
                As distance increases, the pixel color changes to the
                fog color.
            Additive Fog:
                The fog color is added to the pixel color. Looks more
                "cloudy".
            Haze:
                As distance increases, the pixel's saturation decreases,
                so distant pixels appear more gray.
            Heat Waves:
                Adds a shimmering heat wave effect to distant pixels.
        Fog Density:
            #channels: /fogdens

            The density of the atmospheric effect. For each depth unit,
            this amount is applied.
        Fog Color:
            #channels: /fogcolr /fogcolg /fogcolb /fogcola

            The color of the fog for fog effects (Normal and Additive
            fog only).
        Distance Offset:
            #channels: /distoff

            A constant value added to the per-pixel distance.
        Fog Direction:
            The direction the distance is computed in, either X,Y,Z or
            camera depth.
        Smooth Edges:
            Enabling this option attempts to blend the fog on edges with
            sharp changes in depth. Because only 1 depth value is stored
            per-pixel, and they aren't normally blended, some edges can
            have sections look fogged and some that aren't at all,
            depending on the sampling. This option detects edges and
            corrects these artifacts.
        Smooth Edge Threshold:
            Edges are blended if the edge transition is greater than
            this threshold, from the current edge pixel to a
            neighboring pixel. If all the neighboring pixels are
            within this distance of the current pixel, it is not
            considered an edge and smoothing is not applied.

    == Heat (only applicable for Heat Waves): ==

        Smoothness:
            #channels: /heatsmoothness

            The number of samples taken from the image. '1' produces a
            grainy effect, while higher values produce a blurry effect.
        Horizontal Scale:
            #channels: /heatx

            How much horizontal deviation the heat waves cause.
        Vertical Scale:
            #channels: /heaty

            How much vertical deviation the heat waves cause.
        Time Scale:
            #channels: /heatspeed

            How quickly the heat waves change.
        Noise Offset:
            #channels: /heatoff1 /heatoff2 /heatoff3

            The 3D noise offset for the heat waves. Animate the 'Y'
            parameter with $F to see rising heat waves.

    == Layer ==

        Layered fog restricts the fog to one side of a clipping plane,
        either in X,Y or Z. A falloff region can be applied to make the
        transistion less abrupt.

        Layered:
            Turns layered fog on, with the fog appearing in the
            specified area. The most common type of layered fog is 'Y
            Layered Below' (for ground hugging fog) and 'Y Layered
            Above' (for clouds).
        Layer Edge:
            #channels: /layer

            Where the fog begins to falloff to zero. If Layered is set
            to 'Y Layered Below', all values with a Y value lower than
            the layer edge value will be fogged.
        Layer Falloff:
            #channels: /lfall

            The size of the falloff region, which produces a gradual
            decrease in the fog once the Layer Edge has been reached.
        Falloff Function:
            The shape of the falloff region.

    == Noise ==

        Fog noise increases the believability of the fog, as it appears
        somewhat uneven and patchy. It takes quite a bit longer to
        compute.

        Use Fog Noise:
            If on, the fog is not uniform and has 3D noise variations in
            it.
        Noise Amplitude:
            #channels: /noise

            The amount of noise variation to add to the constant fog.
        Noise Frequency:
            #channels: /nfreq1 /nfreq2 /nfreq3

            How quickly the noise changes in each of the 3 axis. Lower
            values produce very smooth, gradually changing noise, while
            high values produce very static noise.
        Noise Offset:
            #channels: /noff1 /noff2 /noff3

            By changing the noise offset, you can animate the fog noise
            itself, which makes it flow as if wind were blowing it.
        Turbulence:
            #channels: /turb

            Adds more harmonics to the noise, given it more 'depth'. It
            will have more high frequency components in it.
        Roughness:
            #channels: /rough

            For each level of turbulence, this multiplies the noise
            harmonics. It controls the amount of high frequency noise
            present in the generated noise. So, for a turbulence of 3 a
            roughness of 0.5, the low frequency noise will be multiplied
            by 1, then next higher frequency by 0.5, and the highest
            frequency (level 2) by 0.25.
        Noise Step:
            #channels: /finc

            How often the noise is sampled along the way to the final
            point. If you have points that are extremely distant (>100),
            consider increasing this parameter, otherwise a tremendous
            amount of noise sampling will be done and the operation will
            slow down.
