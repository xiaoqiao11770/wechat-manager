= Defocus =

"""Defocuses an image similar to a real camera defocus."""

This operation defocuses an image similar to a real camera defocus.
Unlike blur, it flares the pixel outwards equally. The shape of the
flare can be circular, or that of a regular polygon, to model different
types of lenses.

Because computer images tend to have extremely bright spots clipped at
white, you can boost values above a certain threshold so that they
appear brighter than they actually are, mimicking the defocus circles of
a bright light source.

== Per Pixel Defocus ==

    Defocus can also be used with a matte to control the areas to
    defocus. When Per Pixel Defocus is on, the amount of defocus applied
    at each pixel ranges between 0 (matte is black) and the X/Y sizes
    (matte is white). Values in the matte above white or below black are
    clamped. This can be used very effectively for depth of field
    effects (especially in conjunction with a depth map and the Depth of
    Field COP - see 'Examples').

@parameters
    Defocus:
        #channels: /defocusx

        The amount of defocusing to apply (in pixels). This is the
        diameter of the defocus circle (or poly).
    Defocus Y:
        #channels: /defocusy

        If you would like to specify a different defocus size for the
        vertical direction, toggle on this parameter (useful for getting
        a motion blur defocus effect).
    Defocus Shape:
        The shape of the lens's circle of confusion.
    Polygon Edges:
        #channels: /polyedges

        If the defocus shape is a polygon, this is the number of edges
        that the regular polygon has.
    Lens Rotation:
        #channels: /lensrot

        If the defocus shape is a polygon, you can rotate the polygon
        shape to any orientation.
    Per Pixel Defocus:
        #channels: /masktolerance

        This option is enabled when a mask is used (Mask tab). It allows
        you to vary the amount of defocus applied based on the mask
        brightness.

        There is also a tolerance value which quantizes the defocus
        sizes. This can speed up the per-pixel defocus, especially when
        the mask is at a high bit depth (like floating point). It is
        expressed in defocus size; so a tolerance of 0.01 would have 500
        distinct defocus levels between 0 and a defocus size of 5 (0,
        0.01, 0.02, ... 4.99, 5). Higher tolerances produce faster
        composites, at the expense of image quality. Artifacts generally
        become noticeable around 0.1.

    Add Edge Ring:
        Adds a brighter ring area around the defocused area, to mimic a
        real lens.
    Ring Size:
        #channels: /ringsize

        The portion of the defocused area that will be visible as a
        bright ring (its proportional thickness). 0 is none, 1 is the
        entire area. Normally the ring is only a small portion of the
        defocused area (around 5%, or 0.05).
    Ring Intensity:
        #channels: /ringintensity

        The extra brightness of the ring (0 is none).
    Ring Offset:
        #channels: /ringoffset

        The ring can be biased more to one side of the bloom; a negative
        value shifts the bloom ring left or down, while a positive value
        shift the bloom ring right or up.
    Boost Intensity of Bright Spots:
        If on, values about a certain threshold are brightened to
        produce visible circles.
    Boost Threshold:
        #channels: /boostthresh

        All luminances above this value will be boosted.
    Boost Factor:
        #channels: /boostfact

        Multiplies the luminance above the threshold to produce the
        boost. Produces a more gradual boost.
    Boost Level:
        #channels: /boostlvl

        Boosts the luminance above the threshold amount by this value
        (by adding it to the luminance). Produces more abrupt changes in
        color, making the defocus shape stand out more from the image.
