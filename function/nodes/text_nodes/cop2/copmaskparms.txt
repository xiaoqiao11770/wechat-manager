    == Masking ==

        This operation may be masked, which restricts the operation to
        an area of the image. The mask may be inverted, brightened or
        dimmed.

        The mask input is on the side of the node. The label on the
        connector indicates the plane being used as a mask.

        The mask input can also be scaled to fit the output image's resolution, if they differ. If this node is changing constantly, and the mask is not, it is somewhat faster to put a [Scale COP|Node:cop2/scale] down to do the resize for the mask image. Otherwise, the scale will occur every time this node cooks.

    == Mask ==

        A mask can be chosen to limit the effect of the operator to
        areas defined by the mask. The mask can be taken from the mask
        input (side input) or from the first input itself.

        Effect Amount:
            #channels: /effectamount

            If no mask is present, this blends the output with the input
            by a constant amount (0 = all input, 1 = all output).

            If a mask is present, this amount multiplies the mask.

        Operation Mask:
            #channels: /maskinput /maskplane

            Selects the mask plane to use as a mask from the mask input.
            The mask can be selected from:

            A mask can be a component of a plane or an entire plane. If
            a vector plane is supplied as a mask, its components are
            multiplied by the images' components.

            *Scalar Mask ('A', 'C.r')*

            {{{
            C.r = I.r * M
            C.g = I.g * M
            C.b = I.b * M
            
            }}}
            *Vector Mask ('C')*

            {{{
            C.r = I.r * M.r
            C.g = I.g * M.g
            C.b = I.b * M.b
            
            }}}

            First Input:
                Useful for masking the operation to the image's own
                alpha plane.
            Mask Input:
                Selects the mask from the side mask input.
            Off:
                Turns off masking, without requiring disconnection of
                the mask input (useful for temporarily disabling the
                mask).
        Resize Mask to Fit Image:
            If the mask image is a different resolution than the output
            image, turning on this parameter will scale the mask to the
            output image's resolution.

            If this node is changing constantly, and the mask is not, it
            is somewhat faster to put a Scale COP down to do the resize
            for the mask image. Otherwise, the scale will occur every
            time this node cooks.

        Invert Mask:
            Inverts the mask so that all fully 'masked' portions become
            unmasked. This saves you from inserting an Invert COP after
            the node with the mask.
