"""Layers a series of inputs together by compositing them one by one on
the background image (input 1)."""

This operation does a series of composite operations (over, under,
inside, add, etc.) on the background image (input 1) using the foreground
images (inputs 2 and up). The compositing operation may be changed per
foreground input, and each foreground input has its own transform. The
first input is always the background image, and subsequent inputs are
composited in order. The size of the resulting image is the size of the
background image.

In the case of an over, the result image is:

{{{
4 over (3 over (2 over 1))
}}}
for four inputs, 1 to 4.


TIP:
    Tip: For a more traditional A over B method, use the [Composite
    COP|Node:cop2/composite].


@parameters

    == Composite ==

        Operation:
            Specifies the global compositing operation:

            Over:
                Places the foreground over the background.
            Under:
                Places the foreground under the background's alpha.
            Atop:
                Places the foreground over the background only where the
                background alpha exists.
            Inside:
                Places the foreground inside the background's alpha.
            Outside:
                Places the foreground outside the background's alpha.
            Screen:
                Acts as a saturating add, much like photographic
                addition.
            Add:
                Adds the foreground to the background.
            Subtract:
                Subtracts the foreground from the background.
            Diff:
                Takes the absolute difference between the foreground and
                the background.
            Multiply:
                Multiplies the background by the foreground.
            Minimum:
                Takes the minimum of the foreground and background.
            Maximum:
                Takes the maximum of the foreground and background.
            Average:
                Takes the average of the foreground and background.
            Xor:
                Takes the exclusive or of the two alpha planes, so that
                alpha areas that overlap are removed.
        Alpha Operation:
            Specifies the compositing operation for the alpha plane,
            which is normally the same as the global compositing
            operations (see above).
        Image Units:
            Selects pixels or UV units for the transforms.
        Image Filter:
            Specifies the filter to use when transforming.
        Motion Blur:
            Toggles on motion blur, and specifies the time range around
            the current frame to blur.
        Motion Frame Bias:
            Shifts the time range for the blur.
        Motion Blur Segments:
            Number of samples to blur together in the specified time
            range.
        Motion Blur Method:

            Velocity:
                Only uses the current frame and the transform to compute
                past and future positions.
            Deformation:
                Cooks the images at all time samples.

    == Transform (1 set per foreground input) ==

        Operation:
            Specifies the composite operation for this input. The
            default compositing operation is "global" which uses the
            operation specified on the Layer page.
        Alpha Operation:
            Specifies the composite operation for the alpha channel of
            this input. By default, this input's compositing operation
            is used (which also may point to the global compositing
            operation).
        Image Wrap:
            What this input shows when data outside its image bounds is
            needed.

            Repeat:
                Repeat the image again, as if tiled.
            Clamp:
                Holds the edge pixels' values (useful for ramps).
            Decal:
                Use black and zero alpha.
            Mirror:
                Repeat the image again, reversing it every other time.
        Translate, Rotate, Scale, Pivot:
            Transforms this foreground in X,Y relative to the
            background.

    == Merge ==

        Overview:
            These parameters specify how to build the output sequence
            when there are differences between the input sequences.
        Plane Merge:
            If the planes in the inputs differ, this specifies what the
            output planes should be.
        Raster Depth:
            If the raster depth for a given plane differs between
            inputs, this specifies what the output raster depth for the
            plane should be.
        Frame Range:
            If the frame ranges of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output range should be.
        Frame Rate:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            what the output frame rate should be.
        Frame Match:
            If the frame rates of the inputs differ, this determines
            which input frame to pick when the cook time doesn't reside
            on a frame boundary.
