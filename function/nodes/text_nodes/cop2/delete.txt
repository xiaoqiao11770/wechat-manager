= Delete =

"""Removes planes or components from an input sequence."""

This operation removes planes or components from an input sequence. This
operation does not use any cache memory; it simply acts as a selective
bypass.

Color and alpha planes or components cannot be removed; they will be
cleared instead (replaced with black).


@parameters
    Delete:
        Specifies whether to delete planes that were scoped or
        non-scoped.
    Plane Scope:
        The planes and/or components to delete or save.
