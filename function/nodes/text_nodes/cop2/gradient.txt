"""Computes the gradient of an image."""

Computes the gradient of the image, which indicates the direction of
greatest luminance increase in UV. The map produced looks like a bump
map.

The different maps produced by this operation are:

* *UV Gradient* - Computes the UV gradient of the image, which is a 2D
  vector which points in the direction of greatest luminance increase.
  The magnitude of the vector is the increase amount. Similar to the
  results produced by the Bump COP.

* *Normal Map* - Computes a normal map from the gradient. The normal and
  the gradient are similar: the normal is a normalized 3D vector with
  the Z component set to 1 and X & Y set to the U & V values of the
  gradient. The normal is then mapped from [-1,1] to [0,1] to match standard 
  normal map conventions.

* *Gradient Magnitude* - Computes the gradient magnitude, which appears
  as a luminance edge-detected image.

* *Thresholded Magnitude* - Computes the gradient magnitude and only
  accepts values between the low and high threshold values. If normalize
  is on, the values are mapped from low to high to 0 to 1.


@parameters
    Gradient Type:
        The channel used to compute the gradient. Normal Map can also use
        Displacement to convert XYZ displacements to normals. Displacement
        does not work for the other output modes and luminance will be used
        instead.
    Output:
        The type of output produced:

        UV Gradient:
            Computes the UV gradient of the image, which is a 2D vector
            which points in the direction of greatest luminance
            increase. The magnitude of the vector is the increase
            amount. Similar to the results produced by the Bump COP.
        Normal Map:
            Computes a normal map from the gradient. The normal and the
            gradient are similar: the normal is a normalized 3D vector
            with the Z component set to 1 and X & Y set to the U & V
            values of the gradient.
        Gradient Magnitude:
            Computes the gradient magnitude, which appears as a
            luminance edge-detected image.
        Thresholded Magnitude:
            Computes the gradient magnitude and only accepts values
            between the low and high threshold values. If normalize is
            on, the values are mapped from low to high to 0 to 1.
    Low/High Threshold:
        The low and high thresholds for thresholded magnitude output.
    Normalize:
        If UV Gradient output is used, this normalizes the gradient's
        magnitudes to 1. If Thresholded Magnitude is used, this maps the
        low to high range to 0 - 1.
