= Noise =

"""Generates continuous noise patterns."""

This COP generates continuous noise patterns. If an input is attached,
this COP will add a new plane to the sequence or modify an existing
plane.

TIP:
    Film grain should be added with the Grain COP.

@parameters

== Noise ==

Noise Type:
    Specifies the noise type.

    Hermite Interpolation:
        Fast, somewhat uniform.
    Sparse Convolution:
        Slower, more random.
    Improved Hermite:
        Fast, better randomness than Hermite Interpolation.
    Alligator:
        Slow, cell-like noise.
    Random (white):
        Random numbers per pixel.
Seed:
    #id: seed

    Random seed for the noise.
Noise Per Component:
    If on, different noise values are generated per component,
    otherwise, all components share the same pixel values.
Turbulence:
    #id: turb

    The number of noise generations to use.
Roughness:
    #id: rough

    The amplitude reduction of higher frequency noise
    contributions.
Exponent:
    #id: exp

    Raises the noise to the given exponent.
Spatial Frequency:
    #id: sfreq

    The scale of the noise; decreasing frequency increases
    feature size.
Spatial Offset:
    #id: soffset

    Allows you to pan around in the noise.
Frame Frequency:
    #id: tfreq

    How quickly the noise changes over time.
Frame Offset:
    #id: toffset

    Allows you to shift noise frames through time.
Amplitude:
    #id: amp

    Amplitude of the final noise intensity.
Shift:
    #id: shift

    Constant value added to all noise results.

Adjust for Aspect Ratio:
    If on, the noise is vertically stretched or squashed by the
    aspect ratio of the image (width/height) so that the noise
    isn't distorted.
