= Luma Matte =

"""Sets the alpha to the luminance of the color."""

Lumamatte computes the luminance of the color image, and stores it in
the alpha matte.

NOTE:
    A similar operation can be done with the Channel Copy COP.


@parameters

    == LumaMatte ==

        Luminance Range:
            #channels: /range1 /range2

            Allows you to extract a subrange of the luminance and fit
            it to the 0-1 range of the alpha matte.
        Redo Premultiply:
            If on, the image will first be divided by the original
            alpha, and then multiplied by the new alpha.
        Apply Premultiplies To:
            #channels: /premultscope

            Only redo the Premultiplication on these planes (normally
            color).
