Error Reduction:
    Controls recovery from invalid joint locations. 

Constraint Force Mixing:
    Helps fix singular simulations. 

Oversamples:
    Number of internal substeps to use to increase accuracy of the solve.

Random Seed:
    When the ODE solver needs to resolve something non-deterministically it uses this seed for the random number generator.

Clamp to Maximum Angular Velocity:
    Clamps the angular velocity value. This toggle is on by default. If this toggle is turned off, no clamping will occur.

Maximum Angular Velocity:
    The value of the maximum angular velocity.
