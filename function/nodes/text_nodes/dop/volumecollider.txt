= Volume/Volume Collider =

""" Defines a way of resolving collisions involving two rigid bodies
with volume. """

The Volume/Volume Collider DOP can be used to resolve collisions
between two rigid bodies containing volume.

The [Thin Plate/Thin Plate Collider DOP|Node:dop/thinplatecollider] is more appropriate for resolving collisions between two rigid bodies with negligible volume.
