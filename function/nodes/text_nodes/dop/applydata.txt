= Apply Data =

""" Attaches data to simulation objects or other data. """

The Apply Data DOP attaches one or more pieces of data to a set of
simulation objects, or to another piece of data.

The effect of attaching data to an object varies depending on the way
in which the data is attached, and the solver attached to the object.
For example, force data ([Fan Force|Node:dop/fan], [Gravity Force|Node:dop/gravity]) can be attached to an
object to influence the motion of the object. 

Geometry data may be
attached to give a form to the object so it can be used in collision
detection with other objects. Position or Motion data can be attached to
directly control the way an object moves through space.

Although data is primarily attached to an object for use by the
object's solver, there are no limitations on what kind of data can be
attached to an object. Any data that a solver doesn't have a specific
use for is simply ignored. 

This ability to attach arbitrary data to an
object can be used to hold state information that may be used elsewhere
in the hip file. It also means that an object can be switched from one
solver to another even if those solvers have different requirements on
the data attached to the object.

The effect of attaching data to other data varies depending on the way
in which the data is attached, and the solver attached to the object.
Generally data attached to other data modifies the behavior or the
parent data in some way. 

For example, Noise subdata can be attached to
most force data to add a random factor to the generated force. Or solver
data can be attached to a [Switch Solver|Node:dop/switchsolver] or [Blend Solver|Node:dop/blendsolver] to specify the
solvers to switch or blend between.


@parameters
    Activation:
        If this parameter is zero, the objects passing through this
        node are not altered in any way. No data is attached. 
        
        This parameter is evaluated for each object passing through this
        node, so this parameter may use object specific local variables
        to enable or disable the operation of this node on a per-object
        basis.
    Group:
        Only objects matching the Group string have data attached to
        them by this node. The Group string may be a series of space
        separated object group names, object names, or object ids.
        Wildcards, "?" and "*", can be used to match object names by
        pattern. 
        
        Any token can be preceded by the negation character,
        "^", in which case the objects matching that token are explicitly
        excluded. Only objects which match the __Group__ parameter and
        evaluate the __Activation__ parameter to a non-zero value are
        modified by this node. This parameter is only meaningful when
        attaching data to objects.
@inputs
    First:
        The first input to this node supplies the objects or data that
        will have new data attached to them.
    Subsequent:
        The remaining inputs to this node are the data that are to be
        attached to the objects or data on the first input.
@outputs
    First:
        The objects or data input to this node are sent through the
        single output, but with their new data attached.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
