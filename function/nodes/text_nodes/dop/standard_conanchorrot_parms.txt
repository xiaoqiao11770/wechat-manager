    Free to Rotate in Any Direction:
        The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
        in any way.
    Rotation Axis Lies on Plane (Specify Normal):
        The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
        in two dimensions. It may rotate any amount around any axis of
        rotation that lies in a plane. 
        
        The normal of the plane is
        defined by the __Constraint Direction__ parameter.
    Rotation Around Axis (Specify Axis):
        The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
        by rotating around an axis. 
        
        The axis is specified in the
        __Constraint Direction__ parameter.
    Rotation Fixed:
        The object is fully constrained to the orientation specified by
        this anchor.
Constraint Direction:
    #channels: /condirx /condiry /condirz

    Depending on the __Constraint Type__ parameter, this parameter
    defines either the permitted axis of rotation for the object, or the
    normal to the plane that defines the allowed axes of rotation for
    the object. If the __Constraint Type__ is __Free to Rotate in Any
    Direction__ or __Rotation Fixed__, then this parameter has no
    effect.
