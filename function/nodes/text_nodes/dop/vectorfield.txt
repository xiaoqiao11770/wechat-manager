"""Creates a vector field."""

The Vector Field DOP creates a Vector Field data that can be attached
to simulation objects and manipulated by solvers.  A Vector Field is
an axis-aligned box divided into individual voxels.  Each voxel is
giving a 3d vector.  The meaning of these numbers could
vary - they could represent force directions or a color field.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_gas_divisions]

    Voxel Sampling:
        The overall box will be divided into the specified number of
        small boxes, or voxels.  However, the question remains where
        on these voxels the field's vectors should be stored.

        Center:
            The vector will be stored at the center of each voxel.  The
            total number of samples thus matches the number of boxes.
        Faces:
            The vector will be split and each component will be stored
            on one of the voxel's faces.  The x component on the x
            face, the y component on the y face, and the z component
            on the z face.  
            
            Along that dimension the number of
            samples will be one higher to store the start and end
            voxel's face values.
        Edges:
            The vector will be split and each component will be stored
            on the center of one of the voxel's edges.
            
            The dimensions involved will be one
            larger to account for the boundaries.
        Corner:
            The value will be stored on the corners of each voxel.
            
            The number of samples will be one higher in each dimension
            than the division count to contain all the boundary
            values.
    Closed Ends:
        Determines the behavior of boundary values.  If set, the
        boundary will be enforced with the __External Direction__.
        Otherwise, the boundary is left free.

        X, Y, Z:
            When closed ends is set, these select which sides will be closed.

    Border Type:
	The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	defined box.

	Constant:
	    The external direction will be returned.
	Repeat:
	    The field will wrap, returning values from the
	    opposite side of the field.
	Streak:
	    The value at the edge of the field closest to the
	    sample will be returned.
	Extrapolated:
	    The value at the edge of the field closest to the sample
	    will be used.  However, it will then be added to the
	    dot product of the voxel size with the difference of voxel
	    indices.  This results in the correct extrapolation of
	    axis aligned rest fields.  For non-axis aligned rest
	    fields, the [Gas Rest DOP|Node:dop/gasrest] will set up the ratios properly.

    External Direction:
        What value to enforce on the boundary of the vector field.
	When first initialized, the vector field will be also set
	to this value.
    Tolerance:
        The absolute tolerance to use for lossy compression of the
        vector field.  This can reduce memory usage by detecting
        constant areas or using a lower bit-depth representation.  
        
        A value of 0 only allows lossless compression.
    Use 16bit Float:
	The tiles will be stored using a 16 bit float rather than 32
	bit float.  This uses half the memory, but at the cost of
	reduced precision and increased computation.  

	NOTE:
		All computations are still done in 32 bit floats.
