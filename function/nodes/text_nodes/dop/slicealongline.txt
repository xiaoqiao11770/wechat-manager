= Slice Along Line =

"""Divides a particle system uniformly into multiple slices along a
line.
"""

The Slice Along Line DOP specifies a line that will divide a
particle system into uniform slices.  This is used when distributing
particles across multiple computers to define which region of space is
handled by each machine.

@parameters
    Origin:
        The simulation space position for the center of the 
	line to build cutting planes along.
    Direction:
        The direction of the line to build the cutting planes along.
    Length:
	How long the line should be.
    Number of Regions:
	The number of slices that should be created.
