= Spring Constraint Relationship =

The Spring Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint. 

In a Spring Constraint Relationship, the solver applies forces in an attempt
to make the Anchor values equal. The amount of force exerted is related
to the distance between the Anchors.


@parameters

    == Data Options ==

        == Constraint Data ==
            Strength:
                #channels: /strength

                The larger the Strength value, the more force that is
                applied to the objects in a constraint for a given distance
                between the two Anchor values.
            Rest Length:
                #channels: /restlength

                This parameter allows this relationship to be satisfied
                when the Anchors are separated by a non-zero distance. 
                
                If this value is non-zero, then the Anchor values will actually
                be pushed apart in an attempt to maintain the specified rest
                length between them.
            Damping:
                #channels: /damping

                Controls how damped the spring modeled by this constraint
                relationship is.

        == Bullet Data ==
            The following parameters are used by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

            [Include:standard_bulletconstraint_parm#bulletSolverParms/]

    == Guide Options ==

        Radius:
            #channels: /rad

            Indicates the radius of the sphere that appears at the
            constraint anchor positions in the viewport as guide
            geometry. 
            
            Whether or not to display the guide geometry
            depends on the [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to
            which this relationship is attached.
        Color:
            #channels: /colorr /colorg /colorb

            Controls the color of the constraint guide geometry.
        Show Object Link:
            This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
            connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
