"""Defines how a Soft Body Object responds to collisions."""

The Soft Body Material Properties DOP defines how a soft body object (e.g., a cloth object) materials.

@parameters
    Stiffness:
    #channels: /stiffness

    The stiffness parameters define how strongly the cloth initially resists stretching/shearing/bending. The effect of stiffness is independent of the amount of detail in your cloth.

    The defaults for cloth stiffness work the best if you model the cloth to real size. If you don't model your cloth in meters, then make sure that you set the correct units of length in the Hip File Options. This should be done *before* you create your DOP network. When using real-size models, you should make sure that you have your length units set correctly before you create your DOP network: You should set the correct __Unit Length__ in __Edit__ > __Preferences__ > __Hip File Options__ before you create your DOP network.

    Each of the stiffness parameters assigns a uniform stiffness over the entire object. If you want to make parts of the object weaker or stronger, then you can locally multiply the stiffness using the point attributes `surfacestretchstiffness` `surfaceshearstiffness` `surfaceweakbendstiffness` `surfacestrongbendstiffness`.

    Damping:
    #channels: /damping

    The damping coefficients determine how fast the cloth loses energy due to deviations of stretch, shear, and bend over time. The higher the damping coefficients, the less the cloth oscillates and the quicker it will come to rest. The effect of damping is independent of your cloth resolution.

    As a rule of thumb, the damping coefficient should be at most ten percent of the corresponding stiffness coefficient.

    Each of the damping parameters assigns a uniform stiffness over the entire object. If you want to make parts of the object weaker or stronger, then use can locally multiply the damping using the point attributes `surfacestretchdamping` `surfacesheardamping` `surfaceweakbenddamping` `surfacestrongbenddamping`.
