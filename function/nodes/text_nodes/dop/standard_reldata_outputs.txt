First Output:
    The operation of this output depends on what inputs are connected to this
    node. 
    
    If an object stream is input to this node, the output is also an
    object stream containing the same objects as the input (but with the
    additional relationship created by this node). 
    
    If no object stream is
    connected to this node, the output is a relationship data output. This
    data output can be connected to an [Apply Relationship|Node:dop/applyrel]
    node to create many relationships at once.
