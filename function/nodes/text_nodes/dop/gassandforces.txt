"""A microsolver that computes the forces to treat the fluid simulation
as sand rather than fluid. """

The Gas Sand Forces DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Sand Forces DOP computes the local strain and pressure at each
point in the fluid. The fluid is then broken into a series of rigid
components whose strain is insufficient to separate the grains of sand.
These components velocities are projected to be rigid.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to update with the sand forces. This must be
        a vector field.
    Surface:
        A signed distance field that determines what voxels are inside
        or outside. Negative valued locations are considered inside.
    Pressure:
        The pressure of each voxel. This is often computed from the
        Project Non Divergent DOP as the pressure that was required to
        enforce incompressibility.
    Strain:
        This strain matrix field is computed from the velocity field
        according to the strain represented by the velocity field. This
        includes the shears that the velocity field represents.
    Friction Angle:
        Voxels that are not rigid still under go friction proportional
        to their stress. 

	The Friction Angle represents the scale of this
        friction. The Friction Angle is also used to determine at what
        effective rest angle the sand is considered to be rigid.
    Cohesive Strength:
        In addition to the friction angle, when determining if
        components should be classified as rigid, the cohesive strength
        is also used. While the friction angle represents how the sand
        grains stack and thus move rigidly, the cohesive strength
        measures how they stick together and hence for rigid clumps.
