= Gas Burn Geometry Object =

"""Creates an object with appropriate data to use as a fire source."""

The Gas Burn Geometry Object creates a DOP Object which has the
appropriate data to run a fire source simulation.

A fire source simulation will consume a fuel point attribute and turn
it into a source suitable volume fluid solvers.  The Gas Burn Geometry
DOP can be used as the solver to process this data.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_objcreation]

    == Source ==

	Deforming Object:
	    The DOP Object to use as the both the initial fuel source
	    and the current location of the object.  The fuel values
	    are only read on the creation frame as the consumed fuel
	    is stored on the local copy of the object.  The deforming
	    object's location and velocity is copied in every frame,
	    however, allowing the fuel source to be paired with a rbd
	    or cloth simulation.  Points should be consistent frame to
	    frame.

	Flamefront Reference:
	    The DOP Object, ideally a fire simulation, to use as the
	    reference grid to generate the source mask in.  This
	    ensures that the source information is evaluated at the
	    correct resolution and location.

	Temperature Source:
	    Optional fluid object to query for temperature values.
	    The temperature scalar field is copied from this object to
	    use as the reference temperature for determining when
	    things should ignite.

	    The temperature dest should be set to something other than
	    temperature to avoid having the source relationship writing back
	    the previous frames values.

    == Guides ==

        The source calculated from burning the object is displayed by
	default as a magenta isosurface.  A number of other
	visualization options are available.  The help for the Scalar Field
        Visualization provides more details about how these work.
