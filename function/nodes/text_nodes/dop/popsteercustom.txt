"""Applies forces to agents/particles calulated using a VOP network."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

The VOP network ends in a [Add Steer Force VOP|Node:vop/addsteerforce] with parameters/inputs for "Only Add" (boolean), "Steer Force" (float), and "Weight" (float). When "Only Add" is true, the steer force value is added to the existing steer force. When "Only Add" is false, the steer force value is multiplied by the weight and normalized by the crowd solver (see [crowd force weights|/crowds/weights]).
