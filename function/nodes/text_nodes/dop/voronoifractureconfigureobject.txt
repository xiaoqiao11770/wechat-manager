"""Attaches the appropriate data to make an object fractureable by the Voronoi Fracture Solver"""

The Voronoi Fracture Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object
and attaches the data which is needed for it to be dynamically
fractured by the [Voronoi Fracture
Solver|Node:dop/voronoifracturesolver], using impact data generated by
the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver].  It also creates new DOP objects
for any pieces created by fracturing [RBD Objects|Node:dop/rbdobject].

This DOP can be applied to any active [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] or
[RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject], including those created by
[RBD Point Object|Node:dop/rbdpointobject], [RBD Glue Object|Node:dop/rbdglueobject],
or [RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject].  

    NOTE: 
        The RBD Point, Glue, and Fractured Object DOPs create RBD Objects from geometry that are already comprised of distinct pieces at the SOP level.  The Voronoi Fracture Configure Object and Solver create objects by dynamically fracturing the geometry into pieces based on impacts during the simulation.

You can add noise to the [velocity impulse|#velocity] applied by this
DOP by connecting a [Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of the node, which adds the noise as subdata of the Voronoi Fracture data.

@parameters
    Group:
	Which objects to apply the configuration to.

    [Include:standard_voronoifracture_parms]

    Default Operation:
        Controls the __Parameter Operations__ for the underlying data.
        
    New Pieces Group:
	The name of the group to contain any newly created pieces from
	this DOP, for the timestep in which they are created.  This
	group can be used in subsequent DOPs to override any
	simulation values inherited from the pieces' parent object,
	using DOPs such as [RBD State|Node:dop/rbdstate] or [Physical
	Parameters|Node:dop/physparms].
