= Cloth Plasticity Properties =

"""Defines the plasticity properties."""

The Cloth Plasticity Properties DOP controls how the rest state of a [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject] may change over time during a cloth simulation.

@parameters
    Plasticity Threshold:
        #channels: /plasticitythreshold

        Controls the threshold above which the rest state starts to adapt. This is in units of length.

    Plasticity Rate:
        #channels: /plasticityrate

        The rate at which the rest state adapts itself when the __Plasticity Threshold__ is exceeded. This is in units of length over time.
