= Copy Object Information =

""" Mimics the information set by the Copy Object DOP. """

The Copy Object Information DOP creates a piece of data called CopyInfo
on a DOP object. This node provides a way to replicate that information
to allow you to mimic the operation of a Copy Object DOP using a different
set of DOP nodes. This is useful if the output of a Copy Object DOP needs
to be replaced with some other set of nodes, but following DOP nodes rely
on the copy information set by the Copy Object DOP.

@parameters
    Copy Number:
        The Copy Object DOP can create any number of copies of incoming
        source objects. This value is represents the index number of this
        particular object in that sequence of object copies.

    Source Object Id:
        The object identifier of the object that was copied to create this
        object. This identifier may refer to an object that was deleted
        by the Copy Object DOP.
