= Cloth Attach Constraint =

"""Constrains a set of points on a cloth object to the surface of a Static Object."""

This constraint can be used to attach a set of cloth points to the closest positions on surface of an animated Static Object (collision body). Cloth Attach Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

== Constraint ==

    Type:
        #channels: /type

        Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint. Hard constraints are always enforced. The involved cloth points are not affected by the solver. Soft constraints affect the cloth points by means of a force.

    Constrained Object:
        #channels: /constrainedobject

        The soft body object to be constrained.

    Constrained Points:
        #channels: /constrainedpoints

        The points in the soft body object to be constrained.

    Goal Object:
        #channels: /goalobject

        The static object to which the soft body object is attached.

    Goal Primitives:
        #channels: /goalprimitives

        The primitives on the goal object to which the soft body object may be attached.

== Soft Controls ==

Stiffness:
    In case the constraint type is soft, this controls how quickly the constraint point will adapt its position to the goal.

Damping:
    In case the constraint type is soft, this controls how quickly the constraint point will adapt its velocity to the goal. Using one percent of the stiffness usually gives a good starting point for this value.

== Guide Options ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in
    the viewport representing this constraint.

Radius:
    #channels: /guiderad

    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as
    guide geometry for this constraint.

Color:
    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

    Controls the color of the guide geometry.

Show Object Link:
    #channels: /showobjectlink

    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
