@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  

	The latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The object is created only when the current frame number is equal to this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be created.

    == Physical ==

    Density:
        #channels: /density

        The mass of an object is its volume times its density.

    Rotational Stiffness:
        #channels: /inertialtensorstiffness

        When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often
        acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the
        shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
        _inertial tensor_. 
        
        The Rotational Stiffness is a scale
        factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the
        object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it
        more ready to spin.
            
    Bounce:
        The elasticity of the object. If two objects of bounce 1.0 collide, they will rebound without losing energy. If two objects of bounce 0.0 collide, they will come to a standstill.

    Friction:
        The coefficient of friction of the object. A value of 0 means the object is frictionless.
