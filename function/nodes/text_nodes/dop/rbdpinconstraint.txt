= RBD Pin Constraint =

"""Constrains an RBD object a certain distance from the constraint."""

This involves constraining some location on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to a "goal"
location derived from another simulation object or from a position in
world space.

RBD Pin Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] used to determine the goal
            position. If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a location in world space which is used to
            calculate values for the local object space position of the
            constraint.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint in the goal
            object.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.
