= Gas Particle Move to Iso =

"""A microsolver that moves particles to lie along a certain isosurface
of an SDF."""

The Gas Particle Move to Iso DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that
allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to
extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may
attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Particle Move to Iso DOP moves particles along an SDF until
they reach a specific iso surface value. This can be used force
particles out of a surface or move them to a specific levelset.


@parameters
    Particles:
        The geometry containing the points that are to be moved.
    Point Group:
	An optional point group to specify which points will be moved.
    Isosurface Field:
        The SDF field that the particles are to be moved in. They will
        be moved along the gradient of this field until they reach the
        desired isosurface value within the desired tolerance.
    When to Move:
        Determines if the particles should be moved or not. Not equal
        will move all particles that do not lie on the isosurface
        already. Less will move all particles inside the surface to the
        surface, and Greater will move all particles outside of the
        surface to the surface.
    Goal Iso:
        The desired isosurface that all particles should be moved to.
        If the Isosurface Field is an SDF, this is the distance to the
        object with negative values lying inside the object.
    Tolerance:
        Particles stop being moved when they lie within this tolerance
        of the surface.
    Use Particle Scale:
        Instead of stopping when the particle lies on the isosurface,
        this option allows one to stop when the sphere described by the
        `pscale` attribute is tangent to the surface. The effective iso
        for the center of the particle is the __Goal Iso__ minus the `pscale`
        value.
    Delete Unmoveable Particles:
        It is possible for particles to not be able to move to the iso
        surface. Local minima may trap the particles away from the
        surface, for example. 

	Fields that are not proper SDFs may also
        fail to converge fast enough. Particles that failed to be moved
        are left at their original locations, or, optionally, deleted.
