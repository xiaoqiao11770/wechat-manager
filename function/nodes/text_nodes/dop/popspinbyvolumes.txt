= POP Spin by Volumes =

"""A POP node that uses the vorticity of velocity volumes to spin particles."""

The Spin by Volumes POP is designed to make it easy to add spin to a particle system from the vorticity of a fluid simulation.  Often the fluid simulation will be simulated as a separate pass and the velocity fields read off disk. However, the particles can be live-linked to an existing simulation.

This operator modifies the `torque`, `w`, `targetw`, `spinresist`, and `orient` attributes.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==

    Velocity Source:
        The source of the velocity volumes.  The context geometry refer to the inputs of this DOP Network.
    
    SOP:
        The SOP path which has three volumes to be interpreted as the x, y, and z components of the velocity field.  These are often the result of importing a velocity field from a fluid simulation.  You can directly link to a fluid simulation with something like `/obj/AutoDopNetwork:smoke/vel`.
    
    DOP Object:
        The name of a DOP Object in the same simulation as this.
    
    Field Name:
        The name of the velocity field in the DOP object.
    
    Vorticity Scale:
        A uniform scale to apply to the vorticity of the velocity field before any of the spin applications.
    
    Spin Type:
        There are several different ways to spin a particle system in response to vorticity from an external velocity field.  They are broadly categorized as Torque, Angular Velocity, and Orientation updates.

        Update Torque:
            Adjust the angular acceleration of the particles according to the torque scale, and the field vorticity.  This acts like the [Torque POP|Node:dop/poptorque].

        Update Angular Velocity:
            Directly change the angular velocity of the particles by blending in the field vorticity, causing them to swiftly match the velocity field.

        Update Orientation:
            Directly update the particle orientations.  This is useful as it allows the particles own angular velocity to be considered independently of the bulk fluid vorticity.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#treataswindtorqueParms/]
    
    Torque Scale:
        Scales the torque for torque update.
    
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#spinresistanceParms/]

    Angular Velocity Blend:
        In __Update Angular Velocity__ mode, the amount to mix the field vorticity into the particle angular velocity every timestep.
    
    Angular Velocity Update:
        In __Update Orientation__ mode the orientation of the particle is set directly from the field vorticity.  The angular velocity is set according to this parameter:

        No Change:
            The angular velocity is not updated.

        Final Velocity:
            The angular velocity is set from the vorticity of the velocity field.

            NOTE:
                The resulting angular velocity will be used by the particle integrator, so unless something special is done, this could result in double-rotating the particle.

        Zero:
            The angular velocity is set to zero.
        
    == Guide ==

    Show Guide:
        Controls if the guide geometry for this node should be shown. 
    
        NOTE:
            This can also be disabled by using the __Hidden__ flag on the DOP Node.

    Plane:
        What axis to extract from the volume.

    Offset:
        Where the plane should be positioned inside the volume.  This is a
        relative coordinate, with -1..1 being the total range, so 0 means the
        center of the volume.

    Resolution:
        The resolution of the visualization relative to the source velocity field.

    Scale:
        Scale the guide geometry by this amount.

    Range:
        The speeds that correspond to the beginning and end of the visualization colors.
