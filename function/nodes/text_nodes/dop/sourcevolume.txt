"""A microsolver that imports and directly applies SOP volume data."""

The Source Volume DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users may attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Source Volume DOP imports volumes and binds these to the specified DOP fields.
Any combination of volumes can be loaded and mapped. A set of default combinations are presented as presets.
These work together with the [Fluid Source operator|Node:sop/fluidsource]. Multiple Volume Source DOP microsolvers can be used to perform specific tasks, such as applying sources, sinks, or pumps directly from volumes created in SOPs, instead of relying on DOP specified relationships between objects.

NOTE:
    If the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] that the Source Volume operates on has instancing enabled, the sampled volumes are separated based on `volumename_instancenumber`. The volume name is specified under __SOP To DOP Bindings__ and the current instance number is fetched from the DOP object being processed. 

    This object should have data associated with it under the name `init_cluster`. The `init_cluster` name is unique to every object and is used to fetch the correct volume for sourcing. This data can be generated using the [Cluster SOP|Node:sop/cluster].
    
    If the correct volume is not found, nothing is sourced. If the `init_cluster` number doesn't match the correct volume to source from, a different volume might get used.

@parameters

Initialize:
    Configures the Source Volume microsolver according to the selected preset. Helps clarify and visualize the volume-to-field relationships.
    
Volume Path:
    The volume sample location. The specified node should contain the SOP volumes.
    
Activation:
    Controls if the source will be applied or not.  Mostly useful for liquid sources that can't be smoothly feathered in or out by controlling the scale source volume.

Scale Source Volume:
    Controls the scale of the (scalar) volume specified as a source volume to be added to scalar field X.
    
Scale Temperature:
    Controls the scale of the (scalar) volume specified as a temperature volume to be added to scalar field Y.
    
Scale Velocity:
    Controls the scale of the (vector) volume specified as a velocity volume to be added to vector field X,Y, and Z.
    
Use Object Transform:
    Takes into account animated objects.
    
== Volume operation ==

Source Volume:
    Controls how to add or blend the SOP source volume on to the specified DOP field.
    
Temperature Volume:
    Controls how to add or blend the SOP temperature volume on to the specified DOP field. 
    
Velocity:
    Controls how to add or blend the SOP velocity volume on to the specified DOP field.
    
    "Blended average" is a very non-realistic pump designed to to make it easy to blend in a desired goal velocity without overshooting or hard-constraint effects. It blends the speed (rather than velocity) of the source velocity with the current fluid velocity. Basically, the node tries to match the speeds of the source and the simulated fluid.

Target Speed:
    Available when __Velocity__ is "Blended Average". When the fluid is moving faster than this (m/s in in world space), the node will stop adding velocity.
    
Target Influence:
    Available when __Velocity__ is "Blended Average". A per-frame normalized value, `0..1`, where `0.5` means blend 0.5 times the source speed into the fluid velocity until the target speed is reached.

Max Acceleration:
    Available when __Velocity__ is "Blended Average". The maximum percentage of __Target speed__ the node can add per frame. After the amount of speed to add has been computed through the __Target influence__, that delta is then clamped to `targetspeed * max_acceleration`.

== Particle Operation ==

Source Particles:
    Add the points from the SOP specified by __Volume Path__ and the point group specified in __Source Group__.

Source Group:
    The point group from which to source particles.

Particle Fluid Object:
    The Particle Fluid Object node for the simulation to be affected.

    Source Volume uses this node to obtain information such as fluid particle attributes, parameters from the [Particle Fluid Object|Node:dop/particlefluidobject] node, etc.
    
Time Offset Scale:
    Offset any new particles by adding their scaled velocity multiplied by a random portion of the current timestep.
    This can help ensure the emitted stream of particles appears regular even at lower simulation substeps.
    
Time Offset Seed:
    The seed used to randomly offset the particles by their velocities.

Life Expectancy:
    If enabled, set the particles' `life` attribute to control how long the particle will live.  If sourcing particles
    to the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver], then __Apply POP Solver__ and __Reap Particles__ must be enabled on the solver
    for this attribute to have an effect.

Life Variance:
    Particles will live the number of seconds in __Life Expectancy__, plus or minus this number of seconds. Use 0 for no
    variance.

Kill Inside:
    Kill any particles within the specified DOP field SDF.  If __Source Particles__ is enabled, only particles added in the current timestep are eligible to be killed.
    If __Source Particles__ is disabled, all particles are eligible to be killed.

Stream Name:
    Any emitted particles will be placed in this group.

== Masks ==

Field to multiply the sourced volume with. By enabling __Absolute__ only parts of the source volume with a __Mask Field__ value lower then 0 are being considered (but not multiplied).

== SOP To DOP Bindings ==

Volumes:
    Specifies the SOP volume name to look for. In the case of Temperature and Density this must be a scalar volume, such as X.
    Velocity must be of a type vector, such as X.X, X.Y, X.Z.
    
Add To Field:
    Controls what field to add the sampled volume to. Source and Temperature volumes should be added to a scalar field. Velocity should be added to a vector field.

== Instancing ==

Instancing:
    When performing clustered simulations it is important that each
    cluster receives its own individual sources.  This is done by affixing 
    the cluster number to the named volume that is sourced.

    This option controls if this affixing of source names is performed.
    Auto-detect will attempt to determine it based on the smoke object's
    instancing setting.  However, some times one wishes to use the same
    source across many instances, in which cases this should be overridden
    to Off.

== Clear ==

Fields to clear:
    A space-separated list of fields to clear after sourcing operations. Not clearing `tempvel` or `source` enables visualizing them later on.
