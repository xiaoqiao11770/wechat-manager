= Switch Value =

The Switch Value DOP is used in conjunction with the [Switch Solver
DOP|Node:dop/switchsolver]. When using a Switch Solver to solve
simulation objects, there needs to be some data on each object to
specify which sub-solver of the Switch Solver to use for solving that
object. This DOP creates that data.


@parameters
    Switch Value:
        #channels: /switch

        This parameter is an index into the list of sub-solvers on the
        [Switch Solver|Node:dop/switchsolver] which should be used to
        solve the object.
