"""A microsolver that copies Impact data onto point attributes."""

The Gas Impact to Attributes DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Impact to Attributes DOP copies the Impacts data created by standard DOP collisions into attribute data.

NOTE:
    The __Add Impact Data__ parameter must be enabled on the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] DOP for this
    node to work with particles.  The [Gas Collision Detect|Node:dop/gascollisiondetect] DOP is an easier way
    to add collision attributes to particles.

@parameters

Geometry:
    The list of geometry to perform collision detection with.
    This can be a space separated or globbed list. 

    If the geometry is not a Geometry Copy, it will be converted into one so
    that it can be changed by this solver.

Attribute Prefix:
    All of the generated attribute names will have this prefixed onto them.

    For example, the number attribute base is `num`, so with the default
    `hit` prefix becomes `hitnum`.

Impacts:
    The data attached to this object that holds an Impacts record.  Often
    Impacts, but Feedbacks is also sometimes used.

Reset Hit Number:
    If set, the hit number attribute will be cleared out for all
    points prior to doing the collision detection.  Otherwise
    the number of hits will just accumulate.
    
Add Hit Num Attribute:
    Adds the integer attribute `hitnum` that stores the number
    of times the particle has collided.
Add Hit Pos Attribute:
    Adds the vector attribute `hitpos` that stores the position
    that the particle collided.
Add Hit Normal Attribute:
    Adds the vector attribute `hitnml` that stores the normal
    of the geometry at the time of the collision.
Add Hit Time Attribute:
    Adds the float attribute `hittime` that stores the time
    in seconds of the collision.
Add Hit Impulse Attribute:
    Adds the float attribute `hitimpulse` that stores the strength
    of the collision.  
    
    NOTE:
        This depends on the timestep.
Add Hit Path Attribute:
    Adds the string attribute `hitpath` that stores the object
    that the particle collided.  This is an op: path usable
    in VEX.
Add Hit Prim Attribute:
    Adds the integer attribute `hitprim` that stores the primitive
    hit by the particle.  -1 if the primitive cannot be determined.
Add Hit UV Attribute:
    Adds the vector attribute `hituv` that stores the parametric
    coordinates of where the primitive was hit.  This is not
    texture uvs.
