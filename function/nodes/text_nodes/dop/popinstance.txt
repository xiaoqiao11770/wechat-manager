= POP Instance =

"""A POP node that sets up the instancepath for particles."""

The POP Instance node sets the `instancepath` for particles, allowing them to be rendered with point instancing.

You can also use the Instance SOP to apply the instancing in SOPs.

The guide geometry for this node is created by the [POP Object|Node:dop/popobject], which is where you can disable it or change its default color.

The `orient` attribute is used to control the orientation of the instance.

This operator modifies the `instancepath` and `pscale` attributes.

For information on how to render instanced geometry, see the [Instance geometry on particles|/dopparticles/instancing] help page.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==

	Instance Path:
	    The SOP Path to instance onto the geometry.  Since this is available in the code snippet, it can be a prefix of the actual set of paths you wish to instance.

	Uniform Scale:
	    Allows you to change the `pscale` attribute which controls how big the instance is treated.
