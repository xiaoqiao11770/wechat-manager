= Fluid Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Fluid Objects to an object."""

The Fluid Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Fluid Object|Node:dop/fluidobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Fluid Object|Node:dop/fluidobject], except it allows you to
explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as
the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or
creating objects every 10 frames.

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the fluid simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the [Scalar Field
        Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
        details about how these work.

    == Initial Data ==

        SDF SOP Path:
            This is a path to the SOP that will be used to initialize
            the surface of the fluid. It should be a volume primitive
            which stores the signed distance to the fluid, such as that
            generated by the [Iso Offset SOP|Node:sop/isooffset] with the __Output SDF Volume__ option.
	Velocity SOP Path:
	    The path to the SOP that will initialize the velocity of
	    the fluid.  It should be three volume primitives which
	    store the x, y, and z components of the initial velocity
	    field.
        Use Object Transform:
            When sampling the surface SOP, determines if the relative
            transform between the surface SOP and the dop simulation
            should be taken into account.
        Closed Boundaries:
            The velocity field can be clamped to prevent any fluid from
            entering or leaving the box. If closed boundaries is not
            set, the velocity on the boundary will be allowed to vary,
            allowing fluid to leave the box.

            X, Y, Z:
                When closed boundaries is set, these select which
                sides will be closed.
	Border Type:
	    The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	    defined box.

	    Constant:
		The initial value will be returned.
	    Repeat:
		The field will wrap, returning values from the
		opposite side of the field.
	    Streak:
		The value at the edge of the field closest to the
		sample will be returned.
