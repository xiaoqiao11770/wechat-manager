"""A microsolver that scales down velocity, damping motion."""

The Gas Damp DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Damp DOP scales the velocity field by a number between 0 and 1, thereby
slowing down the motion in the simulation.

@parameters
    Use Mask Field:
	The amount of the damping will be scaled by this field.
    Field Name:
	The field to use as the damping scale.
    Field Influence:
	A scale to apply to the mask field.
    Time Scale:
	The amount of drag is scaled by the substep size, to try and make the
	damping effect substep independent.  The time scale provides a scalar
	override to this.
    Scale:
	The amount of damping to perform in a frame.  0.1 will remove 10%
	of the velocity.
    Correction Radius:
	Sudden changes in velocity result in artifacts in a sim.  Therefore, after
	the per-voxel damping amount is computed, it is blurred out by this
	correction radius to give a smooth transition.
    Target Speed:
	Velocities below this speed will not be damped.
    Velocity Bound:
	The remap drag ramp will be used to determine the scale of drag from
	the target speed to this speed.
    Remap Drag:
	This curve describes how much damping will be performed as the velocity
	increases.  The left is at target speed, the right at the velocity
	bound.  It is scaled against __Scale__.
    Remap Field Influence:
	The incoming field is mapped against this curve to determine its drag.
	The default inverted curve means high values of the field will not
	drag, while low values will drag.
