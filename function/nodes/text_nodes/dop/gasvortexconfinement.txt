= Gas Vortex Confinement =

"""Applies a vortex confinement force to a velocity field."""

The Gas Vortex Confinement DOP applies vortex confinement to a
velocity field.  This is a force which amplifies existing vortices
with the intent of undoing the diffusion that occurs during the
diffusion stages of the fluid solver.

@parameters

Velocity Field:
    The __Vector__ field to apply the vortex confinement term to.
    
Confinement Scale:
    The strength of the vortex confinement.
    
Confinement Field:
    The strength of vortex confinement can be varied over space by
    providing a __Scalar__ field here.
    
Clear Temporary Fields:
    Zeros the temporary fields when done to reduce memory usage.
    
Curl, Curl Magnitude, Vortex Direction:
    The name of the temporary fields to store intermediate steps
    needed in the calculation of vortex confinement.  These will
    be created with a Gas Match Fields so do not need to exist
    ahead of time.
