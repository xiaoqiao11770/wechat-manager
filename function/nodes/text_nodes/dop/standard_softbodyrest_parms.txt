Import Rest Geometry:
    #channels: /importrestgeometry

    Defines whether the rest state should be imported from a SOP geometry node. 

Rest Geometry Path:
    #channels: /restgeometrypath

    The path to the SOP node that will serve as the source of the rest positions. The number of points in the rest geometry may differ from the number of points in the simulation geometry, due to tearing and fracturing. However, the vertex numbers of the rest geometry must match the vertex numbers in the simulated geometry.
