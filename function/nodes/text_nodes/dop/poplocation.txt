= POP Location =

"""A POP solver that generates particles at a point."""

POP Location node generates particles for particle simulations.  Additional POP nodes can be wired after it and will implicitly only affect particles created by this node.

[Include:/shelf/dynamics_poplocation#includeme]

@parameters
    Position:
	Location in space to emit particles from.

    == Birth ==

        This operator has two methods for emitting particles. You can use these methods together or separately:

        * *Impulse* creates a certain number of particles each time the
          node cooks.

        * *Constant* creates a certain number of particles per second.

    == Attributes ==

        The parameters on this tab let you control which and how attributes are initialized on
        the emitted particles.
