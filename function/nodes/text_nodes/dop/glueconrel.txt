= Glue Constraint Relationship =

The Glue Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint relationship data types. These constraint relationships can be attached as subdata to a [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] node to control the relationships defined by the constraint network.

In a Glue Constraint Relationship, the objects move as one whole object until enough force is applied to break the glue bond.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Strength:
        Specifies the strength of the glue bond. If the value is -1, the connection will never break.
Half-Life:
        The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one half. Whenever a glued object gets hit, it accumulates a glue impulse force. This controls how fast that force decays.
Propagation Rate:
        Specifies how much the impacts propagate along each glue bond in a [Constraint Network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork].

== Guide Options ==

Color:
        Controls the color of the constraint guide geometry.
