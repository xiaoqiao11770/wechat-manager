= Gravity Force =

""" Applies a gravity-like force to objects. """

The Gravity Force DOP applies forces on objects as if they were inside
a gravity field. The amount of force is proportional to the object's
mass. If an object has twice the mass, it receives twice the force.
However, because an object of twice the mass requires twice the force to
experience the same net acceleration, the Gravity Force can be thought
of as a raw acceleration.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of this node, which adds
the noise as subdata of the force data.

@parameters
    Force:
        The amount of force to apply to a unit-massed object. Because
        the force is scaled by the mass, objects will undergo this
        acceleration.

        If your units are meters, seconds, and kilograms, -9.81 is a
        good value for Earth's gravity.

        If your units are feet, seconds, and pounds, -32 is a good
        value for Earth's gravity.

    Sampling Mode:
            Indicates the preferred sampling level (point, circle, or sphere) to trade accuracy for efficiency of the computation.
