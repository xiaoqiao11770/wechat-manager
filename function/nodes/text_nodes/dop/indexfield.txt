= Index Field =

"""Creates an index field."""

The Index Field DOP creates an Index Field data that can be attached
to simulation objects and manipulated by solvers.  A Index Field is
an axis-aligned box divided into individual voxels.  Each voxel is
giving an integer number.  The meaning of these numbers could
vary - they could store the number of points inside a voxel, or could
store the object id corresponding to a voxel value.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_gas_divisions]

    Voxel Sampling:
        The overall box will be divided into the specified number of
        small boxes, or voxels.  

	However, the question remains where
        on these voxels the field's values should be stored.

        Center:
            The value will be stored at the center of each voxel.  The
            total number of samples thus matches the number of boxes.
        Face X/Y/Z:
            The value will be stored on the center of the specified
            face of each voxel.  Along that dimension the number of
            samples will be one higher to store the start and end
            voxel's face values.
        Edge XY/XZ/YZ:    
            The value will be stored on the center of the specified
            edge of each voxel.  The dimensions involved will be one
            larger to account for the boundaries.
        Corner:
            The value will be stored on the corners of each voxel.
            
	    The number of samples will be one higher in each dimension
            than the division count to contain all the boundary
            values.
    Border Type:
	The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	defined box.

	Constant:
	    The initial value will be returned.
	Repeat:
	    The field will wrap, returning values from the
	    opposite side of the field.
	Streak:
	    The value at the edge of the field closest to the
	    sample will be returned.
    Initial Value:
        When first initialized, the index field will be set
        uniformly to this value.
