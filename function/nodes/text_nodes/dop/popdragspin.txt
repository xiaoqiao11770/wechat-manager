= POP Drag Spin =

"""A POP node that applies drag to the spin of particles."""

The POP Drag node defines a drag on the spin of particles.

This operator modifies the `targetw` and `spinresist` attributes.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==
	Axis Relative to Particle's Orientation:
	    The provided goal axis will be rotated into the particle's own reference frame.  Thus a value of (0, 1, 0) will be up in the space of the particle rather than in world space.
	Goal Axis:
	    The desired axis for the particle to spin around in its rest state.
	Goal Spin Speed:
	    How fast, in degrees per second, that the particle should spin around the given axis when it has reached its rest state.  If this is zero, it will drag the spin to a stop.
	    If it is positive, it will spin-up or down until it matches this.
	Spin Resistance:
	    How quickly the particle should match the goal spin speed.
