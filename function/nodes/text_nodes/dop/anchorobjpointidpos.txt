= Anchor: Object Point Id Position =

"""Defines a position by looking at the position of a point on the geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Id Position belongs to a class of DOP nodes
that define position or orientation values for use in building
constraints. This anchor defines a position by looking at the position
of a point on the geometry of a simulation object. The __Point Id__ and __Id
Attribute__ parameters are used to specify a point. The point with the
given value for the named attribute defines the position.

A common use for this type of anchor would be for particles which may
be created or destroyed during a simulation. By referencing a point
using the __Id Attribute__ rather than a point number, this anchor will
continue to refer to the same particle even when points are destroyed.


@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Geometry:
	#channels: /geometry
    
	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the point position.
    Initialize With World Space Position:
        Turning on this parameter causes this anchor to calculate a
        value for the __Point Id__ based on the supplied __World Space
        Position__. 
        
        To do this, the anchor finds the point on the geometry
        that is closest to the supplied __World Space Position__. The
        attribute value of that closest point is then used as the __Point
        Id__ value.
    World Space Position:
        #channels: /worldspaceposx /worldspaceposy /worldspaceposz

        When the __Initialize With World Space Position__ parameter is
        turned on, this value specifies the world space position used to
        find the closest point.
    Point Id:
        #channels: /pointid

        This value identifies the point on the geometry. The point with
        its __Id Attribute__ value equal to the value set here is the point
        used to calculate the position of this anchor.
    Id Attribute:
        #channels: /idattribname

        This parameter is the name of the attribute used to look for
        the __Point Id__ value.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

        Specifies an offset in object space from the geometry point
        position.
