= Anchor: Object Point Id Rotation =

"""Defines an orientation by looking at a point on the geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Id Rotation belongs to a class of DOP nodes
that define position or orientation values for use in building
constraints. This anchor defines an orientation by looking at a point on
the geometry of a simulation object. The __Point Id__ and __Id Attribute__
parameters are used to specify a point. The point with the given value
for the named attribute is used to define the orientation.

A common use for this type of anchor would be for particles which may
be created or destroyed during a simulation. By referencing a point
using the id attribute rather than a point number, this anchor will
continue to refer to the same particle even when points are destroyed.


@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Geometry:
	#channels: /geometry
	
	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the group of points.
    Point Id:
        #channels: /pointid

        This value identifies the point on the geometry. The point with
        its __Id Attribute__ value equal to the value set here is the point
        used to calculate the orientation of this anchor.
    Id Attribute:
        #channels: /idattribname

        This parameter is the name of the attribute used to look for
        the __Point Id__ value.
    Orient Attribute:
        #channels: /orientattribname

        Specifies the name of the quaternion attribute on the geometry
        that is used as the point orientation. 
        
        If this value is left
        blank, or specifies an attribute that does not exist on the
        geometry, the __Up__ and __Out__ Attributes are used instead.
    Up Attribute:
        #channels: /upattribname

        Specifies the name of the up vector attribute used to calculate
        the orientation of the point if the orient attribute is not
        specified.
    Out Attribute:
        #channels: /outattribname

        Specifies the name of the out (normal) vector attribute used to
        calculate the orientation of the point if the orient attribute
        is not specified.
    Rotation:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        This parameter specifies an offset to the orientation pulled
        from the point attributes.
