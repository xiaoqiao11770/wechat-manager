= RBD Angular Constraint =

"""Constrains an RBD object to a certain orientation."""

This involves constraining the orientation on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to
a "goal" orientation derived from another simulation object or from an
orientation in world space.

RBD Angular Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the RBD object to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an RBD object used to determine the goal
            orientation. If this parameter is left blank then the
            objects will be constrained to a world space orientation.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            goal position for the constraint.
        Goal Rotation:
            #channels: /goalrotationx /goalrotationy /goalrotationz

            Specifies a rotation in world space used to initialize the
            goal rotation for the constraint.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.
