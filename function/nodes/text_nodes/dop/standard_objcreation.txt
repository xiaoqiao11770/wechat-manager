Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
    Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini
    frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  The
    latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the
    DOP network level.
    
Creation Frame:
    The frame number on which the object will be created. The
    object is created only when the current frame number is equal to
    this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a
    timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be
    created. 
    
    For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the
    __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to
    `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame
    3.5.
    
Number of Objects:
    Instead of making a single object, you can create a number of
    identical objects. You can set each object's parameters
    individually by using the `$OBJID` expression.
    
Object Name:
    The name for the created object.  This is the name that shows up
    in the details view and is used to reference this particular
    object externally.  
    
    NOTE:
        While it is possible to have many objects with the same name, this complicates writing references, so it is recommended to use something like `$OBJID` in the name.

Solve On Creation Frame:
    For the newly created objects, this parameter controls whether
    or not the solver for that object should solve for the object on
    the timestep in which it was created. 
    
    Usually this parameter will be turned on if this node is creating objects in the middle of a simulation rather than creating objects for the initial state of the simulation.

Allow Caching:
    By preventing a large object from being cached, you can ensure
    there is enough room in the cache for the previous frames of its
    collision geometry.

    This option should only be set when you are working with a very large sim.
    It is much better just to use a larger memory cache if possible.
