= Spring Network Relationship =

"""Defines a spring relationship based on geometry."""

The spring network relationship is a low level tool to define 
spring relationships based on geometry.

The Spring Network Constraint DOP should likely be used instead of building
from this node.

Geometry subdata attached to this node will specify the constraint
network.  Like all relationships, a Solver named subdata can be
added to run a per frame solver on the relationship.  Each point in the
geometry represents a DOP object's point, according to the `name` and `pointid`
attributes.  Each two-point polygon represents a spring constraint.

== Attributes ==

You can [create attributes|/model/attributes] on the geometry to customize
each spring's behavior.  Most of these attributes allow fine-tuning of the
wire by scaling values set in this node.
