= Sand Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Sand Objects to an object."""

The Sand Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Sand Object|Node:dop/sandobject].

This DOP is very similar to the Sand Object, except it allows you to
explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as
the Empty Object DOP. This can be used for more advanced instancing or
creating objects every 10 frames.

    == Initial Data ==

        SOP Path:
            This is a path to the SOP that will be used to initialize
            the surface of the fluid. 
            
            It should be a volume primitive
            which stores the signed distance to the fluid, such as that
            generated by the [Iso Offset SOP|Node:sop/isooffset] with the __Output SDF Volume__ option.
        Closed Boundaries:
            The velocity field can be clamped to prevent any fluid from
            entering or leaving the box. 
            
            If closed boundaries is not
            set, the velocity on the boundary will be allowed to vary,
            allowing fluid to leave the box.

            X, Y, Z:
                When closed boundaries is set, these select which
                sides will be closed.

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the fluid simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the Scalar Field
        Visualization or Vector Field Visualization provides more
        details about how these work.

@inputs
    First:
        The simulation objects to turn into Sand objects by attaching
        the appropriate data.
@outputs
    First:
        The Sand object created by this node is sent through the
        single output.
