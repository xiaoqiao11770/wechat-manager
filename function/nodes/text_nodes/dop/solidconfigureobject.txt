= Solid Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Solid Objects to an object."""

The Solid Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Solid Object|Node:dop/solidobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Solid Object DOP|Node:dop/solidobject], except it allows you to explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or creating objects every 10 frames.

== Attributes ==

    You can [create attributes|/model/attributes] on the solid geometry (specified in SOP Path).
    Most of these attributes are multipliers for the global per-object values
    that are specified by parameters of the Solid Object.

    First:
        The simulation objects which were passed into this node are
        output with the data required for them to be considered cloth
