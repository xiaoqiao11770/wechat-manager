= Reference Frame Force =

""" Applies forces to an object according to the difference between
two reference frames. """

The Reference Frame Force DOP uses two reference frames to generate
the fictitious force that would transform one reference frame into the
other in a single timestep.

The original reference frame is specified by attaching Motion Data to
this force.  The goal reference frame is specified by specifying an
object whose "Position" named data will be used.  The difference
between the velocities of the two frames will be determined and a
force applied that seeks to move one frame to the other.

Creating fictitious forces in this manner allows one to have one
simulation that is in a fixed coordinate system inherit the behavior
of another simulation which is in a varying coordinate system.

The reference frames specified have to have velocity and angular velocity
information.  The [Object Position DOP|Node:dop/objpos] allows you to calculate these from a keyframed object transform.

NOTE:
    If your start/end frame velocities are the same, you won't get any reference force. To get around this you can use on [Object Position DOP|Node:dop/objpos] to refer to a keyframed pair of objects, one frame behind each other. The `chf()` expression can be used to auto-build the one frame old object.

@parameters

    == Data Options ==

        New Frame Object:
            Provides the name of the object to fetch the destination
            frame of reference from.  The "Position" data will be
            extracted from the named object.

	Position Data:
	    Specifies which position data on the new frame object to
	    use as the reference.

	Force Scale:
	    How much of the reference frame force to apply.  This is useful for toning down extreme transformations but still maintaining the general feel.
