"""A microsolver that adjusts an internal coordinate system attached
to fluid particles in a particle fluid simulation."""

The Gas Adjust Coordinate System DOP is a microsolver used to build
larger fluid simulations.  It is currently used to adjust an internal
coordinate system attached to fluid particles in the [Particle Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver].

@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which the
        coordinate system is to be adjusted.
