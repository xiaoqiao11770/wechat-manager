"""Defines a Crowd Trigger"""

Crowd Trigger defines a trigger or event that will cause the agents to change their [state|/crowds/states]. If the trigger evaluates to true, this will cause the [Crowd Transition|Node:dop/crowdtransition] node to activate.

@parameters
    Type:
        Specifies what the trigger is based on (object attribute, particle speed, time, etc.)

                    Trigger if agent is going inside the bounding shape.
                Outgoing:
                    Trigger if agent is going outside the bounding shape.

            Value:
                Value to be animated (int).
        Custom VEXpression:
                Lets you write custom wrangle code to manipulate when trigger is fired.

                Input 1, 2, 3, 4:
                    These control the four virtual inputs accessible inside of VOPs.

                    They can be accessed with the OpInput1-4 wires from the VOP, or with
                    the `@OpInput1-4` string parameters when using VEXpressions.

                    They can also be accessed numerically as 0-3 with VEX functions
                    that take an input number.

                    None:
                        No geometry is wired to this input.
                    SOP:
                        The SOP geometry will be cooked prior to running the VEX and
                        the result wired to this input.
                    DOP Data:
                        Data in the current simulation to reference.  Specified as
                        an object/data, for example, `pyro1/vel` to refer to the velocity
                        field of the `pyro1` object (which will show up as three volume
                        primitives).
                    Myself:
                        Referring to the geometry currently being processed is
                        special as you have to ensure a copy is made so the VEX
                        functions can refer to its original form.  This handles
                        that for you.
                    Nth Context Geometry:
                        These refer to the SOPs wired into the parent DOP Network itself.
                    Myself (No Reads from Outputs):
                        Refers the currently processed geometry.  Does not make a copy
                        so it is up to the user to ensure no reads are made from
                        any attributes that are bound.

                Evaluation Node Path:
                    VEX functions like `ch()` usually evaluate with respect to this node.
                    Providing a path here can override where the path search starts
                    from.  This is useful for embedding in a digital asset where you
                    would like the top level digital asset to be the search root.
    Trigger Name:
        The name of the trigger. This must be unique as each Crowd Trigger node creates its own `crowdtrigger_triggername` attribute.
