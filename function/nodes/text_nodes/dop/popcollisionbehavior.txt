= POP Collision Behavior =

"""A POP node that reacts to collisions."""

The POP Collision Behavior node performs operations based on collisions set in the hit attributes.

TIP:
        For simple RBD collisions, you can use the controls on the __Collision Behavior__ tab of the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver].

Typically, the [POP Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect] node is used to do both the collision detection and resolution.  However, this node can be useful when responding to DOP collisions created by the __Add Hit Attributes__ option of the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver].

NOTE:
        This does not handle dynamic collision response, such as bouncing. Instead, [static|Node:dop/staticobject] or [RBD objects|Node:dop/rbdobject] should be added to the system.

This operator modifies the `P`, `Cd`, `stopped`, `stuck`, `sliding`, `pospath`, `posuv`, and `posprim` attributes.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Behavior ==

	Group Name:
	    All particles that just hit, ie, `@numhit>0`, will be added to this
	    group.
	Preserve Group:
	    If the group isn't preserved, it is cleared out first so the only particles in the group will be those that just hit. If it is preserved, the group will accumulate all particles that ever hit.
	Color Hits:
	    Particles that are just hit will have their `Cd` attribute set to this value.  This is useful for quick visualization of hits.
	Add Hit Total:
	    Adds to the integer `hittotal` attribute any hits that occurred due to this collision detection.
	Move to Hit:
	    Often if you want to trigger an effect off a particle's collision, such as birthing more particles, you want the particle at its hit location, not where it ended up at the
	    end of the frame.  This will move the particle back to its hit location.  This consists of `@P = v@hitpos;`.
	Response:
	    Controls what happens to particles that collide

    
	    Die:
		Particles that hit will set the `dead` attribute to 1, causing them to be deleted during the reaping pass.
	    Stop:
		This sets the `stopped` attribute to 1.  Particles that stop will no longer integrate their velocity, position, orientation, or angular velocity.  They can still be moved directly. For example, by the [Look At POP|Node:dop/poplookat] in instantaneous mode.
	    Stick:
		Particles that hit will have the `stuck` attribute set to 1.  The `pospath`, `posprim`, and `posuv` attributes will be setup to point to the hit location, causing the integrator to keep moving the particles to their stuck location every frame.  Usually you also want to turn on __Move to Hit__ with this.
	    Slide:
		Particles that hit will have the `sliding` attribute set to 1.  The `pospath`, `posprim`, and `posuv` attributes will be setup to point to the hit location, causing the integrator to try to slide the particles along the surface.
