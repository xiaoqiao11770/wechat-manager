= Split Object =

""" Splits an incoming object stream into as many as four output
streams. """

The Split Object Stream DOP allows the objects on a single stream to be
split into up to four output streams. This is the opposite of what a
[Merge Objects DOP|Node:dop/merge] does. This node is useful for
creating networks that provide a better visual representation of what
the network is doing. 

Everything that can be done with the Split Object
Stream DOP can also be done using simulation object groups and
expressions in DOP node activation fields. Split Object Stream has the
advantage of visually showing which DOP nodes affect which objects. 

The object group approach has the advantage that the number of object groups
can be dynamic, and it is easier to create large numbers of object
groups than to create large numbers of object streams using this DOP.


@parameters
    Output Index:
        This parameter is evaluated for each object input to this node.
        The object is sent to the output stream corresponding to the
        value of this parameter. 
        
        Output indices start at zero. If the
        output index value for an object is less than zero or greater
        than three, the object is not sent to any of the output streams
        and so will be removed from the simulation. Since this
        parameter is evaluated for each object, object-specific local
        variables can be used.
@inputs
    First:
        The objects on the single incoming stream are split into one of
        the four output streams.
@outputs
    All:
        The objects on the single incoming stream are split into one of
        the four output streams.
@locals
