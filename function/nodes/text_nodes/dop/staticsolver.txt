= Static Solver =

The Static Solver DOP is a solver which does nothing to its objects at
each timestep. Although the behavior of the object is the same as if no
solver was attached to the object, it can be necessary to use this
solver when using a [Switch Solver|Node:dop/switchsolver] or [Blend
Solver|Node:dop/blendsolver]. When using those solvers, there is no way
to turn off solving other than using this Static Solver.
