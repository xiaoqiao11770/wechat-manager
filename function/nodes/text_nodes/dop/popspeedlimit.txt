= POP Speed Limit =

"""A POP node that sets the speed limits for particles."""

The POP Speed Limit node adds attributes to specify the maximum speed that particles can move.  This clamping is done after all the forces are integrated, so can be useful to tame unruly particles.

If the attributes are negative, no clamping is done.

This operator modifies the `speedmin`, `speedmax`, `spinmin`, and `spinmax` attributes.

@parameters
[Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

Minimum Speed:
    The slowest in units/second that a particle can move.  If it is slower than this it will be adjusted to this speed, but maintaining its direction.  
    
    NOTE:
        Stationary particles will not be affected.
Maximum Speed:
    The fastest, in units/second, that a particle can move.  If it is moving faster than this its velocity will be scaled down prior to moving the particle.
Minimum Spin:
    The slowest a particle is allowed to spin, in radians/second.  If it is slower than this, its rotation will be scaled up to match it, preserving the axis of rotation.  
    
    NOTE:
        Non-spinning particles will be unaffected.
Maximum Spin:
    The fastest a particle is allowed to spin, in radians/second.  If it is faster than this, its rotation will be scaled down to match it, preserving the axis of rotation.
