= POP Torque =

"""A POP node that applies torque to particles, causing them to spin."""

The POP Torque node applies a torque to particles that causes them to spin-up.

This operator modifies the `torque` attribute.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==
	Axis Relative to Particle's Orientation:
	    The provided goal axis will be rotated into the particle's own reference frame.  Thus a value of (0, 1, 0) will be up in the space of the particle rather than in world space.
	Amount:
	    How much to speed up the spin of the particle around the desired axis.

	    This is in radians/second^2, matching the internal torque attribute.
	Axis:
	    The desired axis to spin the particle around.
