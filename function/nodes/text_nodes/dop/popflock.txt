= POP Flock =

"""A POP node that applies a flocking algorithm to particles."""

The POP Flock node causes particles to flock together.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

    == Central Force ==

	Number of Centers:
	    The number of centers to break the particles into.  These form separate attractive groups. 
	    
	    NOTE:
	        Having more than one center significantly slows things down.
	        
	Central Attraction:
	    How strongly particles are attracted to their center.
	Central Peak Dist:
	    How far from the center that the particles attraction strength stops increasing.
	Central Max Dist:
	    Beyond this distance particles will no longer be attracted to their center.

    == Interaction Force ==

	Avoid Force:
	    How strongly particles try to avoid each other.
	Avoid Max Dist:
	    The distance at which particles start to avoid each other.
	Vel Match Force:
	    Controls how strongly particles try to match the speed and direction of their neighbors.
	Vel Match Max Dist:
	    How far away particles look to determine their neighbors to match velocity.
