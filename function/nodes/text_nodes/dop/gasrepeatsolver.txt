"""A microsolver that repeatedly solves its input."""

The Gas Repeat Solver DOP is a microsolver used in
building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users can try
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Repeat Solver will run the solvers attached to it multiple times, 
and each time the subsolvers will be provided the full timestep to run over.

The number of passes and the stopping condition can both vary on a per
object basis by using the SwitchValue data.

@parameters
    Minimum Passes:
	The minimum number of times the sub-solvers will be repeated.  Even if
	the while condition is not met, they will still be evaluated this
	number of times.  This acts as the default if the minimum solve pass
	data isn't present.

    Override Minimum with Data:
	The minimum pass will vary for each object according to a SwitchValue
	data attached to it.

    Minimum Solve Pass Data:
	The name of the SwitchValue data to be used as the minimum number of
	passes for each object.  If it is missing, the over all __Minimum Passes__
	parameter will be used.

    Solve Pass Data:
	This SwitchValue data will be created if not present on each object.
	It will have its switch value set to the current pass.  Passes start
	with 0.

    Continue to Repeat While Data True:
	After the minimum number of passes is complete, each additional pass
	will first test if the __While Data__ is not zero.  If it is, another pass
	will be performed.

    While Data:
	The SwitchValue data to look at to determine if solving should
	continue.

    Enable Maximum Passes:
	Since it is common for while conditions to not terminate, this can be
	used to put a global ceiling on the number of passes that will be
	performed.  

        NOTE:
            If the minimum is greater than the maximum, the minimum will still be performed.

    Maximum Passes:
	The maximum number of times to iterate over the sub solvers.
	
        NOTE:
            If the minimum is greater than the maximum, the minimum will still be performed.
