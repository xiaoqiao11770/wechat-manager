"""A microsolver that calculates a surface tension force proportional to
the curvature of the surface field."""

The Gas Surface Tension DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Surface Tension DOP calculates a surface tension force and
applies it to the velocity field. The force is present at the surface
boundary and is proportional to the curvature of the surface. The effect
is to push in on pimples and push out on dimples, thereby flattening the
surface.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to update with the surface tension force.
        This must be a vector field.
    Surface Field:
        A signed distance field representing the surface. The zero
        isocontour of this surface is used to determine where to apply
        the surface tension force.
    Surface Tension:
        The scale factor for the surface tension. 

	The resulting force
        is scaled by this, the curvature, the distance to the surface,
        and then applied in the direction of the surface gradient.
        Negative values will cause protrusions to be accentuated and will
        quickly become unstable.
