#type: include
Width:
    #channels: /visualizewidth
    Turn this on to visualize the wire's collision width in the viewport.
Width Color:
    #channels: /widthcolorr /widthcolorg /widthcolorb

Penetration:
    #channels: /visualizepenetration
    Turn this on to visualize the parts of the wire object which have collided, but which did not have the collision resolved.
Penetration Color:
    #channels: /penetrationcolorr /penetrationcolorg /penetrationcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for visualizing the wire's width in
    the viewport.
Force Scale:
    #channels: /forcescale

    This is used to define the scale of the force lines drawn in the
    viewport. Use a small value if the lines are too long and
    distracting, and a large value if you can't see any lines.
Torque Scale:
    #channels: /torquescale

    This is used to define the scale of the torque lines drawn in the
    viewport. Use a small value if the lines are too long and
    distracting, and a large value if you can't see any lines.
External Force:
    Turn this on to see external forces, applied by DOPs Force nodes
    (such as the [Fan DOP|Node:dop/fan]).
External Force Color:
    #channels: /fexternalcolorr /fexternalcolorg /fexternalcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for external forces in the
    viewport.
External Torque:
    Turn this on to see external torques, applied by DOPs Force nodes
    (such as the [Drag DOP|Node:dop/drag]).
External Torque Color:
    #channels: /texternalcolorr /texternalcolorg /texternalcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for external torques in the
    viewport.
Internal Force:
    Turn this on to see internal forces generated by a Wire Solver to
    resist stretching.
Internal Force Color:
    #channels: /finternalcolorr /finternalcolorg /finternalcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for internal forces in the
    viewport.
Internal Torque:
    Turn this on to see internal torques generated by a [Wire Solver|Node:dop/wiresolver] to resist bending.
Internal Torque Color:
    #channels: /tinternalcolorr /tinternalcolorg /tinternalcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for internal torques in the
    viewport.
Collision Force:
    Turn this on to see the force preventing collisions in the viewport. This includes wire/volume collisions, wire/wire collisions and self-collisions.
Collision Force Color:
    #channels: /fcollisioncolorr /fcollisioncolorg /fcollisioncolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for collision forces in the
    viewport.
Constraint Force:
    Turn this on to see forces generated by a [Wire Solver|Node:dop/wiresolver] to satisfy
    constraints.
Constraint Force Color:
    #channels: /fconstraintcolorr /fconstraintcolorg /fconstraintcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for constraint forces in the
    viewport.
Constraint Torque:
    Turn this on to see torques generated by a [Wire Solver|Node:dop/wiresolver] to satisfy constraints.
Constraint Torque Color:
    #channels: /tconstraintcolorr /tconstraintcolorg /tconstraintcolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for constraint torques in the
    viewport.
Impacts:
    Turn this on to see impacts in the viewport. The impacts may appear in strange locations: they are shown at the position where a collision _would_ have happened.
Impacts Scale:
    #channels: /impactsscale

    This is used to define the scale of the lines drawn in the viewport
    to show impacts. 
    
    Use a small value if the lines are too long and
    distracting, and a large value if you can't see the lines.
Impacts Color:
    #channels: /impactscolorr /impactscolorg /impactscolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for impacts in the viewport.
Show Substep Impacts:
    Use this to show all impacts during a DOPs step. The [wire solver|Node:dop/wiresolver] takes many substeps per DOPs step. If this is cleared, only the impacts for the current substep are shown.
Axis:
    Turn this on to see each point's orientation.
Axis Scale:
    #channels: /axisscale

    This is used to define the scale of the axis lines drawn in the
    viewport. Use a small value if the lines are too long and
    distracting, and a large value if you can't see any lines.
X Axis Color:
    #channels: /xaxiscolorr /xaxiscolorg /xaxiscolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for local x-axis.
Y Axis Color:
    #channels: /yaxiscolorr /yaxiscolorg /yaxiscolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for local y-axis.
Z Axis Color:
    #channels: /zaxiscolorr /zaxiscolorg /zaxiscolorb

    Use this parameter to choose the color for local z-axis.
