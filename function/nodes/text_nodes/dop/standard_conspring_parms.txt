== Spring ==

    Strength:
        #channels: /strength

        Controls how strongly the spring constraint acts on the
        constrained object to return the anchors to the rest length
        separation.
    Rest Length:
        #channels: /restlength

        Sets the rest length of the spring relationship. 
            
        The force
        applied on a constrained object by a solver will tend to
        keep the object this distance away from the goal.
    Damping:
        #channels: /damping

        Controls the amount of damping in the spring relationship.
        As damping increases, the spring constraint acts more slowly
        and oscillates less.
    Limit Force:
        #channels: /limitforce

        If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
        force applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds the maximum
        specified by the __Maximum Force__ parameter.
    Maximum Force:
        #channels: /maxforce

        Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. 
            
        If the force
        applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds this threshold,
        the constraint will be disabled.
    Limit Length:
        #channels: /limitlength

        If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
        distance between the two ends of this constraint exceeds the
        maximum specified by the __Maximum Length__ parameter.
    Maximum Length:
        #channels: /maxlength

        Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. 
            
        If the
        distance between the two ends of this constraint exceeds
        this threshold, the constraint will be disabled.
