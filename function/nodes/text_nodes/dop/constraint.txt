= Constraint =

The Constraint DOP is used to describe the constraints of a simulation
object. The Constraint DOP itself does not contain any of the
information about where or how an object is constrained. That
information must be attached as subdata to the constraint. 

A constraint
consists of one Relationship and two Anchor nodes. The Anchor nodes
control how the current position or orientation of the object is
calculated, and how the goal position or orientation is calculated. The
Relationship controls what the solver should do to make the anchor
values equal.

This node has been built into several higher level digital assets such
as the [RBD Pin Constraint|Node:dop/rbdpinconstraint].
These assets combine the Constraint DOP with the required Relationship
and Anchor data to create some of the more common constraints for a
particular type of simulation object.
But in spite of their differences, all of these assets simply
create one or more Constraint data with one Relationship and two Anchors
as subdata.
