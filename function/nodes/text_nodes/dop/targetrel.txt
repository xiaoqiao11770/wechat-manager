= Target Relationship =

The Target Relationship DOP is used by the Smoke and Fluid solvers to have
another simulation object act as a target for the smoke or fluid object.

For the target relationship to take effect, a [Gas Target Force DOP|Node:dop/gastargetforce] should be
added to the velocity input of the solver.
