= No Constraint Relationship =

The No Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint. In a
No Constraint Relationship, the solver does nothing to affect either
Anchor value. This relationship type is most useful in conjunction with
a [Two State Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/twostateconrel]. This
relationship makes it possible to effectively turn off a constraint when
a threshold condition is met and the Two State Relationship switches
states.
