"""A microsolver that equalizes the density of two fields."""

The Gas Equalize Density DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Equalize Density DOP scales a density field so that its total
density value will match a reference field.   This can be used to
preserve total smoke volume or to get two disparate volumes to match.

The volume of a smoke field is defined as the total of all the density
values times the size of each voxel.

@parameters
    Two Dimensional:
	If two dimensional areas will be computed rather than volumes
	to ensure the units remain independent of voxel resolution.
    Scale Goal Volume:
	The computed goal volume will be multiplied by this value.
	This is useful if you want to artificially increase the smoke
	volume compared to the reference.
    Add Goal Volume:
	This constant will be added to the computed and scaled goal
	volume to form the final volume the density field will be
	equalized with.  If scale goal volume is 0, this merely
	becomes the total goal volume.
    Limit Density Change/Change Per Second:
	Places a cap on the total change in density that can occur in
	one second.  This can avoid the smoke from suddenly jumping to
	a new goal volume.
    Density Change Rate:
	A multiplicative rate for how quickly the density tries to
	approach the goal.  A value of 1 means the density will
	attempt to scale immediately to the goal, a value of 0 means
	it will not scale at all to the goal.  A value of 0.5 means
	the density will try to get within 50% of the goal in one
	second.

    Fields:
	These parameters control what name will be used for the input
	fields and the internal fields.

	Density Field:
	    The field to scale so that its volume matches the goal.
	Goal Field:
	    The target field whose volume will be matched.
	Density Volume:
	    A constant field that is computed that stores the total
	    volume of the density.
	Goal Volume:
	    A constant field that is computed that stores the total
	    volume of the goal.
