= Fluid Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Fluid Objects to an object."""

The Fluid Object DOP creates a Fluid Object inside a DOP simulation. It
creates a new object and attaches the data which is needed for it to be
used as a Fluid Object.

The geometry object has to have volume to be a valid source for volume-based fluid. For example, volume-based smoke, fire, or liquid will not work on a [curve|Node:sop/curve]. However, this is not a requirement for particle based fluids.

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the fluid simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the Scalar Field
        Visualization or Vector Field Visualization provides more
        details about how these work.

    == Initial Data ==

        SDF SOP Path:
            This is a path to the SOP that will be used to initialize
            the surface of the fluid. It should be a volume primitive
            which stores the signed distance to the fluid, such as that
            generated by the [Iso Offset SOP|Node:sop/isooffset] with the Output SDF Volume
            option.
	Velocity SOP Path:
	    The path to the SOP that will initialize the velocity of
	    the fluid.  It should be three volume primitives which
	    store the x, y, and z components of the initial velocity
	    field.
        Use Object Transform:
            When sampling the surface SOP, determines if the relative
            transform between the surface SOP and the DOP simulation
            should be taken into account.
        Closed Boundaries:
            The velocity field can be clamped to prevent any fluid from
            entering or leaving the box. If closed boundaries is not
            set, the velocity on the boundary will be allowed to vary,
            allowing fluid to leave the box.
        
            X, Y, Z:
                When closed boundaries is set, these select which
                sides will be closed.
	Border Type:
	    The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	    defined box.

	    Constant:
		The initial value will be returned.
	    Repeat:
		The field will wrap, returning values from the
		opposite side of the field.
	    Streak:
		The value at the edge of the field closest to the
		sample will be returned.
