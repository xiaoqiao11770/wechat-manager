"""A microsolver that diffuses a field or point attribute. """

The Gas Diffuse DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The Fluid Solver and Smoke Solver[Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Diffuse DOP performs a diffusion operation on the field. This
will smooth out sharp discontinuities and spread out the values of the
field. On vector fields, such as a velocity field, this can simulate
viscosity as each voxel's velocity will be affected by its neighbor's
values.

It can also be used to perform diffusion on point attributes
on the particles of a particle fluid field.  The [Particle Fluid Solver
DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver] allows microsolvers such as this one to be added after the main solver
step to extend the simulation.

NOTE:
    If diffusing a point attribute it is important that the density
    attribute be already properly set by the Gas SPH Density node.
    This is done in the normal particlefluid solver, but if the
    diffuse occurs after some emitters, the newly emitted particles
    will not have a proper density value, introducing NANs into the
    system.


@parameters
    Field:
        The field to diffuse. This can be a scalar, vector, or matrix
        field. It can be a space delimited list of fields or a glob
        pattern.
    Geometry:
        The particle fluid geometry to perform diffusion on.  This
        must be used in conjunction with __Geometry Attribute__ to
        select a point attribute to diffuse.
    Geometry Attribute:
        The name of the point attribute to perform diffusion on
        in the specified particle fluid geometry.
    Attribute Type:
        The type of attribute specified in __Geometry Attribute__.
        Float and Vector attributes may be specified.
    Diffusion Rate:
        A measure of the amount of diffusion to perform. This is
        multiplied by the timestep to get the amount to perform on each
        timestep.
    CFL Condition:
        Diffusion with too large a timestep can be unstable. Since the
        right timestep depends on the size of the voxels, the CFL
        condition adjusts the timestep according to voxel size. A higher
        value will perform larger timesteps.
    Relaxation Method:
        Instead of the default diffusion operator, one can use the
        simpler relaxation method. The relaxation method uses the minimum iterations for its number of iterations as it is stable.
    Min Iterations:
        The minimum number of times to divide a timestep for diffusion.
    Max Iterations:
        The maximum number of times to divide up a timestep. 

	NOTE:
		If this clamp occurs, the CFL condition will be violated and the solution may become unstable. Unstable diffusion of a density field tends to result in a hash looking pattern.
