= RBD Fractured Object =

"""Creates a number of RBD Objects from SOP Geometry. These individual RBD Objects are created from the geometry name attributes. """

The RBD Fractured Object DOP creates multiple [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] inside the DOP simulation. It takes the geometry from the given SOP Path and breaks it into pieces according to the Group Mask.

NOTE:
    The RBD Fractured Object will make one object for each group. If you have meta groups such as inside and outside, try using `piece*` instead of `*`.

== Attributes ==

    You can  [create attributes|/model/attributes]  on the RBD object's
    geometry to influence its behavior. Most of these attributes allow
    fine-tuning of the RBD by overriding default values set in this
    node.

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini
        frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  The
        latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the
        DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The
        object is created only when the current frame number is equal to
        this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a
        timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be
        created. 

	For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the
        __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to
        `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame
        3.5.
    SOP Path:
        The path to a SOP (or an Object, in which case the display SOP
        is used) which will be the geometry for this object.
    Fracture By Name:
        The SOP's geometry is divided into one or more sub-objects. For
        every unique value of the name attribute, a sub-object will be created
        with only the primitives that have that attribute value.
    Group Mask:
        The SOP's geometry is divided into one or more sub-objects. For
        every group that matches this mask, a sub-object will be created
        with only the primitives that belong to that group.
    Use Deforming Geometry:
        #channels: /animategeo

        Causes the geometry for the object to be pulled from the chosen
        SOP at each timestep. If the SOP contains animated geometry, the
        RBD object's geometry will also animate. 

	If this option is used,
        the Use Point Velocity parameter of the RBD Solver should also
        be turned on to take into account the deformations when
        calculating collision responses.
    Use Object Transform:
        The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is
        applied to the geometry. This is useful if the initial location
        of the geometry is defined by an object transform. 

	If you want
        to transfer an object whose movement is defined at the object
        level, you should use the Object Position DOP instead.
    Create Active Objects:
        #channels: /active

        Sets the initial active state of the objects. An inactive
        object doesn't react to other objects in the simulation.

    Display Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport.  Does
        not reset the simulation when it is changed.

    == Initial State ==

        Position:
            Initial position in world space of the object.
        Rotation:
            Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ
            format.
        Velocity:
            Initial velocity of the object.
        Angular Velocity:
            Initial angular velocity of the object. This is the axis of
            rotation times the rate of rotation. Speed of rotation is
            measured in degrees per second, so a value of 360 will cause
            the object to rotate once per second.
        Inherit Velocity from Point Velocity:
            When one brings in a moving piece of geometry from an
            external source one does not always know the precise
            velocity and angular velocity. 

	    If this toggle is set, the
            point velocity attribute of the geometry will be used to
            calculate the estimated velocity and angular velocity of the
            object. This allows one to effect a smooth hand off even if
            the source geometry came from a sequence of geometries
            rather than a simulation.

    == Glue ==

        Glue to Object:
            The name of an object to glue to. If this is blank, the
            object is glued to no other object and acts normally. If it
            is the name of another RBD Object which it mutually affects,
            this object becomes glued to the other object. Its relative
            position to the other object is maintained by the solver.
        Glue Strength:
            The amount of accumulated force required to break a glue
            bond. A value of -1 will prevent the bond from ever
            breaking. A value of 0 will cause the bond to break with the
            first external force.
        Glue Impulse HalfLife:
            The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one
            half. Whenever a glued object gets hit, it accumulates a
            glue impulse force. This controls how fast that force
            decays.

    [Include:standard_bulletdata_parm]    

    == Physical ==

        Compute Mass:
            Determines if the mass will be calculated automatically
            from the object's volumetric representation and glued
            sub-objects.
        Density:
            The mass of an object is its volume times its density.
        Mass:
            The absolute mass of the object.
        Rotational Stiffness:
            When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often
            acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the
            shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
            _inertial tensor_. 

	    The Rotational Stiffness is a scale
            factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the
            object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it
            more ready to spin.
