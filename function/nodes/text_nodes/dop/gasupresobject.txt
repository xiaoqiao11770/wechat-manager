= Gas Upres Object =

"""Creates an Gas Upres Object from a low resolution fluid sim."""

The Gas Upres Object DOP creates an Gas Upres Object inside the DOP simulation.
It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a
properly conforming Gas Upres Object.  It is usually created with a
corresponding low resolution fluid object.

== Tips ==

* The initial parameters of the smoke object need to also be initial parameters on the upres object. 
* Any microsolvers that adjust temperature/density/fuel/burn need to be wired into both the upres object and the smoke solver
* Any sources/sinks need to apply to both the upres and the smoke solver.
* Pump forces and micro solvers that deal with velocity do not need to be wired into the upres solver.
* If you have a Position data on the upres object and are sourcing the low
  res simulation from disk or SOPs, you need to save out the low res simulation
  without the position transform.  Turn off the __Transform Geometry With
  Position Data__ on your import node to do this.

    Hide Linked UI:
	Because this object is usually linked to a base simulation,
	this button will hide the linked parameters to provide a
	cleaner interface.

    [Include:standard_gas_divisions]

    Import Density:
	If set, and if the fluid type is pyro, it will import the
	density field as lowresdensity to allow scale by density to
	work.

    Do Not Import Rest:
	If the upres solver will be generating its own rest field, it
	does not need to be imported from the base simulation.

    Accurate Smoke Model:
	If the upres solver is in pyro mode and accurate smoke model
	is set, the fuel field needs to be imported from the base sim.
	Otherwise the burn field is imported.

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the upres simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the [Scalar Field
        Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
        details about how these work.

	Of especial note is the Turbulence Field which is useful for
	understanding where the Gas Upres solver will add more detail
	to the simulation.

    == Initial Data ==

	Fluid Type:
	    Controls which fields will be imported from the base
	    simulation.  This should match the fluid type of the Gas
	    Upres solver.

	Source:
	    Where the object looks to find the base simulation.  It
	    can be a live DOP Object inside this simulation, a live
	    DOP Object inside another simulation (separate DOP
	    Network), a collection of named volumes in a SOP Path, or
	    read directly from a .bgeo sequence.

	Use 16bit Float:
	    Uses lower precision 16 bit floats to store the fields.
	    This uses half the memory but at the cost of slower
	    performance (<10%).

	Density, Temperature, Heat SOP Path:
	    These paths specify the initial conditions of the upres
	    object.
