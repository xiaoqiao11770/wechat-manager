= Ripple Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Ripple Objects to an object."""

The Ripple Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches the
data which is needed for it to be used as a Ripple Object.

This DOP is very similar to the [Ripple Object|Node:dop/rippleobject], except it allows you to
explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as
the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or
creating objects every 10 frames.


@parameters
    Initial SOP Path:
        The path to a SOP (or an Object, in which case the display SOP
        is used) which will be the initial ripple geometry.
    Rest SOP Path:
        The path to a SOP which will be the rest state of the wave
        equation.  Any rest springs will pull the ripple geometry
        towards this state.  It will also be used to determine the
        curvature for propagating ripples from point to point.
    Use Deforming Rest:
        Reloads the rest geometry every timestep.  By animating the
        rest geometry, one can add new bumps to the system without
        directly editing the current state.
    Use Object Transform:
        The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is
        applied to the geometry. This is useful if the initial location
        of the geometry is defined by an object transform. 
        
        If you want
        to transfer an object whose movement is defined at the object
        level, you should use the Object Position DOP instead.
    Position:
        Position in world space of the object.  This can be animated.
    Rotation:
        Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ
        format.  This can be animated.
    Pivot:
        Pivot in world space of the object.  This can be animated.
@inputs
    First:
        The simulation objects to turn into Ripple objects by attaching
        the appropriate data.
@outputs
    First:
        The simulation objects which were passed into this node are
        output with the data required for them to be considered Ripple
        Objects attached.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
