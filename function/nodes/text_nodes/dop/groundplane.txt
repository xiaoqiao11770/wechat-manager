= Ground Plane =

"""Creates a ground plane suitable for RBD or cloth simulations. """

The Ground Plane DOP creates a ground plane inside the DOP simulation.
It creates a new object that has a simple grid geometry attached to it.
The grid has a Volumetric Representation attached which simulates an
infinitely large plane. This can be used as a collision surface for RBD
or Cloth simulations.

Because the ground plane can be moved and reoriented, several ground
planes can be used to box in an object.

@parameters
Object Name:
    The name for the created object.
Display Proxy Geometry:
    The display of the proxy geometry can be turned off. 

    For more
    complicated adjustments of the display status, including
    enabling the rendering of the proxy geometry, use the [Rendering
    Parameters DOP|Node:dop/renderparms].
Color:
    The primitive color for the guide grid to be drawn in.
Grid Size:
    The scale factor for the guide grid. Note that the underlying
    volumetric representation will continue to infinity, unaffected
    by this scale factor. 

    Some culling methods, such as used by the
    [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver], look at the geometry to determine a bounding volume.
    These may require a larger grid to ensure the collision with the
    ground plane is tested.

== Initial State ==
    
    OBJ Path:
        Allows you to specify the position and rotation of the ground plane based on the position and rotation of an object at the scene level.
        
    Position:
        The center of the ground plane.
    Rotation:
        The orientation of the ground plane. This is in RX/RY/RZ
        format.
