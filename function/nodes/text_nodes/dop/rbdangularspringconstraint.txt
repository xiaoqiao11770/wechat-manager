= RBD Angular Spring Constraint =

"""Constrains an RBD object to have a certain orientation, but with
a set amount of springiness."""

This involves constraining the orientation of the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to
a "goal" orientation derived from another simulation object or from an
orientation in world space.

RBD Angular Spring Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the RBD object to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an RBD object used to determine the goal
            orientation. If this parameter is left blank then the
            objects will be constrained to a world space orientation.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a position in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            goal position for the constraint.
        Goal Rotation:
            #channels: /goalrotationx /goalrotationy /goalrotationz

            Specifies a rotation in world space used to initialize the
            goal rotation for the constraint.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.

    == Spring ==

        Strength:
            #channels: /strength

            Controls how strongly the spring constraint acts on the
            constrained object to return the anchors to the same
            orientation.
        Damping:
            #channels: /damping

            Controls the amount of damping in the spring relationship.
            As damping increases, the spring constraint acts more slowly
            and oscillates less.
        Rest Rotation:
            #channels: /restrotation

            Sets the rest angle between the object and goal. The force
            applied on a constrained object by a solver will tend to
            keep the object rotated by this amount relative to the goal
            object.
        Limit Torque:
            #channels: /limittorque

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            torque applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds the
            maximum specified by the "Maximum Torque" parameter.
        Maximum Torque:
            #channels: /maxtorque

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. If the
            torque applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds this
            threshold, the constraint will be disabled.
        Limit Rotation:
            #channels: /limitrotation

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            angle between the two constrained objects exceeds the
            maximum specified by the "Maximum Rotation" parameter.
        Maximum Rotation:
            #channels: /maxrotation

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. If the angle
            between the two constrained objects exceeds this threshold,
            the constraint will be disabled.
