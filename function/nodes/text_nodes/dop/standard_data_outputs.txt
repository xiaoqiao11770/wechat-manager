First Output:
    The operation of this output depends on what inputs are connected
    to this node. If an object stream is input to this node, the output
    is also an object stream containing the same objects as the input
    (but with the data from this node attached). 
    
    If no object stream is
    connected to this node, the output is a data output. This data
    output can be connected to an [Apply Data DOP|Node:dop/applydata],
    or connected directly to a data input of another data node, to
    attach the data from this node to an object or another piece of
    data.
