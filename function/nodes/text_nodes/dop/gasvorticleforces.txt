"""A microsolver that applies forces to a velocity field or geometry
according to vorticle geometry."""

The Gas Vorticle Forces DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Vorticle Forces DOP applies paddlewheel like forces around each
vorticle according to the vorticles attributes.

The purpose of vorticles is not to create new forces, but to maintain
vorticles that naturally occur and prevent them from dissipating due to artificial viscosity.

The `pscale` attribute is used to determine the radius of influence of
the vorticle. The `up` attribute is used to determine the orientation of
the paddlewheel. The `mag` attribute is used to scale the force of the
vorticle.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to update with the vorticle force. This must
        be a vector field.
    Particle Geometry:
        Instead of updating a velocity field with the vorticle forces,
        one can update a particle geometry's attributes with the
        vorticle forces. This allows vorticles to be applied to particle
        fluid objects.
    Vorticles:
        The geometry which contains the vorticles to apply. The
        vorticles should have the proper attributes set up on them.
    Point Group:
	An optional point group to specify which points in the vorticles
	geometry will contribute to the force.
    Confinement Strength:
        A global force strength modifier to adjust the overall force of
        the vorticles.
    Compute New Particle Velocity:
        When applying to a particle geometry, determines if the
        velocity attribute should be directly updated or if just the
        force attribute should be updated with the forces. Updating only
        the force attribute allows other nodes to do higher order
        integration.
