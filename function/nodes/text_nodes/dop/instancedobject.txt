= Instanced Object =

"""Creates DOP Objects according to instance attributes"""

The Instanced Object DOP uses the instance attribute of some SOP
Geometry to create objects. Rather than creating an object for each
point on the geometry, this node creates one object for each unique
instance attribute value. Each created object is given SOP geometry data
corresponding to the instance, but is not given any Position data.

To create a separate object for each point in the SOP geometry, use an
[RBD Point Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpointobject]. That asset uses an
Instanced Object DOP internally, followed by a [Copy Objects DOP|Node:dop/copyobject]. The
instancing and copying of objects is separated to allow the Sop Geometry
data attached to the objects to be shared, greatly reducing the memory
costs of a simulation that uses this approach.


@parameters
    Activation:
        #channels: /activation

        This node creates objects on any timestep when this parameter
        evaluates to a non-zero value. 

	Usually this parameter will be an
        expression involving the simulation time or simulation frame
        number to cause the objects to be created at a particular time.
    Source SOP Path:
        #channels: /sourcesoppath

        The SOP node which is used as the source for creating the
        instanced objects. The geometry in this node should have an
        instance point attribute on it.
    Default Instance:
        #channels: /defaultinstance

        If the specified geometry does not have an instance attribute,
        or a particular point on the geometry has an empty string as its
        instance attribute value, the value of this parameter is used
        instead.
    Use Object Transform:
        The created SOP Geometry data will have its Use Object
        Transform set to this parameter.
    Solve on Creation Frame:
        For the newly created objects, this parameter controls whether
        or not the solver for that object should solve for the object on
        the timestep in which it was created. 

	Usually this parameter
        will be turned on if this node is creating objects in the middle
        of a simulation rather than creating objects for the initial
        state of the simulation.
@outputs
    First:
        The objects created by this node are sent through the single
        output.
@locals
