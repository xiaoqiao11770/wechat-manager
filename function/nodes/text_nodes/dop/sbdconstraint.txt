= Soft Body (SBD) Constraint =

"""Constrains a set of points on a soft body object to a certain position using a hard constraint or soft constraint."""

This involves constraining a set of points on the soft body object 
(wire or cloth) to a "goal" location derived from animation on the object's 
geometry, another simulation object, or from a position in world space.

SBD Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

	Type:
	    #channels: /type

	    Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint.

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            The soft body object to be constrained.
        Constrained Points:
            #channels: /ptgroup

            The points in the soft body object to be constrained.
        Constrain To Animation:
            #channels: /useanimation

            Constrains points to animation present on the input geometry.  
            
            The __Use Animated Geometry__ parameter on the constrained object's
            node should be enabled to make the animation available to the DOP
            simulation.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            A soft body object used to determine the goal position. 
            
            If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Goal Points:
            #channels: /goalpts

            The points in the goal object to use for the goal
            location.  The goal points are paired with the constrained 
	    points in the order in which they are given.

	    If there are more constrained points than goal points, the 
	    "leftover" points are constrained to the last specified goal
	    point.  "Leftover" goal points will not be used.

            If no points are specified, the initial position of
            the constrained point should be used.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            A location in world space to which the soft body object
            will be constrained.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.

    == Guide Options ==

	Show Guide Geometry:
	    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in
	    the viewport representing this constraint.
	Radius:
	    #channels: /guiderad

	    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as
	    guide geometry for this constraint.
	Pin Color:
	    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

	    Controls the color of the guide geometry if using pin constraints.
	Spring Color:
	    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

	    Controls the color of the guide geometry if using spring constraints.
	Show Object Link:
	    #channels: /showobjectlink

	    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
