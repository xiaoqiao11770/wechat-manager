Import Target Geometry:
    #channels: /importtargetgeometry
    
    Defines whether the target state should be imported from a SOP geometry node.

Target Geometry Path:
    #channels: /targetgeometrypath
    
    The path to the SOP node that will serve as the source of the target positions and velocities. This target geometry needs to have a velocity attribute "v". For this, you could use a trail SOP that uses the central differencing option to generate velocities. Also, the vertex numbers of the rest geometry must match the vertex numbers in the simulated geometry.
 
Stiffness:
    #channels: /stiffness
    
    This coefficient determines how strongly the finite element solver tries to make the point positions match the target point positions. The solver creates an imaginary potential force for this purpose.

Damping:
    #channels: /damping
    
    This coefficient determines how strongly the finite element solver tries to make the point velocities match the target point velocities. The solver creates an imaginary dissipation force for this purpose.
