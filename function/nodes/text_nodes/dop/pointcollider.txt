= Point Collider =

The Point Collider DOP provides a collision detection algorithm that is
most often used by the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver]. It collides the
points of one object against either the [Volume|Node:dop/volume] of the
other object (if it exists) or uses ray casting against the surface of
the other object. Both objects use their previous timestep information
to determine their relative motion and detect collisions over the entire
timestep.


@parameters
    Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol

        When colliding with the surface of another object, this
        tolerance value is used by the ray intersection code. 

	Any time a point gets within this distance of the surface it is counted as a collision.
    Volume Offset:
        #channels: /volumeoffset

        When colliding points against a Volume representation, the
        surface of the volume is effectively pushed out by this amount.
        
	Like the __Tolerance__ value above, it causes a collision to be
        generated if a point comes within this distance of the real
        volume.
