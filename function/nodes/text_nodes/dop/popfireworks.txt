= POP Fireworks =

"""A POP node that creates a simple fireworks system."""

Other than being useful for a simple fireworks simulation, this provides a quick way to see something pretty, and can be useful as a source for testing a particle chain.

NOTE:
    The fireworks start bursting around 60 or 70 frames into the animation. If your animation is shorter than that, you won't see the explosions.
