"""A microsolver that calculates an adhoc buoyancy force and updates a
velocity field."""

The Gas Buoyancy DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Buoyancy DOP calculates an approximate buoyancy force dependent
on the temperature field and updates a velocity field according
to that force.

Given an ambient temperature `Ta`, temperature `T`, buoyancy lift
`l`, and buoyancy direction of `B`, the force will be:
`((l * (T-Ta)) * B`


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to update with the buoyancy force. This must
        be a vector field.
    Temperature:
        A scalar field specifying the temperature profile. The average
        of this field is computed dynamically, so it is the relative
        range of the field that matters, not the zero-point.
    Buoyancy Dir:
        The direction to apply the buoyancy force. This should
        correspond with the "up" direction. The direction will be
        normalized before use.
    Buoyancy Lift:
        The amount of upwards force a voxel whose temperature is 1 unit
        away from the ambient temperature will receive.
    Ambient Temperature:
	The reference temperature that governs if a force will be
	positive or negative.
