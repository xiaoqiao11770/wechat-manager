"""A microsolver that arbitrary simulation data between multiple
machines."""

The Gas Net Fetch Data DOP is a microsolver used in
building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Net Fetch Data DOP exchanges arbitrary data between
machines in a distributed simulation

@parameters
    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Source Peer:
	The machine number to fetch data from.  -1 means no fetching
	will be done by this machine (but it may still have others
	fetch from it)

    Source Object:
	The object name, in the source machine, to fetch data from.
	Usually this will match this machine's object names, but if
	different .hip files are different it might get more
	complicated.

    Source Data Name:
	The name of the data to fetch from the source machine.

    Dest Data Name:
	What to call the data after it is copied here.
