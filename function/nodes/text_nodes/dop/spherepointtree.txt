= Sphere Point Tree =

""" This builds a tree of spheres producing bounding information for a
point cloud. """

This builds a tree of spheres producing bounding information for a
point cloud. A point attribute named `nopointvolume` can be attached to
the geometry to exclude testing of individual points.


@parameters
    Convert To Poly:
        This enables conversion of primitive (such as spheres) in the
        geometry, into polygons. Only polygons are used for collision
        detection.
    Triangulate:
        When this flag is turned on, the geometry is triangulated.
    LOD:
        #channels: /polylod1 /polylod2

        The Level of Detail which is used to control the point density
        in the U and V directions.
    Add Barycenters:
        When this option is turned on, the barycenters are also
        included in the bounding spheres. A barycenter is not added when
        its primitive has all its points disabled for collisions.
