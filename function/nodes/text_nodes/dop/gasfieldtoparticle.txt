"""A microsolver that copies the values of a field into a point
attribute on geometry."""

The Gas Field to Particle DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Field to Particle DOP calculates the field value for each
particle in the geometry. The resulting field values is then mixed with
the particle's attribute value to get the new attribute value.


@parameters
    Particles:
        The geometry to affect the attributes of.
    Particle Group:
	Which points in the geometry to be affected.
    Attribute:
        The point attribute that will be written to. It should have the
        same dimension as the field. 

	A scalar field should be a float
        attribute, a vector field a 3 float or vector attribute, and a
        matrix field a 9 float attribute.

    Create Missing Attribute:
	If the point attribute does not exist, a point attribute of
	the field's dimension will be created.  If it is a vector
	field, a vector attribute is created.

    Source Field:
        The field to use as the source. If multiple fields are given,
        each is applied in turn.

    Preserve Angular Momentum:
        When transferring velocity from a vector field to particles,
        there is a loss of angular momentum if there are multiple velocity values
        for each particle.  Enabling this parameter will create three additional vector attributes
        on each particle representing the field's angular momentum, allowing better preservation
        of the velocity field when particles are transferred back to it with a subsequent
        [GasParticleToField|Node:dop/gasparticletofield] DOP with its __Use Angular Momentum__
        parameter enabled.

    Angular Momentum Prefix:
        The attribute storing the angular momentum for each axis is stored in a vector attribute
        named with the specified prefix.
