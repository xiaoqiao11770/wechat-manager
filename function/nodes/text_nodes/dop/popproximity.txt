= POP Proximity =

"""A POP node that sets attributes based on nearby particles."""

This operator sets attributes on the input particles that record which other particles are closest and how far away they are.

This operator modifies the `nearest`, `nearestdist`, and `numproximity` attributes.

== Parameters ==

[Include:standard_pop_parms#geoSourceParms/]

Add Nearest Neighbor Attribute:
    Sets the `nearest` attribute on each input particle to the ID of the nearest particle.  If no particles are within the __Maximum Distance__,  it will be set to -1. 
    
    NOTE:
        This does not include itself in this calculation.

Use Particle Id If Possible:
    The `nearest` attribute will be set to the `id` attribute of the  nearest particle.  This is stable over time as particles are created and destroyed, but requires more work to look up other attributes. If the `id` attribute is missing, the point number is used.  Disabling this toggle will cause the point number to always be used, making it easier to use a `point` expression on the result.

Add Nearest Distance Attribute:
    Sets the `nearestdist` attribute on each input particle to the distance to the nearest particle other than itself.

Add Number in Proximity Attribute:
    Sets the `numproximity` attribute on each input particle to the number of particles within the distance defined by the __Maximum Radius__ parameter below.  This will not exceed the 
    __Maximum Count__.

Maximum Distance:
    The farthest distance to search for particles.  Stopping the search early can speed things up when you know you don't care about far away particles.

Maximum Count:
    The maximum number of particles to look for when computing the number in proximity.  Capping this can speed up the search by allowing it to stop sooner.
