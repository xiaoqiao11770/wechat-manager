First Output:
    The output of this node should be wired into a solver chain.

    Merge nodes can be used to combine multiple solver chains.

    The final wiring should go into one of the green inputs of a full-solver, such as [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] or [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].
