"""A microsolver that calculates and applies feedback forces to collision geometry. """

The Gas Feedback DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users can attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Feedback DOP uses the pressure field created in solving the non-divergence equations to apply feedback forces to collision objects.  These impacts are added in the Feedback data on the
collision objects.  If they are mutual affectors, the DOP engine will then resimulate the collision objects with these feedbacks in mind, creating a two way coupling between the systems.

@parameters
    Pressure Field:
        The pressure field used to determine if, and how strong, the feedback forces should be.  It has to be aligned with the collision mask.
    Collision Mask:
        An SDF marking locations that are inside collision objects. These cells will be eligible for feedback forces.
    Collision Weights:
    	This field stores what percentage each voxel is inside the collision objects.  If present, it will be used in preference to __Collision Mask__, since it gives smoother feedback forces.
    Collision Index:
        An index field which contains the object ids for each collision object.  This enables the solver to determine where to attach the impact data.
    Feedback Scale:
        Roughly equivalent to density, this is a scale factor that controls how powerful the feedback forces will be.  A value of zero prevents any feedback from occurring.
