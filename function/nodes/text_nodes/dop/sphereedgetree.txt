= Sphere Edge Tree =

""" This builds a tree of spheres producing bounding information for an
edge cloud. """

This builds a tree of spheres producing bounding information for an
edge cloud. A point attribute named `noedgevolume` can be attached to
the geometry to exclude testing of individual edges against a volume
object. An edge is disabled for collision if either of its endpoints is
disabled.


@parameters
    Convert To Poly:
        This enables conversion of primitives (such as spheres) in the
        geometry, into polygons. Only polygons are used for collision
        detection.
    Triangulate:
        When this flag is turned on, the geometry is triangulated.
    LOD:
        #channels: /polylod1 /polylod2

        The Level of Detail which is used to control the point density
        in the U and V directions.
    Add Barycenters:
        When this option is turned on, the barycenters are also
        included in the bounding spheres.
