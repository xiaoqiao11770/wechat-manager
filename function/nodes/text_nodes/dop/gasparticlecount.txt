"""A microsolver that counts the number of particles in each voxel of a field."""

The Gas Particle Count DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Particle Count DOP counts the particles within each voxel of a field and
stores the particle count in that field.  It essentially performs a particle histogram,
with each voxel representing a bin.


@parameters
    Destination Field:
      The field within which to count particles and store the particle count values.
    Particles:
        The geometry containing the particles to count.
    Particle Group:
        An optional point group to specify which points will be counted.
