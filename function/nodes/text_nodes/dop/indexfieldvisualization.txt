= Index Field Visualization =

"""Visualizes an index field."""

The Index Field Visualization DOP visualizes an Index Field data.
The resulting visualization can allow one to determine how a field is
behaving over time, or can even be Object Merged into SOPs to produce
the final output.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry should be visualized at all.
    Bounding Box:
        Draws a bounding box encompassing the field.
    Bounding Box Hash:
        Adds hash marks along the axes leaving the origin of the
        bounding box marking the divisions between each voxel.  

	The hash marks are drawn larger for every tenth and every
        hundredth.
    Use Plane:
        Visualize by cutting a plane through the index field and
        coloring the points on the plane according to the index
        field's values.
    Plane Orientation:
        The orientation of the cutting plane for visualization.
    Plane Position:
        Where in space the center of the plane is.  It is always set
        to encompass the scalar field's bounds, so the only relevant
        axis is the one the plane's normal matches.
    Visualization Mode:
        How to convert the range of the index field into colors.

        Infra-Red:
            False color is used with blue being 0 and red being 1.
        White to Red:
            White is used for 0 and red is used for 1.
        Grayscale:
            Black is used for 0 and white is used for 1.
        Black Body:
            A black (0) to red to yellow to white (1) ramp is used.
        Unique Color:
            The guide range will be ignored.  Each index value will be
            assigned a unique color.
    Guide Range:
        Before applying the visualization coloring, the given range is
        compressed into the 0..1 range used by the coloring schemes.
        
	Setting this to 3..7 will cause values of 3 to be colored as
        if they were 0 and values of 7 to be colored as if they were
        1.
    Index to Visualize:
        If you are not using plane visualization, an iso surface will
        be built at this value.  It will surround the volume of the
        field that has a value equal to the index value.
    Color:
        The color to use in visualization.  The iso surface or smoke
        field will be colored with this color.
    Invert Iso:
        Inverts the sense of the iso surface. Instead of enclosing
        areas that are equal to the index value, it will enclose areas
        that are different from the index value.
