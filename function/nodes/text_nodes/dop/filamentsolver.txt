"""Evolves vortex filament geometry over time."""

This node "evolves" the position and shape of [vortex filaments|/dopparticles/filaments] by advecting the points of the filament polylines by the filaments' own velocity field.

The [Source Filaments|Node:dop/sourcefilaments] imports filament geometry into the network.
This node advects the points of the filament curves to create motion.
The [POP Advect by Filaments|Node:dop/popadvectbyfilaments] node then uses the velocity field created by the moving vortex filaments to move particles.

See the [filaments page|/dopparticles/filaments] for more information.

@parameters

Activation:
    Turns this node on and off. The node is only active if this value is
    greater than 0. This is useful to control the effect of this node with an
    [expression|/expressions].

== Update ==

Reconnect Distance:
    Increase this value if the simulation is generating too many polygon edges.

    The solver will attempt to reconnect filaments with approximately anti-parallel edges, as the effects of such edges approximately cancel out.
    This can prevent the number of polygon edges from increasing exponentially during the simulation.
    Increasing this value will cause filaments to be reconnected more aggressively.

Min Edge Length:
    Remove any edges shorter than this length by collapsing those edges to their center point.

Max Edge Length:
    Subdivide any filament edges that are longer than this length.

Cap Speed:
    Turn this on to limit the speed of the filament vertices.
    Set the speed limit in the __Speed Cap__ parameter.

Speed Cap:
    The maximum speed of a filament vertex (when __Cap Speed__ is on).

Timescale:
    An overall scale applied to the actual timestep.
    You can animate this value.

Filament Geometry:
    The name of the simulation data that contains the vortex filament geometry.
