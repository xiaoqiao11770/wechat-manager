"""A microsolver that adjusts the strength of elastic bonds between
pairs of particles in a fluid simulation."""

The Gas Adjust Elasticity DOP is a microsolver used to build larger
fluid simulations. It is currently used to adjust the strength of
elastic forces in the [Particle Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. It is responsible for
adjusting the strength of elastic bonds between pairs of particles by
dynamically adjusting their rest lengths.


@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which elastic
        forces are to be computed.
    Enable Elasticity:
        Enables or disables the adjustments performed by this DOP.
    Plasticity Constant:
        Controls the magnitude of changes to elastic rest lengths
        between pairs of particles. 

	A larger plasticity constant results
        in a larger deformation of pairwise elastic bonds when the
        particle set is stretched or compressed.
    Yield Ratio:
        Controls the amount of deformation that can be resisted by an
        elastic bond between a pair of particles. 

	For instance, if this
        parameter is set to 0.3, then an elastic bond can be stretched
        or compressed by 30% of its rest length before it begins to
        deform.
    Clamp Number of Springs:
	Limits the number of particle to particle springs that are
	created.  Since all particles need to have the same size
	attribute, without clamping many particles close together
	might result in significant memory usage.
    Max Springs:
	The maximum number of springs that can attach to any one
	particle.  If a particle has more close neighbours than this,
	they are connected in a closest-first basis.
    Use Particle IDs:
	Determines if the particle springs should store particle
	id numbers or point numbers.  Point numbers are faster to
	work with, but if points are deleted the springs become
	invalid.
