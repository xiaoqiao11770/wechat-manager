= Partition =

""" Creates simulation object groups based on an expression. """

The Partition DOP creates simulation object groups based on an
expression. For each object the __Group List__ parameter is evaluated. The
resulting string is treated as a space separated list of object group
names to which the object should be added.


@parameters
    Activation:
        When this parameter value is zero, this node does nothing.
        Because this node processes each object separately, object
        specific local variables can be used in this node.
    Group List:
        This parameter is evaluated for each object input to this node.
        The resulting string is treated as a space separated list of
        group names to which the object is added.
@inputs
    First:
        The objects that might be included in one or more of the groups
        are connected through the single input.
@outputs
    First:
        The same set of objects that feed into the input are sent out
        through the single output.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
