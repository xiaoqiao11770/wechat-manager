= Terrain Object =

"""Creates a Terrain Object from SOP Geometry."""

The Terrain Object DOP creates a static object inside the DOP simulation. This
node is just like the [Static Object DOP|Node:dop/staticobject] except that it
manipulates the source geometry to generate a useful volume representation
from thin geometry (such as a grid, or a grid modified with a [VEX Mountain
SOP|Node:sop/mountain]) which would not otherwise be able to generate a
useful volume representation. 

Volume representation provides better
interactions with other solvers in the simulation. To see the volume
representation created by this DOP (and ensure it provides a good match to the
source geometry), it is a good idea to turn on the __Show Collision Guide
Geometry__ parameter. A bad volume may be corrected by modifying the __Base Normal__
parameter.

The position and velocity of this object is extracted from the animated
transformation parameters of the source object. Thus a terrain object is not
necessarily stationary. It can move through the simulation, and even deform,
but is not affected by other objects in the simulation.

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini
        frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  
        
        The latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the
        DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The
        object is created only when the current frame number is equal to
        this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a
        timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be
        created. 
        
        For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the
        __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to
        `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame
        3.5.
    Object Name:
        The name for the created object.  This is the name that shows up
        in the details view and is used to reference this particular
        object externally.  
        
        NOTE:
            While it is possible to have many objects with the same name, this complicates writing references, so it is recommended to use something like `$OBJID` in the name.

    SOP Path:
        #channels: /soppath
        The path to a SOP (or an Object, in which case the display SOP
        is used) which will be the geometry for this object. 
        
        This parameter can also be a list of Object or SOP paths, and can
        include wild card specifications or operator groups or bundles.
        If multiple Objects or SOPs match this string, a separate
        simulation object will be created for each matching SOP.

    OBJ Path:
        #channels: /objpath
        The path to the object that is used to control the motion of the
        terrain object. The animated world space transformation of this object
        is used to position this object, and calculate its velocity.

    Base Normal:
        #channels: /basenormalx /basenormaly /basenormalz
        Defines the normal to the plane onto which the source surface is
        projected to generate the volume. This parameter is useful if the
        primary orientation of the source geometry is not along the Y axis.
        
        When manipulating this parameter, you should turn on the __Show
        Collision Guide Geometry__ parameter to see the volume representation
        that is being created.

    Use Deforming Geometry:
        #channels: /animategeo
        Causes the geometry for the object to be pulled from the chosen
        SOP at each timestep. If the SOP contains animated geometry, the
        terrain object's geometry will also animate.

    Create Active Object:
        #channels: /active
        Sets the initial active state of the object. An inactive object
        does not react to other objects in the simulation. If a terrain object
        is made active, it should be connected to a [Static Solver|Node:dop/staticsolver]. This solver
        causes the terrain object to behave as if it were inactive.

    Display Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport.  Does
        not reset the simulation when it is changed.

    Display Extrusion:
	    The terrain geometry is extruded along the base normal to create the final closed volume.  Displaying this extruded surface can help identify what the correct base normal is.
