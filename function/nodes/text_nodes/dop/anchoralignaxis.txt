= Anchor: Align Axis =

"""Defines an orientation that aligns an axis in object space with a second axis defined by the relative locations of two positional anchors."""

The Anchor: Align Axis DOP belongs to a class of DOP nodes that define
position or orientation values for use in building constraints. This
anchor defines an orientation that aligns an axis in object space with a
second axis defined by the relative locations of two positional anchors
which should be attached as subdata to this anchor.

As an example, this anchor can be used to describe a look-at
relationship between two objects. To do this, the __Object Axis__ parameter
would be set to (0, 0, -1), the negative z-axis. Then two Anchor: Object
Space Position nodes would be attached as subdata, one referring to the
object doing the look-at, the other referring to the object being looked
at. This anchor will thus defines an orientation that would rotate the
negative z-axis on the look-at object to point at the object being
looked at.

This node is always used in conjunction with a second anchor node and a
constraint relationship node. These three nodes are created as subdata
of a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to create a complete constraint that can be
processed by a solver.


@parameters
    Object Axis:
        #channels: /objectaxisx /objectaxisy /objectaxisz

        Indicates the object space axis that is supposed to be aligned
        with the axis defined by the two spatial anchors attached as
        subdata.
