= Soft Body Fracture Properties =

"""Defines how a Soft Body Object responds to collisions."""

The Soft Body Fracture Properties DOP defines how plastic deformation behaves for a soft body object, such as a cloth object.

@parameters
    Plasticity Threshold:
    #channels: /plasticitythreshold

    The threshold in units of length that determines when the rest state will adapt itself.

    Plasticity Rate:
    #channels: /plasticityrate

    A rate in units of length per time that determines how fast the rest state will adapt itself when the __Plasticity Threshold__ is exceeded.
