= Blend Factor =

The Blend Factor DOP is used in conjunction with the [Blend Solver DOP|Node:dop/blendsolver].
When using a Blend Solver to solve simulation objects, there needs to be
some data on each object to describe what contribution each sub-solver
makes to the overall blended solve operation. So for each sub-solver on
the Blend Solver, each object should also have a Blend Factor attached
to it. Blend Factors are matched with sub-solvers either by simple
ordering (first Blend Factor applies to first sub-solver) or by name
(the Blend Factor named subsolver1 applies to the sub-solver named
subsolver1).


@parameters
    Blend Factor:
        #channels: /blend

        Indicates the contribution of the sub-solver related to this
        Blend Factor to the overall blended solution. 
        
        The overall blended solution is obtained by calculating the weighted average
        of the individual sub-solver solutions.
        
    Use Blended Result From Last Timestep:
        At each timestep, the [Blend Solver|Node:dop/blendsolver] runs each sub-solver. 
        
        If this option is turned off, the object state at the start of each
        timestep is the result of the last timestep from that sub-solver
        only. The blended solve result is ignored. 
        
        Turning on this option causes the initial state for this sub-solver at each
        timestep to be set to the result of the blended solve from the
        previous timestep. Therefore, the result of
        this sub-solver will always be kept similar to the blended
        output rather than evolving completely independently.
