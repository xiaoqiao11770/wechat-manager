= Wire Angular Constraint =

"""Constrains a wire point's orientation to a certain direction."""

This involves constraining the orientation on the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] to
a "goal" orientation derived from animation on the Wire Object's
geometry, another simulation object or from an orientation in world space.

Wire Angular Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrained Points:
            #channels: /ptgroup

            Identifies the points in the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrain To Internal Animation:
            #channels: /useanimation

            Constrains points to animation present on the input geometry.  
            
            The __Use Animated Geometry__ parameter on the constrained Wire Object's
            node should be enabled to make the animation available to the DOP
            simulation.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an wire object used to determine the goal
            orientation. 
            
            If this parameter is left blank then the
            objects will be constrained to a world space orientation.
        Goal Points:
            #channels: /goalpts

            Identifies the points in the goal object to use for the goal
            orientation.  The constrained points are paired with the goal 
	    points in the order in which they are given.

	    If there are more constrained points than goal points, the
	    "leftover" points are constrained to the last specified goal
	    point.  "Leftover" goal points will not be used.

            If no points are specified, the initial orientation of
            the constrained point should be used.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint.
        Goal Rotation:
            #channels: /goalrotation

            Specifies the goal rotation for the constrained wire object.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.
