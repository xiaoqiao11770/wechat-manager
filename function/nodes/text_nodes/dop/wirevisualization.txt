= Wire Visualization =


The Wire Visualization DOP allows inspection of the behavior of the wire
simulation in the viewport. It can display internal and external forces
acting on the wire.

This DOP requires the [Wire Solver|Node:dop/wiresolver] to create force information on the wire geometry during solving. This is enabled using the various __Create
Attributes__ parameters on the [Wire Solver DOP|Node:dop/wiresolver]. The Visualization DOP can then inspect the wire behavior after simulation is complete.

See the helpcard for the [Wire Elasticity DOP|Node:dop/wireelasticity] for a description of the stretch and bend forces.
