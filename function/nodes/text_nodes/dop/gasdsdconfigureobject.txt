"""Attaches the appropriate data for Smoke Objects to become a flame
front based fire."""

The Gas DSD Configure Object DOP takes a smoke object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a flamefront based fire..

@parameters
    [Include:standard_gas_divisions]

    == Initial Data ==

        Flame Front:
            This is a path to the SOP that will be used to initialize
            the flamefront subdata. 
            
            It should be a volume object, such as
	    that generated by the [Iso Offset SOP|Node:sop/isooffset]
	    with the __Output Type__ set to SDF Volume.

	Detonation Speed:
	    The initial flame speed of the flamefront.  This is how
	    fast the flamefront moves in units per second.

	Border Type:
	    The behavior when the field is sampled outside of its
	    defined box.

	    Constant:
		The initial value will be returned.
	    Repeat:
		The field will wrap, returning values from the
		opposite side of the field.
	    Streak:
		The value at the edge of the field closest to the
		sample will be returned.
	Add Rest Field:
	    Adds an extra field called "rest" which can be used to
	    store rest positions for shaders.

	Scale Rest Res:
	    Scales the resolution of the rest field.  Using a lower
	    resolution rest field both reduces memory requirements of
	    the rest field and also stiffens the rest field. 

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the smoke simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the [Scalar Field
        Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
        details about how these work.

@inputs
    First:
        The smoke objects to turn into flame front fires by attaching
        the appropriate data.
@outputs
    First:
	The Smoke object with flamefront data created by this node is
	sent through the single output.
