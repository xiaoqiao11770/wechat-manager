        How Houdini constrains the object to the goal point.

        Hard Constraint:
            Keeps a constant distance between the object and the goal,
            as if they were attached by a rigid wire.
        Spring Constraint:
            Constrains the object as if it was attached to the goal by
            a spring.

            The __Spring Strength__ parameter controls how much the
            spring constrains the object. If this value is too low, the
            spring will not be able to pull the object, and it will act
            as if it wasn't constrained at all.

            For a 1 unit object at the default density, the spring
            strength should be around 3000-8000 to hold up an object
            against default gravity.

            Increase __Spring Damping__ to decrease unwanted
            oscillation and yo-yoing of the object.

        Two State Constraint:
            Acts as a hard constraint until certain forces are met,
            then acts like a spring constraint.

            The constraint switches between a hard and a spring
            constraint based on the motion of the constrained object:

            * When the constraint is hard, if the "pull" of the object
              goes beyond the __Two State Max Force__ value, the hard
              constraint will "let go" and turn into a spring
              constraint.

            * When the constraint is a spring, if the object gets within
              the __Two State Min Distance__ of the goal, the spring
              will turn into a hard constraint.

    Two State Initial State:
        #channels: /twostateinitial

        When using a two state constraint relationship, this parameter
        controls whether the constraint starts as a hard constraint or
        as a spring constraint.

        Hard Constraint:
            The two state constraint is initially treated like a hard
            constraint.
        Spring Constraint:
            The two state constraint is initially treated like a spring
            constraint.
    Two State Max Force:
        #channels: /twostateforce

        Sets the force threshold for changing a two state constraint
        from the hard constraint state to the spring constraint state.
    Two State Min Distance:
        #channels: /twostatemindistance

        Sets the distance threshold for changing a two state constraint
        from the spring constraint state to the hard constraint state.
    Spring Strength:
        #channels: /springstrength

        Controls how strongly the spring constraint acts on the
        constrained object to return the anchors to the rest length
        separation.
    Spring Damping:
        #channels: /springdamping

        Controls the amount of damping in the spring relationship. As
        damping increases, the spring constraint acts more slowly and
        oscillates less.
    Spring Rest Length:
        #channels: /springrestlength

        Sets the rest length of the spring relationship. The force
        applied on a constrained object by a solver will tend to keep
        the object this distance away from the goal.
