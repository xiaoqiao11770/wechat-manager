"""A microsolver that creates a feathered mask out of a field."""

The Gas Feather Field DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Feather Field DOP creates a feathered field out of a field.
The result will be a field one in the center and zero on the boundary,
with a smooth fall off between governed by the parameters.  This is
useful for masking operations.

@parameters
    Field:
	The __Scalar__ field to apply the feathering to.  The initial
	contents are irrelevant as they will be overriden by the
	feathered values.
    Inset:
	How far in from the outside boundary will be zero before it
	starts ramping up to one.
    Feather Width:
	The distance from where it stop being zero until it reaches
	one.
    Zero Boundary:
	If set, the boundary will be explicitly set to zero.
