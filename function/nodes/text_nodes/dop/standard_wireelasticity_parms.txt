Linear Spring Constant:
    #channels: /klinear

    This parameter defines how strongly the wire resists stretching.
Linear Damping Constant:
    #channels: /damplinear

    This parameter defines how strongly the wire resists oscillation due
    to stretch forces.
Angular Spring Constant:
    #channels: /kangular

    This parameter defines how strongly the wire resists bending.
Angular Damping Constant:
    #channels: /dampangular

    This parameter defines how strongly the wire resists oscillation due
    to bending forces.
Adjust For Length:
    #channels: /adjustforlength

    Enabling this parameter will adjust spring and damper strengths
    according to segment lengths. This allows wire flexibility behavior
    to be independent of segment resolution.
Adjust For Mass:
    #channels: /adjustformass

    Enabling this parameter will adjust spring and damper strengths
    according to segment masses. This allows wire flexibility behavior
    to be independent of mass.
