= POP Group =

"""A POP node that groups particles."""

The POP Group node creates a point group to provide a way to refer to a group of particles later by name.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    Group Name:
	The name of the group to create.  If this field is blank, no grouping will be done.

    Preserve Group:
	If the group is preserved, each frame new particles will be added to the group by this POP.  Otherwise the group is reset each time.

    == Rule ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the rule is active.
	VEXpression:
	    A local expression providing a rule for setting up group membership.  The `ingroup` variable should be assigned 1 if the particle should be made part of the group.

    == Bounding ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the particles will be grouped by a bounding region.
	
	Bounding Type:
	    The shape of the bounding region.

	    Bounding Box:
		A box of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Sphere:
		A sphere of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Object:
		Whether the point is inside the given object.
	    Bounding Volume:
		The object's volume primitive is used to determine if the point is inside.
	Center:
	    Center of the bounding primitive.
	Size:
	    Size of the bounding primitive.  This is a diameter, not radius.
        Object Source:
            The source of the bounding object's geometry. The context geometry refer to the inputs of this DOP network.
	SOP Path:
	    Path to the bounding object.
        DOP Object:
            The name of a DOP object in the same simulation as this.
        DOP Data:
            The subdata path for the geometry in the __DOP Object__.
	Iso Surface:
	    What volume value to threshold between inside and outside.
	Invert:
	    Inverts the sense of inside and outside for the group.  This is particularly useful with the volume bounding option and switching between a fog volume and an SDF volume.

    == Random ==
	Enable:
	    Controls if the rule is active.
	Behavior:
	    When particles pass the chance test, they will then either
	    be added to the group, or removed, according to this test.
	    Setting to remove allows you to remove points that are added
	    by the previous folders of the group test.
	Chance:
	    The probability that any particle will pass this test.
	    `0` means no particles will pass, `1` means all will pass.
	Seed:
	    The random seed used for grouping points.  The `id` attribute
	    is added to this implicitly.

    == Combine ==

    Combines different groups based on boolean operators.

    Group:
	This section allows you to create a new group out of existing groups. 
	Enter the group to operate on or create in the first field and the name of 
	the existing group in the field on the other side of the buttons. You can 
	either include the contents of the other group by selecting 
	 __Equals__ or everything that is not the other 
	group by selecting  __Equals all but__. Use 
	the fields below to combine additional groups.
