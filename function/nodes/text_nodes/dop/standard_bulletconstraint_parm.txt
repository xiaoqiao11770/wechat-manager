parameters id="cfmErpParms">>
    Constraint Force Mixing:
        Increasing this value will make the constraint spongier, and
        may increase the stability of the simulation. The constraint
        may be violated by an amount proportional to this parameter
        times the force that is needed to enforce the constraint.

    Error Reduction Parameter:
        Specifies what proportion of the constraint error will be fixed
        during the next simulation step. If ERP is set to 0,
        constrained objects will drift apart as the simulation
        proceeds. If ERP is set to 1, the solver will attempt to fix
        all constraint error during the next simulation step (however,
        this may result in instability in some situations). A value
        between 0.1 and 0.8 is recommended for most simulations.

parameters id="bulletSolverParms">>
    Constraint Iterations:
        If greater than zero, overrides the number of iterations performed by
        the constraint solver for this constraint. If some groups of
        constraints require more iterations than others, this parameter can be
        used instead of globally increasing the number of iterations on the
        [solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

    Disable Collisions:
        Disables collision detection between the constrained objects.

parameters id="angularMotorParms">>
    == Angular Motor ==
        Number of Motors:
            Specifies the number of axes that the angular motor is enabled for.

        Axis 1:
            The direction of the first axis of rotation in the local space of the objects.

        Axis 2:
            The direction of the second axis of rotation. This should be perpendicular to __Axis 1__. The third axis is calculated as the cross product of __Axis 1__ and __Axis 2__.

        Relative Angular Velocity:
            The target relative angular velocity around each of the enabled rotation axes.

        Max Impulse:
            The maximum impulse that the solver is allowed to apply to enforce the target angular velocity. This controls the strength of the motor.
