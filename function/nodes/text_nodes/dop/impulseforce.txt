= Impulse Force =

"""Applies an impulse to an object. """

The Impulse Force DOP applies a precise impulse to an object. Impulse
is force * time and thus corresponds to a change in momentum. An object
will receive force corresponding to the impulse divided by the timestep,
thereby causing the object to gain the specified momentum in a single
simulation step.

Because the Impulse Force acts discretely, one will most likely want to
animate the activation to activate it on specific frames. Alternatively,
it can be used send feedback between two simulations in a timestep
independent manner.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
Noise DOP to the second input of the node, which adds the noise as
subdata of the force data.
