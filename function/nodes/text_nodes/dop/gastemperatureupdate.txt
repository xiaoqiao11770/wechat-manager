= Gas Temperature Update =

"""Modifies the temperature of a FLIP over time."""

This node can modify the temperature of a FLIP fluid globally and diffuse temperatures within the simulation.

It optionally updates viscosity and/or density based on temperature.

@parameters

== Parameters ==

=== Cooling ===

Enable Cooling:
    #id: docooling
    Causes temperature to reduce globally over time, as controlled by the parameters below.

Outer Cooling Rate:
    #id: outercoolingrate
    The rate of cooling at the surface of the fluid.

    A value of `0.5` means `50%` cooling after `1/24th` of a second (`1` frame at `24fps`).

Inner Cooling Rate:
    #id: innercoolingrate
    The rate of cooling in the interior of the fluid. __Falloff Distance__ controls at which distance from the surface this is applied.

    A value of `0.5` means `50%` cooling after `1/24th` of a second (`1` frame at `24fps`).

Falloff Distance:
    #id: maxcoolingdist
    The distance at which __Inner Cooling Rate__ is applied. __Outer Cooling Rate__ is used at the surface, and a blend of the two between the surface and the __Falloff Distance__.

Falloff Decay:
    #id: coolingdistdecay
    Values above `1.0` cause more of the __Inner Cooling Rate__ to be applied in the region between the surface and the __Falloff Distance__.

=== Temperature Diffusion ===

Enable Temperature Diffusion:
    #id: diffusetemp
    Diffuse temperatures over time, causing hot regions to blend into cold regions and vice versa. For example, this will cause cooling at the surface of the fluid to spread into the interior.

Radius:
    #id: diffusionradius
    The diffusion radius in world units.

Heat Bias:
    #id: diffusionheatingbias
    The rate at which hotter areas will spread into colder areas due to diffusion.

Cold Bias:
    #id: diffusioncoolingbias
    The rate at which colder areas will spread into hotter areas due to diffusion.

=== Temperature To Viscosity ===

Map Temperature to Viscosity:
    #id: maptemptoviscosity
    Tie the viscosity of the fluid to it's temperature. Using the default settings, hotter fluid will flow more freely while colder fluid will be more viscous and eventually transition to nearly rigid behavior at a temperature of `0.0`.

Minimum Viscosity:
    #id: minviscosity
    The lowest viscosity value the fluid will reach when heated to a temperature of `1.0`.

Maximum Viscosity:
    #id: maxviscosity
    The highest viscosity value the fluid will reach when cooled to a temperature of `0.0`.

Solidify Threshold:
    #id: solidthreshold
    Regions of the fluid with a temperature below this threshold will receive a boost in viscosity. This results in highly viscous, nearly rigid behavior.

Ramp Remap:
    #id: enabletemptoviscosityramp
    Enables the __Temperature to Viscosity__ ramp below.

Temperature to Viscosity:
    #id: temptoviscosityramp
    This ramp can be used to control how temperatures between `0.0-1.0` are mapped to the Min/Max Viscosity range.

=== Density ===

Map Temperature To Density:
    #id: temptodensity
    Tie the density of the fluid to its temperature.

Temperature Range:
    #id: mintemptodensity
    The range of temperatures to map to density.

Density Range:
    #id: mindensity
    The range of densities to map to.

== Bindings ==

Lava Temperature Field:
    #id: lavatempfield
    Name of the temporary field used by __Temperature Diffusion__.

Surface Field:
    #id: surfacefield
    The name of the fluid's surface field.

Geometry:
    #id: geometry
    The name of the fluid's particle geometry.
