Initial Geometry:
    #channels: /soppath

    This geometry determines the initial simulated state of the object. It determines the initial position and velocity for each of the points.
    
    This is the geometry that is used for the computation of internal forces and for collision detection. Your cloth geometry should satisfy [guidelines|Node:dop/clothgeometry] that ensure a fast-running and good looking simulation.

    In many cases, you can use the [Remesh SOP|Node:sop/remesh] to help you create a suitable simulation mesh. When using triangulated geometry, it is recommended that you provide a `materialuv` point or vertex attribute to specify the directions of the cloth fabric.
