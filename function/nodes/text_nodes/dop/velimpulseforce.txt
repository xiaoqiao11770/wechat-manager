= Velocity Impulse Force =

"""Applies an impulse to an object. """

The Velocity Impulse Force DOP applies a precise impulse to an object, scaled
by that object's mass so as to cause a precise change in the object's velocity.
Impulse is force * time and thus corresponds to a change in momentum.

Multiplying this by mass results in a change in velocity.  An object will
receive force corresponding to the impulse divided by the timestep, multiplied
by the object's mass, thereby causing the object to gain the specified
velocity in a single simulation step.

Because the Velocity Impulse Force acts discretely, one will most likely want
to animate the activation to activate it on specific frames. Alternatively,
it can be used send feedback between two simulations in a timestep
independent manner.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of the node, which adds the noise as
subdata of the force data.
