= Fluid Force =

"""Applies forces to resist the current motion of soft body objects relative to a fluid."""

Use this operator to deform soft bodies (cloth and wires) with fluids. Fluid
Force is not required for fluid simulations that involve rigid bodies.

NOTE:
    The drag force generated by this operator is applied independently of the object's mass.  Light objects will be affected more than heavy objects.  If the drag value is very large with respect to the timestep, some solvers can experience instability.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise Field DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of this
node. Noise is added as subdata of the force data. To avoid changing the Drag
force away from the direction of motion, the [Noise Field DOP|Node:dop/noise] should have
__Generate Scalar Noise__ turned on.

@parameters

    == Force ==

        Fluid Object:
            #channels: /fluid

            Specifies the fluid object used to create the force. Both particle
            fluids and container-based fluids qualify as valid inputs.
        Scale Force:
            #channels: /forcescale

            The applied force is equal to the negative of the current
            velocity, scaled by the __Scale Force__ parameter.
        Sampling Mode:
            Allows you to choose between point, circle, or sphere as the sampling level.

    == Guide Options ==

        Show Guide Geometry:
            #channels: /showguide

            Enables the display of guide geometry for this force in the
            viewport. The guide geometry consists of a series of line
            segments that start at each point on the force geometry, and
            indicate the force values.
        Scale Force Vectors:
            #channels: /guideforcescale

            The force attribute values are scaled by this amount before
            being displayed. 

            NOTE:
                  The __Scale Force__ parameter is also used to scale the force attribute values for display.
        Force Vector Color:
            #channels: /guideforcecolorr /guideforcecolorg /guideforcecolorb

            Controls the color used to display the force vectors.
