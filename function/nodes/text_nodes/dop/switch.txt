= Switch =

""" Passes one of the input object or data streams to the output. """

The Switch DOP accepts any number of object or data streams as input,
and sends just one of them through to its output. All inputs connected
to this node must be of the same type, either objects or data, not a mix
of the two.

When objects are connected to the inputs, the objects on the other
streams are removed from the simulation. This can be used to easily
switch from simulating one set of objects to another part way through
the simulation. It can also be used to select from a variety of object
creation mechanisms.

When data streams are connected to the inputs, the switch parameter is
evaluated for each object that wants data from this node. This node can
be used to assign one of a set of data to each object based on some
information about each object, or even randomly.

NOTE:
    Use the [Switch Solver DOP|Node:dop/switchsolver] if switching between solvers.  Otherwise solve order can become inconsistent.

@parameters
    Select Input:
        The zero based index of the input number which should be passed
        through to the output. 
        
        When switching objects streams, this
        parameter is evaluated only once, and so cannot include any
        object specific local variables. 
        
        When switching data streams,
        this parameter is evaluated for each object attaching this data
        and so object specific local variables can be used.
@inputs
    All:
        The objects or data coming into the input specified by the
        Select Input parameter are passed through to the single output.
@outputs
    First:
        The objects or data coming into the input specified by the
        Select Input parameter are passed through to the single output.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
