= Copy Data Solver =

"""Sets and configures a Copy Data Solver."""

The Copy Data Solver DOP sets objects to use the Copy Data Solver. When
an object has this DOP as its "Solver" subdata, Houdini will solve the
object by copying data from one location to another within the object.
This solver is useful to solve an object using keyframed animation, or
by pulling data from other parts of Houdini.

In many cases, keyframed data can be applied directly to an object
without any Solver required for the object at all. For example you may
keyframe some Position data and attach it directly to an object with the
name Position. However if you are using a [Switch Solver|Node:dop/switchsolver] or [Blend Solver|Node:dop/blendsolver]
for the object, this direct manipulation of the Position data can not be
used. It would blindly overwrite the Position information at every
timestep even if the object was using an RBD Solver at the time.

Instead, the keyframed position data can be attached to the object with
another name, such as KeyFramedPosition. This KeyframedPosition data
will be ignored by other solvers, and so will not affect the object when
it is using an [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver]. When the object wants to switch from the RBD
Solver to keyframed data, the Solver would be switched to a Copy Data
Solver which would copy the KeyframedPosition data to the name Position,
the proper recognized location for position information.

NOTE:
	Only one piece of data can be copied with this solver. If one wants to copy multiple pieces of data, multiple Copy Data Solvers could be connected to a [Multiple Solver|Node:dop/multisolver].


@parameters
    Copy from Self:
	Use the object being solved as the data source.  Usually equivalent to
	$OBJID, but using $OBJID requires one to set the Solver Per Object
	which prevents mutual affectors from working with RBD.
    Source Object:
	The name of the object to copy from.  $OBJID will refer to this object,
	so copy from itself.
    Source Data:
        #channels: /srcdata

        Provides the name of the source data on the object that will be
        copied to the new location.
    Destination Data:
        #channels: /destdata

        Provides the name of the destination data location to which the
        source data will be copied.
