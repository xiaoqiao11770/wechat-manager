= Wire Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Wire Objects to an object."""

The Wire Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject], except it allows you to
explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as
the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or
creating objects every 10 frames.


@parameters
    [Include:standard_wireobjecttabs]

@inputs
    First:
        The simulation objects to turn into Wire objects by attaching
        the appropriate data.
@outputs
    First:
        The simulation objects which were passed into this node are
        output with the data required for them to be considered Wire
        Objects attached.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
