"""A microsolver that computes the cross product of two vector fields."""

The Gas Cross DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Cross DOP computes the cross product of two vector fields,
storing the result in the specified destination field.

@parameters
    Dest Field:
        The list of __Vector__ fields to store the result of the cross product.
        This can be a space separated or globbed list. 
    Source A:
	The list of __Vector__ fields for the left hand side of the
	cross product.
    Source B:
	The list of __Vector__ fields for the right hand side of the
	cross product.
