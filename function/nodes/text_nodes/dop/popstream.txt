= POP Stream =

"""A POP node that creates a new stream of particles."""

The POP Stream node defines a new stream of particles.  This lets you wire nodes after this that will implicitly operate on the subset of particles that it defines.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    Preserve Stream:
	If the stream is preserved, each frame new particles will be added to the stream by this POP.  Otherwise the stream is reset each time.

    == Rule ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the rule is active.
	VEXpression:
	    A local expression providing a rule for setting up group membership.  The `ingroup` variable should be assigned 1 if the particle should be made part of the group.

    == Bounding ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the particles will be grouped by a bounding region.
	
	Bounding Type:
	    The shape of the bounding region.

	    Bounding Box:
		A box of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Sphere:
		A sphere of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Object:
		Whether the point is inside the given object.
	    Bounding Volume:
		The object's volume primitive is used to determine if the point is inside.
	Center:
	    Center of the bounding primitive.
	Size:
	    Size of the bounding primitive.  This is a diameter, not radius.
	SOP Path:
	    Path to the bounding object.
	Iso Surface:
	    What volume value to threshold between inside and outside.
	Invert:
	    Inverts the sense of inside and outside for the group.  This is particularly useful with the volume bounding option and switching between a fog volume and an SDF volume.

@inputs
    First Input:
	The first input is a reference input.  This means it does not count against the rule that there must be one solid line to the solver.  This lets one easily fork a particle network into two chains which terminate at the same [Merge DOP|Node:dop/merge].
