Data Name:
    Indicates the name that should be used to attach the data to an
    object or other piece of data. If the Data Name contains a "/" (or
    several), that indicates traversing inside subdata. 
    
    For example, if the [Fan Force DOP|Node:dop/fan] has the default Data Name
    "Forces/Fan". This attaches the data with the name "Fan" to an
    existing piece of data named "Forces". If no data named "Forces"
    exists, a simple piece of container data is created to hold the
    "Fan" subdata.

    Different pieces of data have different requirements on what names
    should be used for them. Except in very rare situations, the default
    value should be used. Some exceptions are described with particular
    pieces of data or with solvers that make use of some particular type
    of data.

Unique Data Name:
    Turning on this parameter modifies the __Data Name__ parameter
    value to ensure that the data created by this node is attached with
    a unique name so it will not overwrite any existing data. 
    
    With this
    parameter turned off, attaching two pieces of data with the same
    name will cause the second one to replace the first. There are
    situations where each type of behavior is desirable. 
    
    If an object
    needs to have several [Fan Forces|Node:dop/fan] blowing on it, it is
    much easier to use the __Unique Data Name__ feature to ensure that
    each fan does not overwrite a previous fan rather than trying to
    change the __Data Name__ of each fan individually to avoid
    conflicts. 
    
    On the other hand, if an object is known to have [RBD
    State|Node:dop/rbdstate] data already attached to it, leaving this
    option turned off will allow some new [RBD State|Node:dop/rbdstate]
    data to overwrite the existing data.
