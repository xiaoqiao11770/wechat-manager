"""A microsolver that removes the divergent components of a velocity
field."""

The Gas Project Non Divergent DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that
allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to
extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may
attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Project Non Divergent DOP removes any divergent portions of a
velocity field. These are parts of the velocity field that represent
expansion or contraction. This is done by computing a pressure field
that counteracts any compression or rarefication and applying that
pressure field instantaneously.

NOTE:
    The [Curl Noise POP|Node:pop/curlnoise] is often used with this node in FLIP fluid simulations, because it plays very predictably with any fluid simulations that contain the Gas Project Non Divergent DOP.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to make divergence free. This must be a
        vector field.

	Two different algorithms are used depending on the type of the
	velocity field.  If the velocity field has Face Sampling, a
	PCG iteration is used to project.  If it has Center Sampling,
	a relaxation algoirthm is used to project.
    Surface Field:
        An SDF that specifies which voxels are to be considered in the
        divergence calculations. Voxels are either inside (less than 0)
        or outside. Incompressibility is only enforced on the interior
        voxels.
    Collision Field:
        Velocity values on collision boundaries are considered fixed.
    Goal Divergence Field:
        While the ostensible purpose of this micro solver is to remove
        divergence, one may want instead to make a field match a
        certain divergence pattern.  

	The goal divergence field is a
        scalar field which will be matched.  If not specified, a zero
        field is used, thereby having the equivalent of no-divergence.
        The field is scaled by the surface area of the voxels so can
        be specified independently of the resolution of the actual gas
        geometry.

        Note that the Gas Advection micro solver relies on the field
        being non-divergent - divergent fields may be inconsistent and
        not exhibit the proper rarefication/compression of scalar
        fields.  One can add in the rarefication/compression step by
        using a Gas Velocity Stretch micro solver on the density field
        using the modified velocity field as a reference.
    Pressure Field:
        The pressure required to make the velocity field divergence
        free is output into this field.
    Component Index:
        An index field which tracks which component number each voxel
        belongs to.  The fluid is broken into multiple connected
        components which can be identified with this field.
    Preserve Bubbles:
        Trapped air will be given a pressure value independent of the
        boundary pressure conditions. 

	This prevents the bubbles from
        collapsing in on themselves. If not set, fluid will be free to
        flow into bubbles from all sides ensuring their swift
        dissipation.
    Ghost Fluid:
        Pressures are extrapolated into air cells rather than just set
        to zero.  This causes sub-voxel ripples in the air side to be
        suppressed.
    Variational:
        Contribution to the pressure equation is proportional to the
        amount of the cell in the liquid.  This attempts to avoid
        stairstep boundaries on solid boundaries.
    Preconditioner:
        Controls which preconditioner is used for the conjugate
        gradient operation.  Should be left on Modified Incomplete
        Cholesky as it is the fastest to converge.
    Iterations:
	When the velocity field is center sampled, this specifies the
	number of iterations used to project it.  The number of
	iterations also controls the maximum distance any change in
	the velocity field can have, so should be about the width of
	the volume in voxels.  Lower iterations will be faster but the
	field will not be as nice.
