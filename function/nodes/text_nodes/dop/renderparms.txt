= Rendering Parameters =

The Rendering Parameters DOP provides some control over the display of
simulation object geometry in the viewport and when rendering. It also
allows a SHOP node to be specified for use with a simulation object when
rendering the DOP Network directly. This level of control is only
sufficient for performing test renders of a simulation. 

For full control
over the rendering of a DOP simulation it is recommended that the
simulation data be extracted to a Geometry Object using an [Object Merge SOP|Node:sop/object_merge]. From there all the standard rendering controls and options will be
available.

This data should be attached as subdata to Geometry data as each
Rendering Parameters data affects only a single piece of Geometry. As
such, it can be used to hide some geometry attached to an object while
exposing others. The Ground Plane DOP uses this technique to provide one
piece of geometry for display in the viewport, but a different piece of
geometry for use in collision detection.

The Rendering Parameters stores the choice as data values on the
simulation object.  As a result, any changes requires the simulation
to recook to update the changes.  If you want to toggle the rendering
parameters without recooking, use the Rendering Parameters Volatile DOP.

<!--
If you wish to insert this into a stream of objects, ensure the Data Name
is set to "Geometry/RenderParms". This is so you don't have to wire it
into a SOP Geometry DOP and instead can use it at a point later in the
network.

@parameters

Surface SHOP:
    #channels: /surfaceshop

    The SHOP Node to use when rendering the DOP Network directly,
    rather than through an Objet Merge SOP. 
    
    This SHOP value is not
    attached to the geometry directly so this setting is not
    preserved when extracting geometry from the simulation.
    
Display:
    #channels: /display

    The Geometry data to which this data is attached will be
    displayed in the viewport if this option is turned on. 
    
    If no
    Rendering Parameter data is attached to Geometry data, it will
    only be displayed in the viewport if it is attached to a
    simulation object with the name `Geometry`.
    
Render:
    #channels: /render

    The Geometry data to which this data is attached will be
    rendered if this option is turned on. 
    
    If no Rendering Parameter
    data is attached to Geometry data, it will only be rendered if
    it is attached to a simulation object with the name `Geometry`.
