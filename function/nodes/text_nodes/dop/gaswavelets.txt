"""A microsolver that performs a wavelet decomposition of a field."""

The Gas Wavelets DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Wavelets DOP performs a wavelet transform on a field. 

One pass of a 1D wavelet transform takes a waveform of N samples and
turns it into two waveforms of N/2 samples.  The first waveform
represents a coarser view of the original waveform.  The second
waveform stores the detail lost in the coarse representation.  This
process can then be repeated on the coarse samples to construct a
pyramid of detail waveforms.

One pass of a 3d wavelet transform is very similar.  A volume with
NxNxN voxels is turned into an average volume of N/2xN/2xN/2 samples
and seven detail volumes of N/2xN/2xN/2 samples.

Rather than output the resulting pyramid of volumes as separate
fields, they are all packed into the original field.

The Gas Wavelets DOP can take a packed field and perform the inverse
transform to turn it back into the original field. 

@parameters
    Dest Field:
	The field to store the result into.  Must be the same type
	(scalar, vector, matrix) as the source field.

    Source Field:
	The field to apply the wavelet operation to.  Can be any of
	scalar, vector, or matrix fields.

    Mode:
	The type of wavelet transform to perform.

	    Transform:
		The source field is the original field.  The
		destination field becomes a packed representation of
		the wavelet pyramid for this field.

	    Invert:
		The source field is a packed wavelet pyramid.  This is
		then transformed back into the same type as the
		original field.

	    Compute Power:
		The sum of squares of the detail coefficents on the
		given level of the packed wavelet pyramid is computed
		and stored into the destination field.  The
		destination field will be resized so a spatial
		sampling of the field will give an estimate of the
		energy in that octave of the power spectrum.

	    Extract Component:
		Extracts one of the wavelet vectors from the packed
		represenation and unpacks it into the destination
		field.  The destination field will be resized
		so a spatial sampling of the result should compare
		with the original volume.

    Wavelet:
	The type of wavelet transform to perform.  This controls how
	the waveform is split into average and detail components.

	    Haar:
		The average components are 1/sqrt(2) of the average of
		pairs of the source signals.  The detail are 1/sqrt(2)
		of the difference of the same pairs.  If the signal
		isn't a multiple of two, the missing detail vector is
		assumed to be zero.  The packed representation will
		have ceil(N/2) entries in the averages and floor(N/2)
		in the detail components with the zero detail
		component omitted.

    Limit Passes:
	Normally the entire wavelet pyramid is built by repeatedly
	applying the transform until reduced to a 1x1x1 volume.
	For a minor efficiency improvement you can limit the transform
	to those levels you are interestd in.  More importantly, the
	average detail vector of a given level is replaced by the next
	level's decomposition, so if one wants to extract this
	component one must limit the pyramid accordingly.

    Max Passes:
	How many wavelet passes to perform.  Only used in Transform
	and Invert modes.  To perform a proper inversion of a wavelet
	pyramid, the number of passes must match that which it was
	constructed with.

    Level:
	When Computing the Power or Extracting a Component, the level
	controls which level of the pyramid will be computed or
	extracted.  0 refers to the first level which has the resultof
	the first pass of the wavelet transform.

    Component:
	Which of the eight wavelet coefficients to extract in Extract
	Components mode.  0 corresponds to the average vectors which
	only will be valid of the transform was limited to the given
	level.  One through Seven correspond to the tensor products of
	the X, Y, and Z wavelet functions with the bit field of one to
	seven used to determine which products are used.  X is bit 0,
	Y bit 1, and Z bit 2.
