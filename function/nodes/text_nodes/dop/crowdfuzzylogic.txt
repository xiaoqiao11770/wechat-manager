"""Defines a Crowd Fuzzy Logic"""

Crowd Fuzzy Logic is a wrapper node for fuzzy network setup. It lets the user change crowd [state|/crowds/states] based on the fuzzy logic. The final crisp value that is defuzzed can be plugged into the threshold setup that will output boolean true/false which will trigger the [Crowd Transition|Node:dop/crowdtransition]. The node has the 'output' binding which will change based on whether the output should be a 'boolean' value (for crowd transitions) or a 'crisp' value (that will be used in other fuzzy setups). Node will automatically create 'bind' vops inside for the wired inputs.

@parameters
    Output:
        Specifies what output type to create.

        Boolean:
            Output attribute is a boolean True/False

            Boolean Threshold:
                Value to be compared aginst in the boolean test
            Test:
                Logic test to generate true/flase value
        Crisp:
            Output attribute is the result of the fuzzy setup
