= POP Attribute from Volume =

"""A POP node that copies volume values into a particle attribute."""

This node copies volume values into a particle attribute, which can be used to detect when a particle enters or leaves other objects in the scene.  

First use the [Volume tools|/shelf/volume] to create a fog volume for your external objects, and then use this node to create a float attribute marking if the particle is inside or not.  The resulting attribute can be then used in VEXpressions to modulate other POPs.

This operator modifies the attribute specified as a parameter.

    Volume Name:
	If this is specified, the __Volume Index__ isn't used to look up the source volume.  Instead, the source volume is matched using the `name` attribute on the source geometry.  If the name is `Cd`, and the source is a triple of volumes `Cd.x`, `Cd.y`, and `Cd.z`, they will be read as a single vector volume.

    Volume Index:
	Which primitive number to read from in the source geometry.

    == Attribute ==

	Merge Method:
	    How to combine the value from the volume with any existing value in the attribute.  You can thus preserve the attribute value by using __Maximum__, ensuring your value stores the largest volume value.

	Name:
	    The name of the attribute to create or edit.
	
	Type:
	    Whether to create a single float attribute or a vector attribute.  Vector attributes are 3 floats long.  If the source volume is a scalar volume, it will be triplicated to make the vector value.

	Input Range:
	    The range of expected volume values.  If you have a fog volume,
	    0 to 1 is good.  If you have a signed distance field, you may wish a
	    range like -0.1 to 0.1.

	Output Range:
	    The range of attribute values to output.  The lowest volume value in the input range will map to the lowest value in the output range.

	    NOTE:
		These ranges are not clamped.

	Adjustment Rate:
	    When __Merge Method__ is set to __Target__, this is the rate at which the attribute value changes to match the target value. `0.5` causes the attribute value to adjust halfway towards the target over `1/24th` of a second.
	    NOTE:
	        This is only available when type is __Vector__. For __Float__ type attributes, the rate is split into an __Increase Rate__ and __Decrease Rate__

	Increase Rate:
	    This rate is used instead of __Adjustment Rate__ when the __Type__ is __Float__ and the current attribute value is lower than the target value. `0.5` causes the attribute value to adjust halfway towards the target over `1/24th` of a second.

	Decrease Rate:
	    This rate is used instead of __Adjustment Rate__ when the __Type__ is __Float__ and the current attribute value is higher than the target value. `0.5` causes the attribute value to adjust halfway towards the target over `1/24th` of a second.
