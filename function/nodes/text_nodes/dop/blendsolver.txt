= Blend Solver =

The Blend Solver DOP allows simulation objects to be solved by applying
multiple different solvers and blending the results together. To use
this solver, other Solver nodes must be attached as sub-solvers to the
Blend Solver. Also, each simulation object using the Blend Solver must
have [Blend Factor|Node:dop/blendfactor] data attached to it to describe the contribution of each sub-solver.


@parameters
    Blend Data Name:
        #channels: /blenddataname

        The Blend Solver blends the results of only a single piece of
        data on the simulation objects. Common values for this parameter
        would be Position (to blend between an RBD solver and keyframed
        data, for example) or Geometry (to blend between a cloth solver
        and a SOP solver, for example).
    Blend Factors Root:
        #channels: /blendfactorsroot

        The Blend Factor data used by the Blend Solver can be attached
        anywhere on the simulation object. This parameter tells the
        solver where to look for the Blend Factor data. 
        
        The primary reason for changing this value is if your object has multiple
        Blend Solvers attached to it (one to blend Position data and
        another to blend Geometry data, for example). In that case each
        Blend Solver would want to look for its [Blend Factor|Node:dop/blendfactor] values in a unique location.
    Primary Solver:
        #channels: /primarysolver

        Specifies which sub-solver to use when other solvers make
        queries about the objects to which this solver is applied. This
        includes information such as what collision method to use, the
        mass of the object, or physical properties like friction. 
        
        This value should be set to point to the sub-solver that best
        represents how other objects in the scene should react to these
        objects.
        
    Match Solver Parms By Name:
        This parameter describes how the Blend Solver matches a
        particular [Blend Factor|Node:dop/blendfactor] value to a particular sub-solver. 
        
        If this option is on, then for each sub-solver the Blend Solver
        looks for a Blend Factor data with the same name as the
        sub-solver. If this option is turned off, the sub-solvers and
        Blend Factors are simply matched up in order with the first
        sub-solver using the first Blend Factor value, and so on.
