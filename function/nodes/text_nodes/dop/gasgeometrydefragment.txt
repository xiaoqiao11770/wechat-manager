"""A microsolver that defragments geometry."""

This node defragments the incoming geometry.  This collapses points, 
primitives, and vertices to provide faster access by removing any holes.
This is most useful is succeeding operations will be using `point` style
VEX functions to index random points.

@parameters

Geometry:
    The geometry subdata to defragment. Can consist of
    multiple space separated geometries.
