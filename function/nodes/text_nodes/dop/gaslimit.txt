"""A microsolver that clamps a field within certain values."""

The Gas Limit DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Limit DOP clamps the specified fields within certain bounds.  Out of
bound voxels can either be set to the limit, or set to a specific revert value.


@parameters
Destination Field:
    The list of fields to clamp.  These can be scalar, vector, or matrix
    fields.

Minimum Choice:
    How to set the minimum value.  If this is set to__None__, or __Field__ and no field is specified, no clamping against a minimum will be performed.  Constant will cause it to clamp against the minimum value.

Minimum Field:
    If minimum choice is __Field__, this field specifies the minimum value for each voxel.  It does not have to be the same scalar/vector/matrix as the destination field.  If it doesn't exist, no minimum clamping is done.

Minimum Value:
    The minimum value to clamp against if the choice is set to __Constant__.

Minimum Choice:
    How to set the maximum value.  If this is set to__None__, or __Field__ and no field is specified, no clamping against a maximum will be performed.  Constant will cause it to clamp against the maximum value.

Maximum Field:
    If maximum choice is __Field__, this field specifies the maximum value for each voxel.  It does not have to be the same scalar/vector/matrix as the destination field.  If it doesn't exist, no maximum clamping is done.

Maximum Value:
    The maximum value to clamp against if the choice is set to Constant.

Revert Choice:
    How to set the reversion value.  If this is set to__None__, or __Field__ and no field is specified, no clamping against a minimum will be performed.  Constant will cause it to clamp against the minimum value.

    The reversion value is used when a voxel is out of the bounds specified by
    the limit.  If no reversion value is specified, the voxel's value will be
    clamped.  Otherwise, it will be set to the reversion value.

Revert Field:
    If revert choice is __Field__, this field specifies the revert value for each voxel.  It does not have to be the same scalar/vector/matrix as the destination field.  If it doesn't exist, no revert clamping is done.

Revert Value:
    The revert value to clamp against if the choice is set to Constant.

Blend:
    Specifies the width of a smooth blend between the non-limited and limited values as the original value approaches the limit.  If only a minimum or maximum if specified, this value specifies the distance away from the limit in which the smooth blending applies.  If both a minimum and maximum are specified, this values specifies the portion of the `max`-`min` interval in which the smooth blending applies.
