= Motion =

""" Defines an object's position, orientation, linear velocity, and
angular velocity. """

The Motion DOP creates simulation data representing motion. Motion
information is a superset of the position information created by the
Position DOP. Motion information consists of the position information
plus linear and angular velocity values.


@parameters
    Position:
        Position of the object in world space.
    Pivot:
        The pivot point for the rotation. This is defined in the
        object's own space.
    Rotation:
        Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ format.
    Velocity:
        Velocity of the object in world space.
    Angular Velocity:
        Angular velocity of the object. This is the axis of rotation
        times the rate of rotation. 

	Speed of rotation is measured in
        degrees per second, so a multiplier of 360 will cause the object
        to rotate once per second. The triple (0, 360, 0) will cause the
        object to rotate once about the y axis every second.
