= Anchor: Object Point Group Rotation =

"""Defines orientations based on multiple points on the given geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Group Rotation belongs to a class of DOP nodes 
that define position or orientation values for use in building constraints.

This anchor defines orientations based on multiple points on the given 
geometry of a simulation object. The points are specified by number or
by group.


@parameters
    Object:
	#channels: /object

	Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used to 
	find the group of points.
    Geometry:
	#channels: /geometry
	
	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the group of points.
    Point Group:
	#channels:  /pointgroup

	Specifies the selection of points that define the orientations of 
	this anchor.
    Orient Attribute:
	#channels: /orientattribname
    
	Specifies the name of the quaternion attribute on the geometry
	that is used as the point orientation.  If this value is left
	blank, or specifies an attribute that does not exist on the
	geometry, the __Up__ and __Out__ Attributes are used instead.
    Up Attribute:
	#channels: /upattribname
	
	Specifies the name of the up vector attribute used to calculate
	the orientation of the point if the orient attribute is not
	specified.
    Out Attribute:
	#channels: /outattributename

	Specifies the name of the out (normal) vector attribute used to
	calculate the orientation of the point if the orient attribute
	is not specified.
    Rotation:
	#channels: /rx /ry /rz

	This parameter specifies an offset to the orientation pulled from
	the point attributes.
    Rotation Attribute Name:
	#channels: /rotationattribname

	Overrides the __Rotation__ of each point by applying the value of the
	given attribute on a per-point basis.
    Constraint Type:
	#channels: /condof
    
	Free to Rotate in Any Direction:
	    
	    The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
	    in any way.
	Rotation Axis Lies on Plane (Specify Normal):

	    The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
	    in two dimensions.  It may rotate any amount around any axis of
	    rotation that lies in a plane.

	    The normal of the plane is defined by the __Constraint Direction__
	    parameter.
	Rotation Around Axis (Specify Axis):
	
	    The object is allowed to deviate from the requested orientation
	    by rotating around an axis.

	    The axis is specified in the __Constraint Direction__ parameter.
	Rotation Fixed:
	    
	    The object is fully constrained to the orientation specified
	    by this anchor.
    Constraint Type Attribute Name:
	#channels: /condofattribname

	Overrides the __Constraint Type__ of each point by applying the value
	of the given attribute on a per-point basis.
    Constraint Direction:
	#channels: /condir

	Depending on the __Constraint Type__ parameter, this parameter
	defines either the permitted axis of rotation for the object,
	or the normal to the plane that defines the allowed axes of rotation
	for the object.  If the __Constraint Type__ is __Free to Rotate in
	Any Direction__ or __Rotation Fixed__, then this parameter has no 
	effect.
    Constraint Direction Attribute Name:
	#channels: /condirattribname

	Overrides the __Constraint Direction__ of each point by applying 
	the value of the given attribute on a per-point basis.
