Compute Mass:
    Determines if the mass will be calculated automatically from the
    object's density and volume.
Density:
    #channels: /density

    The mass of a wire object is its volume times its density. The
    volume is affected by the width parameter.
Mass:
    #channels: /mass

    The absolute mass of the object.
Width:
    #channels: /width

    The width of the wire object defines the diameter of each
    cylindrical section.
Friction:
    #channels: /friction

    The coefficient of friction of the object. A value of 0 means the
    object is frictionless. This governs how much the tangential
    velocity is affected by collisions.
Dynamic Friction Scale:
    #channels: /dynamicfriction

    An object sliding may have a lower friction coefficient than an
    object at rest. This is the scale factor that relates the two. It is
    not a friction coefficient, but a scale between zero and one. 
    
    A value of one means that dynamic friction is equal to static
    friction. A scale of zero means that as soon as static friction is
    overcome the object acts without friction.
