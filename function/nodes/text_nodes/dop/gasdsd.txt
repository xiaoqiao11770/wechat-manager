"""A microsolver that applies one round detontation shock dyanamics."""

The Gas DSD DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas DSD DOP evolves fields according to detonation shock dynamics.
This updates both a detonation speed and detonation speed derivative
scalar field using provided curvature and advected curvature fields.
For an idea of how to set this up, look at the Gas DSD Solver node.

@parameters
    D Field:
	The __Scalar__ field which holds the detonation speed of each
	voxel.  This is updated with a new detonation speed.
    D' Field:
	A __Scalar__ field storing the time derivative of the
	detonation speed.  This stores how much the detonation speed
	will change in one second and gives a sort of momentum to the
	dynamics.
    Curvature Field:
	The curvature of the flamefront which is used by the curvature
	forcing term to affect the detonation speed.
    Advected Curvature Field:
	To determine the time derivative of the curvature field, the
	previous curvature field is advected by the velocity field and
	provided here.
    Elasticity:
	How strongly the D field will return to the rest detonation speed.
    Elastic Damping:
	Dampings the elastic force reducing oscillations around the
	rest detonation speed.
    Curvature Forcing:
	A scalar factor for how much effect the curvature field has on
	the detonation speed field.
    Curvature Damping:
	Dampens the effect of curvature forcing to reduce
	oscillations.
    C5, Mu Theta: 
	Parameters controlling the scale of the dynamics.
    Detonation Speed:
	The rest detonation speed that the D field will be driven to.
