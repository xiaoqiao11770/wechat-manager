"""A microsolver that snaps a surface onto a collision surface."""

The Gas Surface Snap DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Surface Snap DOP adjusts an SDF surface to lie exactly on a
collision boundary.  It does this by adjusting the surface values to
match those of the collision wherever both are within a certain range
of the surface and the normals of the surfaces are within a certain
tolerance.  This is useful for removing air bubbles that might be
created in a surface/collision boundary.  

NOTE:
	Using this as part of the simulation (rather than as a post-process) can lead to volume gain as the fluid is prevented from separating from the collision geometry.

@parameters
    Surface Field:
        A signed distance field representing the surface. The zero
        isocontour of this surface is used to determine where the
        surface is for snapping.
    Collision Field:
        Signed distance field that represents the collision geometry.
    Snap Distance:
        Measured in voxel cells of the surface field, snapping will
        occur where both the collision field and the surface field are
        within this distance.
    Snap Angle:
        The normals of the surface and collision field will be
        inspected and snapping only performed if they are pointing
        within this tolerance.
