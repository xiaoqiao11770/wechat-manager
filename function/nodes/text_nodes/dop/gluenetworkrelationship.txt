= Glue Network Relationship =

"""Defines a glue relationship based on geometry."""

The glue network relationship is a low level tool to define 
glue relationships based on geometry.

The Glue Network Constraint DOP should likely be used instead of building
from this node.

Geometry subdata attached to this node will specify the constraint
network.  Like all relationships, a Solver named subdata can be
added to run a per frame solver on the relationship.

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Name Attribute:
    A point attribute giving the name that each point represents.  More than
    one point can refer to the same object.  If this is a string attribute, it
    is a dopname.  If it is an integer attribute, it is a DOP id.

Strength:
    Specifies the bond strength of the glue connections.  A value of -1 means
    the connections will never break.

Strength Attribute:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond strength.  If present, the
    attribute value will be multiplied with the __Strength__ parameter.
    However, if the attribute value is -1, the bond will be unbreakable
    regardless of the __Strength__ parameter.  If the __Strength__ 
    parameter is -1, then the primitive attribute will replace the
    parameter.

Half-Life:
    The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one half. Whenever a
    glued object gets hit, it accumulates a glue impulse force. This controls
    how fast that force decays.

Half-Life Attribute:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond glue impulse rate of decay.
    If present, the attribute value will be multiplied with the __Half-Life__
    parameter.

Impact Propagations:
    When one of the objects is hit, its impact value is spread along the glue
    network.  This allows distant glue bonds that are weak to be broken prior
    to nearer, strong bonds.  The impact propagations is the number of rounds
    of propagation to do. Impulses will not travel more than this number of
    bonds each solve step.

Propagate Rate:
    Specifies how much the impacts propagate along each bond.

Propagate Rate Attribute:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond impact propagation rate.
    If present, the attribute value will be multiplied with the __Propagate Rate__
    parameter.
