= Pump Relationship =

The Pump Relationship DOP is used by the Smoke and Fluid solvers to have
another simulation object act as a smoke or fluid pump for the smoke or
fluid object.

Fluid and smoke that lies within the pump has its velocity set
directly to the pumps velocity.  A [Motion DOP|Node:dop/motion] can be used to specify the local motion of the pump.

NOTE:
    SOP geometry must be a SDF volume with velocity to work as a pump object. The exception is if the geometry is a particle system, since DOPs builds a small 3d volume around each point.
