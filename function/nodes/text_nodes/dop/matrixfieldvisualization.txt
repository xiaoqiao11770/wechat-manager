= Matrix Field Visualization =

"""Visualizes a matrix field."""

The Matrix Field Visualization DOP visualizes a Matrix Field data.
The resulting visualization can allow one to determine how a field is
behaving over time, or can even be Object Merged into SOPs to produce
the final output.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry should be visualized at all.
    Bounding Box:
        Draws a bounding box encompassing the field.
    Bounding Box Hash:
        Adds hash marks along the axes leaving the origin of the
        bounding box marking the divisions between each voxel.  

	The hash marks are drawn larger for every tenth and every
        hundredth.
    Color:
        The color to use in visualization.  The iso surface or smoke
        field will be colored with this color.
    Iso Offset:
        If not using Smoke or Plane visualization, an iso surface will
        be built at this value.  

	The values for the iso surface will be the euclidean norm of the matrix values.
    Invert Iso:
	    Reverse the primitive directions of the iso.
    Use Smoke:
        Visualize by creating a volume primitive for each component of
        the 3x3 matrix described by the field.
    Use Plane:
        Visualize by cutting a plane through the scalar field and
        coloring the points on the plane according to the euclidean
        norm of the matrix field.
    Plane Orientation:
        The orientation of the cutting plane for visualization.
    Plane Position:
        Where in space the center of the plane is.  It is always set
        to encompass the matrix field's bounds, so the only relevant
        axis is the one the plane's normal matches.
    Visualization Mode:
        How to convert the range of the matrix field's norms into colors.

        Infra-Red:
            False color is used with blue being 0 and red being 1.
        White to Red:
            White is used for 0 and red is used for 1.
        Grayscale:
            Black is used for 0 and white is used for 1.
        Black Body:
            A black (0) to red to yellow to white (1) ramp is used.
    Guide Range:
        Before applying the visualization coloring, the given range is
        compressed into the 0..1 range used by the coloring schemes.
        
	Setting this to 3..7 will cause values of 3 to be colored as
        if they were 0 and values of 7 to be colored as if they were
        1.
