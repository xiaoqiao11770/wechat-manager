"""A POP node that sets the spin of particles.."""

The POP Spin node directly sets the spin, or angular velocity, of particles.

NOTE:
        The attribute to store angular velocity, `w`, is measured in radians per second, which differs from the degrees per second used in this interface.  To convert between the two, the `radians()` and `degrees()` VEX functions can be used.  For convenience, the local variable `oldspinspeed` is defined which stores the particle's previous angular velocity measured in degrees per second.

This operator modifies the `w` attribute.  It ensures the `orient` attribute
exists.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==
	Axis Relative to Particle's Orientation:
	    The provided goal axis will be rotated into the particle's own reference frame.  Thus a value of (0, 1, 0) will be up in the space of the particle rather than in world space.
	Axis:
	    The axis for the particle to spin around.
	Spin Speed:
	    How fast, in degrees per second, that the particle should spin
	    around the given axis.
	    If this is zero, it will set the spin to a stop.
