"""A microsolver that determines the collision field between the fluid
field and any affector objects."""

The Gas Build Collision Mask DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that
allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to
extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may
attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Build Collision Mask DOP builds a collision field that
represents where affector objects overlap with the fluid field. It
generates a signed distance field which is negative inside colliding
objects and positive outside. It also generates a collision velocity
field that stores the velocity of the affector object closest to each
point.


@parameters
    Collision Field:
        A scalar field of this name is created and set to be a signed
        distance field of the affector objects. 

        Each voxel of this field
        is the distance to the closest affector object. If it is inside
        an affector object, it is the negative distance to the surface.
    Collision Velocity Field:
        A vector field which is set to the velocity of the closest
        affector object to each point. This is the local velocity - a
        rotating ball but stationary will have a tube shaped velocity
        field.

	If a field name is specified, this field will be created if
	it does not exist.
    Index Field:
        An optional index field which is set to the object id of which
        object was closest to the given voxel and within the bandwidth
        distance.

	If a field name is specified, this field will be created if
	it does not exist.
    Reference Field:
        If specified, both the generated __Collision Field__, __Collision Velocity__, and __Index Field__ field will be resized and re-resolutioned to match the reference field.
    Use Bandwidth:
        Rather than initializing the entire SDF with the distance to
        the relationship objects, only initialize up to a distance
        specified by the bandwidth.
    Bandwidth:
        The distance to the relationship objects to build the SDF,
        measured in voxel cells.
    Particle Bandwidth:
	When the source is a particle system, add this number of
	voxels to the particle's pscale radius to ensure each particle
	influences at least one voxel cell.
    Use Point Velocity for Collisions:
        The local velocity of an affector object is a combination of
        the angular and linear velocity. However, if the object is
        deforming and points match frame to frame, the local point
        velocity can be used as well to estimate the deformation effect.
    Use Volume Velocity for Collisions:
        If an affector object doesn't have a stable point count, but
        does have a volume representation, the change in the volume
        representation can be used as an estimate of deformation
        velocity. 

        NOTE:
            This does not include any velocity tangential to the volume surface - a conveyor belt will appear to be stationary as the volume remains unchanged frame to frame.

    Collide with Non-SDF:
	Turning this on enables collision with non-SDF objects, such as smoke
	or liquids.

	Normally, the relationship uses the Signed Distance Field for
	each object.  However, if the object is a different type
	you can use other ways of getting its effective signed
	distance field.  If this is set, the object is examined for a
	"surface" scalarfield, which is treated as a signed distance
	field.  If a "density" field is present, it is treated as a
	fog volume with a 0.5 cutoff.  If a "geometry" geometry is
	attached, and the geometry consists of a single volume, that
	volume will be treated as a Fog volume (with cut off of 0.5). However, if its boundary condition is set to SDF, it will be treated as an SDF.
