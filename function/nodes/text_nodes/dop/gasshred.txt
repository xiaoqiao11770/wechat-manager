"""Applies a Shredding Force to the velocity field specified."""

Creates and applies a shred force. The shred force rips apart a velocity field (default is velocity) based on the gradient of a field (default is temperature) and can greatly improve the look of fire.
Shredding also introduces streaks if applied properly. This shred field is modulated by the __Control Field__ and lookup ramps provided.   
This controls where and with what magnitude the shred force shows up, so you can
ensure it occurs only in the regions of the sim you want.

TIP:
    Since shredding works on the gradient of the field specified as temperature, less diffusion of that field (by default temperature) results in a stronger, more noticeable effect. When temperature diffuses more, the gradient becomes less dynamic. Resulting in bigger streaks. The higher the grid resolution, the more detailed the gradient becomes.

@parameters

Visualize Shredding:
    Visualizes the shred vector field that will be applied to the specified velocity field.
    
Modify Temperature Through Shredding:
    Shifts the temperature values (of the field defined as temperature) before calculating the gradient. Because the operation repeats itself every timestep, a shift in force can be enforced making the result more dynamic.
    
Time Scale:
    Specifies a scale factor that relates DOP time to the simulation time for this microsolver. A value greater than one means the simulation time advances faster than the DOP time. A value less than one causes the simulation to appear to run in slow motion relative to the DOP time. Several expression functions such as doptime exist for converting from global times to simulation times and vice versa.
    
Scale:
    Amount of shred force applied to specified velocity field.
    
Temperature Threshold:
    Defines the point where the velocity will be squashed or stretched. Based on the field defined as temperature. Values lower then the Threshold will be stretched, values higher then the threshold will get squashed. The right value depends on the amount of temperature to be found in the simulation. The lighter the simulation, the lower the value should be.
    
Threshold Width:
    Defines the width of the blend area where values get squashed or stretched. Creating a neutral zone around the Threshold value. A value of 0 results in a harsh squash, stretch effect. Higher values result in smoother streaks.
    
Squash:
    How much to squash the velocity field based on the calculated gradient, for values sampled higher then the __Temperature Threshold__ value.
    
Stretch:
    How much to stretch the velocity field based on the calculated gradient, for values sampled lower then the __Temperature Threshold__ value.
    
Clip Gradient:
    Controls the maximum slope allowed from the calculated gradient. When a lot of temperature is present the gradient's magnitude will turn out too strong.
    
    By setting a limit, the influence will be capped at the value set. This ensures that a more balanced shred effect can be achieved.
    The correct value should correspond to the maximum shred value found in the area where you want the shredding to have the most influence,
    most often this is not a the core but somewhere higher up. Since the core is probably the hottest part in your simulation, the influence there will be capped to the value given.
    
Temp Influence Rate:
    If __Modify Temperature Through Shredding__ is enabled, this values controls how fast the field defined as temperature is allowed to shift places before the gradient is calculated (on which to base shedding).
                

== Control Settings ==

Specifies where shredding has any influence and to what degree. 

Control Field:
    When enabled, the force is scaled by the field specified.
    
Control Influence:
    How much influence the __Control Field__ has on the previously calculated force. A value of 0 disables the control field.
    
Control Min Max:
    Remaps (normalizes) the incoming __Control Field__ values based on the specified minimum and maximum. The output is always in a range of 0 to 1.
    
Remap Control Field:
    Use the __Control Field Ramp__ to remap the control field's (normalized) values.
        
== Visualization ==

For all visualization options, refer to the [Scalar Field Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] and [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] node help.
    
== Bindings and Temporary Fields ==

Clear Temporary Fields:
    Zeros the temporary fields when done to reduce memory usage.
    
Shred Temperature Gradient Field:
    The name of the temporary fields to store intermediate steps needed. These will be created with a [Gas Match Field|Node:dop/gasmatchfield] so it does not need to exist ahead of time.
    
Velocity Field:
    Used for sampling information from, and apply shred force to.
    
Temperature Field:
    Field used as a base for the gradient. The gradient is used to drive the shred force.
