"""A microsolver that calculates particle fluid attribute values for
each particle in a particle fluid field."""

The Gas Compute Particle Attributes DOP is a microsolver used to build
larger fluid simulations.  It is currently used to compute particle
attributes in the [Particle Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver].


@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which attributes
        are to be computed.
    Compute Density Gradient:
        Enable this option to compute and store the gradient of the
        fluid density field at each particle location.
    Compute Neighbor Velocity:
        Enable this option to compute and store the neighbor velocity
        attribute at each particle location.  This attribute stores
        the average velocity of all neighbors of a particle.
