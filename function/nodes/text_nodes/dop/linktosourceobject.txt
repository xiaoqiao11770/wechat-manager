= Link to Source Object =

""" Stores the name of the scene level object source for this DOP object. """

The Link to Source Object DOP creates a piece of data called SourceObject
on a DOP object. This data contains the name of a scene level Object or
SOP node that served as the source for the DOP object's geometry. 

This data is only used by shelf tool scripts and some Houdini internals to
provide an easy way to jump from a DOP object to the scene level object
that spawned the DOP object. If this data is missing or invalid, the only
consequence will be that some shelf tools may not work properly on this
DOP object.
