"""A microsolver that converts a particle system into a signed distance
field."""

The Gas Particle to SDF dynamics node is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Particle to SDF DOP constructs a signed distance field from a
particle system. The particle's `pscale` attribute is used to describe
spheres of a given radius - points inside those spheres is considered
inside, and outside outside.


@parameters
Surface Field:
        The scalar field that will be initialized as a signed distance field.

Surface Index:
        An index field that will store the point number of the point used to calculate the surface distance for each voxel when in Closest Point or Closest Point Uniform Radius mode.

Particles:
        The geometry which specifies the particles. The `pscale` attribute is used to specify a sphere for each particle.

Particle Group:
        An optional point group to specify which points will be considered.

Bandwidth:
        The distance, measured in voxel cells, to initialize the surface field away from the particle surfaces. 

        Voxels farther than this from any particles will be initialized with the bandwidth value.

Use Max Speed:
        Use the maximum speed of the particles to expand the bandwidth to which the surface field will be initialized.  This can be useful to increase the extrapolation when a fluid is moving quickly.  The particles must have a `v` attribute specifying their velocity.

Max Speed Scale:
        A scale applied to the maximum speed before using it to expand the bandwidth.

Scale Multiplier:
        A scale applied to the particle radii before any lookups are performed.

Method:
        Average Position:
                Each voxel is set to a weighted average distance of all particles whose radius overlaps the sample position.
        Closest Particle:
                Each voxel is set to the distance to the closest particles whose radius overlaps the sample position.
        Closest Particle Uniform Radius:
                Each voxel is set to the distance to the closest particles whose radius overlaps the sample position. In this case all particles are assumed to have the same uniform radius as the first particle, and internally a faster algorithm can be used for spatial lookup that scales well to millions of input points.
                
Rebuild SDF:
        The default output of this node is the closest distance at each voxel to each input point. Enabling this option will cause the solver to rebuild this field into a valid Signed Distance Function. Only valid when Method is set to Closest Particle Uniform Radius.
