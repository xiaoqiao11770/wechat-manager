= ODE Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for ODE Objects to an object."""

The ODE Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches the
data which is needed for it to be used by a [ODE Solver|Node:dop/odesolver]

This DOP is very similar to the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject], except it allows you to
explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as
the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or
creating objects every 10 frames.


@parameters

[Include:standard_ode_parms]

Only Autofit if ODE Solver Present:
    Autofitting can be expensive as it requires cooking the input geometry and
    evaluating its bounds.  When set, the autofitting will automatically
    disable if no ode solver is found in the output chain.

Composite Object:
    Points to the SOP that you want to use as your Composite object.
    
Input Geometry Type:
    Lets you choose whether your input geometry is a Specified Object or Instanced Points.

Input Geometry:
    The path of the input geometry.

Use Deforming Geometry:
    Causes the geometry for the object to be pulled from the chosen
    SOP at each timestep. If the SOP contains animated geometry, the
    RBD object's geometry will also animate.

Transform Guide Geometry:
    If this checkbox is turned on, the Input Geometry's object transform is applied.

Guide Color:
    The color that is displayed when you check __Display ODE Primitive__.

@inputs
    First:
        The simulation objects to turn into ODE objects by attaching
        the appropriate data.
@outputs
    First:
        The simulation objects which were passed into this node are
        output with the data required for them to be considered ODE
        Objects attached.
@locals
    [Include:standard_locals]
