Use Time Step:
    Determines if the current solver timestep will be used to apply
    this node.  
    
    If set, the current timestep size will be multiplied
    by the scale and used for the time increment for this operation.
    Otherwise, the time scale will specify an absolute fictitious time
    to integrate by.

    By disabling the link between the actual real time and the
    microsolver time, you can perform operations in a separate,
    fictitious, time.
Time Scale:
    The timestep used for this microsolver will be scaled by this
    amount.  This allows one to achieve non-realistic effects, such as
    parts of the simulation operating at different speeds than other
    parts.  
    
    Similarly, it is useful if a solver needs to be evaluated
    independently of the main timestep.
