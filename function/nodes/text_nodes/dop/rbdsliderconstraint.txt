"""Constrains an object to rotate and translate on a single axis, and limits the rotation and translation on that axis."""

This involves constraining some location on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to a goal location derived from another simulation object or from a position in world space.

Parameters describing how the constraint is applied are broken up into
two sets, found under the __Hinge__ and __Orthogonal__ tabs of the
__Slider__ pane. Parameters under the __Hinge__ tab affect how the
constraint is applied when the current rotation or translation on the
hinge axis have exceeded their defined limits. Parameters under the
__Orthogonal__ tab affect how the constraint is applied when rotation
or translation has occurred on axes other than the hinge axis.

RBD Slider Constraint is a digital asset.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] used to determine the goal
            position. If this parameter is left blank, the objects will be constrained to a world space position.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint in the goal
            object.

    == Slider ==

        Max Rotation:
            The maximum rotation about the hinge axis in degrees.
        Slide Range:
            The range in which the constrained object may slide.
        Axes:
            Goal Hinge Axis:
                #channels: /goal_hinge_axisx /goal_hinge_axisy /goal_hinge_axisz

                The goal direction the constraint may slide or rotate
                on. Defaults to the X axis.
            Goal Up Axis:
                #channels: /goal_up_axisx /goal_up_axisy /goal_up_axisz

                The goal direction of the up axis. Defaults to the Y axis.
                This should be perpendicular to the hinge axis. The out axis
                is calculated as the cross product of the hinge and up axes.
            Goal Rotation Offset:
                #channels: /goal_rot_offset

                This parameter rotates the __Goal Up Axis__ around the __Goal Hinge
                Axis__. Specified in degrees.
            Constrained Hinge Axis:
                #channels: /constrained_hinge_axisx /constrained_hinge_axisy /constrained_hinge_axisz

                The initial hinge axis of the constrained object.
            Constrained Up Axis:
                #channels: /constrained_up_axisx /constrained_up_axisy /constrained_up_axisz

                The initial up axis of the constrained object. This should be
                perpendicular to the constrained hinge axis.
            Constrained Rotation Offset:
                #channels: /constrained_rot_offset

                This parameter rotates the __Constrained Up Axis__ around the __Constrained Hinge
                Axis__. Specified in degrees.
        Hinge:
            Position Softness:
                #channels: /hinge_position_softness

                Increase this to soften the bounds on position along the hinge
                axis. This specifies the rate at which the constraint corrects
                positional errors along the hinge axis.
            Position Damping:
                #channels: /hinge_position_damping

                Increase this to cause the constrained object to bounce once
                it has slid to the end of its range.  When the constrained
                object reaches a positional limit along the hinge axis, a
                higher damping value increases the velocity in the direction
                opposite the current direction along the hinge axis.
            Position Cfm:
                #channels: /hinge_position_cfm

                Increase this to loosen the bounds on position along the hinge
                axis, and potentially increase the stability of the
                simulation. The positional constraint along the hinge axis may
                be violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
                re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
            Angle Softness:
                #channels: /hinge_angle_softness

                Increase this to soften the bounds on rotation about the hinge
                axis. This specifies the rate at which the constraint corrects
                rotational errors around the hinge axis.
            Angle Damping:
                #channels: /hinge_angle_damping

                Increase this to cause the constrained object to bounce once
                it has rotated to the end of its range.         When the constrained
                object reaches an angular limit around the hinge axis, a
                higher damping value increases the angular velocity in the
                direction opposite the current direction around the hinge
                axis.
            Angle Cfm:
                #channels: /hinge_angle_cfm

                Increase this to loosen the bounds on rotation about the hinge
                axis, and potentially increase the stability of the
                simulation. The angular constraint about the hinge axis may be
                violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
                re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
        Ortho:
            Position Softness:
                #channels: /ortho_position_softness

                Increase this to the soften the alignment of the position of
                the goal and constrained hinge axes. This specifies the rate
                at which the constraint corrects positional errors around axes
                other than the hinge axis.
            Position Cfm:
                #channels: /ortho_position_cfm

                Increase this to loosen the alignment of the position of the
                goal and constrained hinge axes, and potentially increase the
                stability of the simulation. The positional constraint along
                axes other than the hinge axis may be violated by an amount
                proportional to the force required to re-establish the
                constraint, times this parameter.
            Angle Softness:
                #channels: /ortho_angle_softness

                Increase this to soften the alignment of the rotation of the
                goal and constrained hinge axes. This specifies the rate at
                which the constraint corrects rotational errors around axes
                other than the hinge axis.
            Angle Cfm:
                #channels: /ortho_angle_cfm

                Increase this to loosen the alignment of the rotation of the goal
                and constrained hinge axes, and potentially increase the
                stability of the simulation. The angular constraint along axes
                other than the hinge axis may be violated by an amount
                proportional to the force required to re-establish the
                constraint, times this parameter.
