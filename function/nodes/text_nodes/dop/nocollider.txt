= No Collider =

The No Collider DOP creates a Collider which doesn't actually perform
any collision detection. By using this node in conjunction with the
Collider Label node, it is possible to specify groups of objects which
will not collide with each other.

Suppose objects A and B are both RBD objects and are mutual affectors.
These two objects are among many other objects, all of which should
collide with each other. But for some reason, objects A and B should not
collide with each other. The scene requires them to pass right through
each other. All of the objects except A and B will have a Collider Label
of "Volume". Object B will be given the special Collider Label of
"ObjectB", and object A will be "ObjectA". Object A would then have a No
Collider node connected to its Collider Label node with the data name
"ObjectB", and object B would have a No Collider node with a data name
of "ObjectA" as subdata on its Collider Label. Finally, to ensure that
objects A and B collide with all the other objects, the other objects
would all have two Volume/Volume Collider nodes attached to their
Collider Label subdata with data names "ObjectA" and "ObjectB". Notice
this example extends easily to groups of objects which could be assigned
Collider Labels of "GroupA" and "GroupB".
