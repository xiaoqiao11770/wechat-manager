"""A microsolver that keeps particles within a box."""

This node clamps the points of a geometry object to lie within a given box.
Out-of-bound points can also have their velocities adjusted to ensure they do
not just immediately leave the bound again.

The Gas Limit Particles DOP is a microsolver for use in larger fluid
simulations. You can use this with the [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and
[Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] nodes which allow microsolvers to be added
before or after the main solver step to extend or tweak the simulation.
Alternatively, expert users could use this and other microsolvers to build an
entirely new solver.

@parameters

Geometry:
    The geometry subdata whose points will be changed. Can consist of
    multiple space separated geometries.
Point Group:
    An optional point group to specify which points will be limited.

Pos Attribute:
    The point attribute to use for the point's position.  Must have at least
    three floats.

Pos Behavior:
    How to treat out-of-bound points.  

    Clamp:
        Set the point position to lie on the boundary.
        
    Bounce:
        Reflect the point position around the boundary.  If a point escapes
        by 0.5 units, place it 0.5 units on the inside of the boundary.
        This conserves the motion of the escaping particle and avoids
        having all the particles gaining the same location.
    Wrap:
        A point leaving the right boundary by a distance of 0.1 will be
        moved to 0.1 to the right of the left boundary.

Kill Outside Open Boundaries:
    Delete any particles outside an open boundary.

Vel Attribute:
    The point attribute to use for velocity operations. The velocity will 
    only be affected if it is in the direction of the boundary. On escaping
    the +X boundary, the velocity will only change if it is positive in the X
    direction, not if it is negative. This is to allow the particles to freely
    separate from the boundaries.

Vel Behavior:
    How to correct the velocities when they are pointing the wrong way and a
    point has escaped.

    None:
        Perform no velocity correction.
        
    Clamp:
        Set the component of the velocity to zero if it lies in the
        collision direction.
        
    Bounce:
        Negate the component of the velocity if it lies in the collision direction.

Use Bounce Settings:
    Use the __Bounce__ and __Bounce Forward__ physical parameters if present
    on this object.   If there is a `bounce` or `bounceforward` point
    attribute on the geometry, use it to override the physical parameters.

    If neither is present, or this option is disabled, use 1.0 for
    both bounce and bounce forward where applicable.

Reference:
    If you enter the path to a volume data here, the node will use
    its center and size instead of the __Center__ and __Size__
    parameters. If you enter the path to geometry data, the node will
    use its bounding box. (This will be ignored if the referenced
    data is not a usable format or doesn't exist.)
    
    This is useful to get the _actual_ dimensions from a field you
    are trying to clamp particles within, since the actual dimensions
    can differ from those specified in the [Gas Resize Field|Node:dop/gasresizefield] node if
    Houdini needs to round to an integer number of voxels and maintain
    a consistent voxel offset.

Reference Point Group:
    If the reference is a geometry, this optionally will specify which points
    in that geometry to use for the reference.  If a point group is specified,
    a point bounding box is computed, so the extents of primitives like spheres
    will not be included.

Center:
    The center of the limit box.

Size:
    The size of the limit box.

Use Reference's Closure:
    If the reference field is a velocity field, then its close x/y/z settings
    will be used rather than the following parameters.

    If there is no reference, or it is not a velocity field, the parameters
    will be used.

Closed Ends:
    Determines what, if any, of the boxes boundaries will be applied.  These
    parameters are designed to match those on the Vector Field DOP.

    X, Y, Z:
        When closed ends is set, these select which sides will be closed.
