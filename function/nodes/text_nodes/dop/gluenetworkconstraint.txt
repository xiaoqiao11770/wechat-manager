= Glue Network Constraint =

"""Glues pairs of RBD objects together according to a polygon network."""

NOTE:
    This DOP does not work with the RBD Solver.

The glue network constraint defines pairs of RBD objects that should be glued
together.  Glued RBD objects move as one whole object until enough force is
applied to break the glue bonds.

With the glue network constraint, SOP Geometry is specified which defines what
objects should be glued.  This makes it easy to procedurally generate a set of
constraint relationships.  Each point in the geometry represents an object, according to the object name attribute.  Each two-point polygon represents
a glue bond.

NOTE:
    Glue Network Constraint is a digital asset.


@parameters

== Data Options ==

Constraint Network:
    The SOP geometry to use to determine the constraints.

Overwrite with SOP:
    The constraint network will be updated and broken by the RBD solver.  This
    flag will re-import it whenever it is set, allowing a completely
    animated glue behavior.

Strength:
    Specifies the bond strength of the glue connections.  A value of -1 means
    the connections will never break.

Half-Life:
    The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one half. Whenever a
    glued object gets hit, it accumulates a glue impulse force. This controls
    how fast that force decays.

Impact Propagations:
    When one of the objects is hit, its impact value is spread along the glue
    network.  This allows distant glue bonds that are weak to be broken prior
    to nearer, strong bonds.  The impact propagations is the number of rounds
    of propagation to do.  Impulses will not travel more than this number of
    bonds each solve step.

Propagate Rate:
    Specifies how much the impacts propagate along each bond.

== Attributes ==

Object Name:
    A point attribute giving the name that each point represents.  More than
    one point can refer to the same object.  If this is a string attribute, it
    is a dopname.  If it is an integer attribute, it is a DOP id.

Strength:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond strength.  If present, the
    attribute value will be multiplied with the __Strength__ parameter.
    However, if the attribute value is -1, the bond will be unbreakable
    regardless of the __Strength__ parameter.  If the __Strength__ 
    parameter is -1, then the primitive attribute will replace the
    parameter.

Half-Life:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond glue impulse rate of decay.
    If present, the attribute value will be multiplied with the __Half-Life__
    parameter.

Propagate Rate:
    The primitive attribute to specify the per bond impact propagation rate.
    If present, the attribute value will be multiplied with the __Propagate Rate__
    parameter.

@inputs
    Object:
	The objects to apply this relationship to, that will be eligible for
	being constrained by the object name attribute.
    Solvers:
	SOP solvers may be attached to update the glue network dynamically in
	response to events.  Only a single geometry is shared by all the
	objects, so this solver is executed once per relationship, not per
	object.
