"""A microsolver that adaptively sharpens a field."""

The Gas Local Sharpen DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Local Sharpen DOP adaptively sharpens a field.   Each voxel looks at
its surrounding values to get a sense of its local range.  A contrast operation
is then performed in this range.  This causes edges to become sharper without
causing small blobs from being extinguished, as would happen with a global
contrast operation.

This is useful for counteracting the tendency of density fields to become
diffused through operations like advection.


@parameters

== Parameters ==

Field to Sharpen:
    The scalar field to sharpen.

Sharpen Rate:
    The amount of contrast adjustment to perform.  This is scaled by the
    timestep to try to keep the same rate of sharpening regardless of substeps.

Locality:
    How many voxels away to search for the local maximum.  Larger
    values increase the sharpening effect, but will be more likely to suppress
    smaller blobs that are within the locality.

[Include:standard_gas_timestep]

== Fields ==

Pre-Sharpen Total:
    A field that stores the total of the field prior to the operation so the average brightness will be preserved.

Post-Sharpen Total:
    A field that stores the total of the field after sharpening, and is used to compute the change required to keep the brightness the same.

Local Max:
    A field that stores the local maximum of each voxel.
