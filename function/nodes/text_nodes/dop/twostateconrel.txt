= Two State Constraint Relationship =

The Two State Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint. 

In a Two State Constraint Relationship, two other [Constraint Relationships|Node:dop/conrelationship]
are attached to this relationship. Based on certain threshold
conditions, the solver can switch from using one relationship subdata to
the other and back again.

This Relationship is useful to simulate tearing of cloth, where a [Hard
Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/hardconrel] becomes a [No Constraint
Relationship|Node:dop/noconrel] when a certain maximum force threshold
is reached. If can also be used when building cloth. A [Spring
Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/springconrel] can become a [Hard
Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/hardconrel] once the springs have
pulled the Anchor points close together.


@parameters
    Minimum State Time:
        #channels: /minstatetime

        Sets the shortest time that the constraint can be in a given
        relationship state. 
        
        Even if other threshold values are exceeded,
        no state transitions occur until the current state has been the
        current state for the __Minimum State Time__.
    Initial State:
        #channels: /currentstate

        Specifies whether the Two State Relationship should start in
        the first or second relationship state.

    == Switch to State 2 ==

        Force:
            Controls the way in which the force exerted by a constraint
            figures into the decision to transition from state 1 to
            state 2.

            Does Not Matter:
                The force exerted by the constraint does not affect the
                transition.
            Must Be Less Than:
                The force exerted by the constraint must be less than a
                particular value for a state transition to occur.
            Must Be Greater Than:
                The force exerted by the constraint must be greater
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
        Force Value:
            #channels: /forcevalue1

            If the constraint force is involved in the state
            transition, this parameter specifies the threshold value.
        Distance:
            Controls the way in which the distance between the Anchor
            values figures into the decision to transition from state 1
            to state 2.

            Does Not Matter:
                The distance between the Anchor values does not affect
                the transition.
            Must Be Less Than:
                The distance between the anchor values must be less
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
            Must Be Greater Than:
                The distance between the anchor values must be greater
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
        Distance Value:
            #channels: /distancevalue1

            If the distance between the Anchor values is involved in
            the state transition, this parameter specifies the threshold
            value.

    == Switch to State 1 ==

        Force:
            Controls the way in which the force exerted by a constraint
            figures into the decision to transition from state 2 to
            state 1.

            Does Not Matter:
                The force exerted by the constraint does not affect the
                transition.
            Must Be Less Than:
                The force exerted by the constraint must be less than a
                particular value for a state transition to occur.
            Must Be Greater Than:
                The force exerted by the constraint must be greater
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
        Force Value:
            #channels: /forcevalue0

            If the constraint force is involved in the state
            transition, this parameter specifies the threshold value.
        Distance:
            Controls the way in which the distance between the Anchor
            values figures into the decision to transition from state 1
            to state 2.

            Does Not Matter:
                The distance between the Anchor values does not affect
                the transition.
            Must Be Less Than:
                The distance between the anchor values must be less
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
            Must Be Greater Than:
                The distance between the anchor values must be greater
                than a particular value for a state transition to occur.
        Distance Value:
            #channels: /distancevalue0

            If the distance between the Anchor values is involved in
            the state transition, this parameter specifies the threshold
            value.
