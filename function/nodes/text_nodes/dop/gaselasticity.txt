"""A microsolver that computes pairwise elastic forces between particles
in a fluid simulation."""

The Gas Elasticity DOP is a microsolver used to build larger fluid
simulations. It is currently used to compute elastic forces in the
[Particle
Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. It computes and optionally applies pairwise
elastic forces between particles. These forces can be thought of as
springs exerting attractive or repulsive forces between pairs of
particles.


@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which elastic
        forces are to be computed.
    Enable Elastic Force:
        Enables or disables elastic forces applied by this DOP.
    Elasticity Constant:
        Controls the magnitude of elastic forces applied by this DOP.
    Compute New Velocity:
        When this option is enabled, the DOP computes forces acting
        between particles and directly modifies the velocity attribute
        of the affected particles. If it is not, the DOP simply places
        the computed forces in the force attribute of the particles.
    Use Particle IDs:
	Determines if the particle springs should store particle
	id numbers or point numbers.  Point numbers are faster to
	work with, but if points are deleted the springs become
	invalid.
