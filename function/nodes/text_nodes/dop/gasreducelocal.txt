"""A microsolver that reduces surrounding voxels to a single value."""

The Gas Reduce Local DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Reduce Local DOP computes for each neighbourhood around a voxel a
single value according to some property of that neighbourhood.  The 
destination field is then set to that value.  The neighbourhood regions are 
always cubic in shape, despite the term radius being used.  

@parameters
    Field:
        The list of fields to reduce.  The reduction is done in place,
	replacing the original field.

    Use Voxel Radius:
	Determine if the radius will be computed from world sizes or voxel
	sizes.
    Radius:
	The world space radius to use for reduction.  This defines the cubic
	region of voxels that will be valid for reduction.

	With the exception of the median reduction, these reductions take about
	the same amount of time regardless of the radius.
    
        NOTE: 
    
            The Maximum, Minimum and Median reductions only work on integer voxel radiuses.

    Voxel Radius:
	The number of voxels to perform the reduction in along each axis.

    Reduction:
	The types of reduction to be performed.

	    Maximum:
		Find largest element of the neighbourhood.  This is a
		sort of dilate operator that will expand a fog into surrounding
		voxels.
	    Minimum:
		Find smallest element of the neighbourhood.  This is a
		sort of erode operator that will shrink a fog.
	    Maximum of Absolute:
		Find largest absolute element of the neighbourhood.  
	    Minimum of Absolute:
		Find smallest absolute element of the neighbourhood.  
	    Average:
		Find the mean of the neighbourhood.  This is equivalent to a
		box blur of the same radius.
	    Median:
		Returns the median, or 50th percentile, of the voxels in the
		neighbourhood.  The true median is not computed, instead an
		approximation is made by using a separable median, ie, finding
		the median along each axis in turn.
	    Sum:
		The total of all voxels in the neighbourhood.
	    Sum of Absolute:
		The total of the absolute value of all the voxels in the
		neighbourhood.
	    Sum of Squares:
		The total of the square each voxel in the neighbourhood.
	    Root Mean Square:
		The square root of the average of the squares of all
		of the voxels in the neighbourhood.

    Scale By:
	Depending on the dimensions of the input field, you may want
	to also apply an additional scale to make the result
	independent of your voxel resolution.

	None:
	    Do not apply any scaling effects.
	By Voxel Length:
	    Scale by the length of a voxel, defined as the cube root
	    of the voxel's volume.
	By Voxel Area:
	    Scale by the area of the voxel, defined as the square of
	    the cube root of the voxel's volume.  Use this to turn the
	    result of a SDF to Surface into a surface area.
	By Voxel Volume:
	    Scale by the volume of the voxel.  Use this to turn the
	    result of an SDF to Fog into a volume.
