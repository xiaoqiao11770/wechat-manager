= Slider Constraint Relationship =

The Slider Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint DOP|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint.

A Slider Constraint Relationship specifies a hinge axis along which
translation and rotation may take place. The range of motion is
described by specifying a maximum rotation and range of translation.

Parameters describing how the constraint is applied are broken up into
two sets. Each of these parameters is prefixed by __Hinge__
or __Ortho__ . Parameters prefixed by __Hinge__ affect how the
constraint is applied when the current rotation or translation on the
hinge axis have exceeded the defined limits. Parameters
prefixed by __Ortho__ affect how the constraint is applied when
rotation or translation has occurred on axes other than the hinge
axis.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters
    == Data Options ==

	Max Rotation:
	    The maximum rotation about the hinge axis in degrees.
	Slide Range:
	    The range in which the constrained object may slide.
	Axes:
	    Goal Hinge Axis:
		#channels: /goal_hinge_axisx /goal_hinge_axisy /goal_hinge_axisz

		The goal direction the constraint may slide or rotate
		on. Defaults to the X axis.
	    Goal Up Axis:
		#channels: /goal_up_axisx /goal_up_axisy /goal_up_axisz

		The goal direction of the up axis. Defaults to the Y axis.
		This should be perpendicular to the hinge axis. The out axis
		is calculated as the cross product of the hinge and up axes.
	    Constrained Hinge Axis:
		#channels: /constrained_hinge_axisx /constrained_hinge_axisy /constrained_hinge_axisz

		The initial hinge axis of the constrained object.
	    Constrained Up Axis:
		#channels: /constrained_up_axisx /constrained_up_axisy /constrained_up_axisz

		The initial up axis of the constrained object. This should be
		perpendicular to the constrained hinge axis.
	Hinge:
	    Position Softness:
		#channels: /hinge_position_softness

		Increase this to soften the bounds on position along the hinge
		axis. This specifies the rate at which the constraint corrects
		positional errors along the hinge axis.
	    Position Damping:
		#channels: /hinge_position_damping

		Increase this to cause the constrained object to bounce once
		it has slid to the end of its range.  When the constrained
		object reaches a positional limit along the hinge axis, a
		higher damping value increases the velocity in the direction
		opposite the current direction along the hinge axis.
	    Position Cfm:
		#channels: /hinge_position_cfm

		Increase this to loosen the bounds on position along the hinge
		axis, and potentially increase the stability of the
		simulation. The positional constraint along the hinge axis may
		be violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
		re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
	    Angle Softness:
		#channels: /hinge_angle_softness

		Increase this to soften the bounds on rotation about the hinge
		axis. This specifies the rate at which the constraint corrects
		rotational errors around the hinge axis.
	    Angle Damping:
		#channels: /hinge_angle_damping

		Increase this to cause the constrained object to bounce once
		it has rotated to the end of its range.	 When the constrained
		object reaches an angular limit around the hinge axis, a
		higher damping value increases the angular velocity in the
		direction opposite the current direction around the hinge
		axis.
	    Angle Cfm:
		#channels: /hinge_angle_cfm

		Increase this to loosen the bounds on rotation about the hinge
		axis, and potentially increase the stability of the
		simulation. The angular constraint about the hinge axis may be
		violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
		re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
	Ortho:
	    Position Softness:
		#channels: /ortho_position_softness

		Increase this to the soften the alignment of the position of
		the goal and constrained hinge axes. This specifies the rate
		at which the constraint corrects positional errors around axes
		other than the hinge axis.
	    Position Cfm:
		#channels: /ortho_position_cfm

		Increase this to loosen the alignment of the position of the
		goal and constrained hinge axes, and potentially increase the
		stability of the simulation. The positional constraint along
		axes other than the hinge axis may be violated by an amount
		proportional to the force required to re-establish the
		constraint, times this parameter.
	    Angle Softness:
		#channels: /ortho_angle_softness

		Increase this to soften the alignment of the rotation of the
		goal and constrained hinge axes. This specifies the rate at
		which the constraint corrects rotational errors around axes
		other than the hinge axis.
	    Angle Cfm:
		#channels: /ortho_angle_cfm

		Increase this to loosen the alignment of the rotation of the goal
		and constrained hinge axes, and potentially increase the
		stability of the simulation. The angular constraint along axes
		other than the hinge axis may be violated by an amount
		proportional to the force required to re-establish the
		constraint, times this parameter.
