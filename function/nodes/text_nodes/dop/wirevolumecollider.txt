= Wire/Volume Collider =

""" Defines a way of resolving collisions involving a wire object and
DOPs objects with volumetric representations. """

The Wire/Volume Collider DOP can be used to resolve collisions between
a wire object and a solid object using a volume representation.


@parameters
    Volume Offset:
        #channels: /offset

        The wire/volume collisions use a volumetric representation of
        the affector. This is only an approximation of the affector's
        geometry. 
        
        The __Volume Offset__ is used to make the affector object
        act larger or smaller for positive/negative values respectively.
        This is equivalent to changing the __Offset__ parameter of a [Volume
        DOP|Node:dop/volume] on the affector object.
