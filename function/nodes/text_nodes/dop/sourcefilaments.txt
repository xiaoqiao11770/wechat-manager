"""Imports vortex filaments from a SOP network."""

This microsolver imports [vortex filaments|/dopparticles/filaments] (represented by closed polygonal curves) from a geometry network into the simulation.

See the [filaments page|/dopparticles/filaments] for more information.

@parameters

== Vortex Filaments ==

SOP Path:
    The path to a SOP or object containing the curves to import.

Activation:
    Turns this node on and off. The node is only active if this value is greater than 0.
    You can use an [expression|/expressions] to, for example, only grab the filament geometry every 10th frame.

Operation:
    Controls what this node does with the geometry it grabs from the SOP network.

    Append:
        Merge the geometry the existing filament geometry.
        Use this to emit new filaments at specific frames.

    Overwrite:
        Replace any existing filaments with the geometry.
        Use this to bring animated vortex filaments into a simulation.

Scale Strength:
    Adjusts the strength of each filament. The `strength` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

Scale Thickness:
    Adjusts the thickness of each filament. The `thickness` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

== Bindings ==

Geometry:
    The name of the simulation data to apply the microsolver to.
