= Intangible Value =

"""Marks a simulation object as intangible or tangible."""

Merge nodes in the DOP Network will apply the specified relationship
to all the input geometry.  This can be a problem if you have a helper
object in one of your object streams.  This helper object's role has
been expended in the upstream, and it shouldn't become a collider,
source, etc, to anyone downstream.

The __Intangible__ parameter, when set to `1`, will cause the object to be ignored in all merge relationship chains.


@parameters
    Intangible:
        Controls whether the object is tangible or intangible.
	Intangible objects will be ignored in merge DOPs.
