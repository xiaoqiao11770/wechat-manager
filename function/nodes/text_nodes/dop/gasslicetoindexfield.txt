"""A microsolver that computes slice numbers into an index field."""

The Gas Slice To Index Field DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users can attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Slice To Index Field DOP computes the slice number for each voxel of an index field and stores it into the index field.  This can be used to efficiently determine which slice a particular voxel belongs to when doing distribution
with slices.

If no slice data is found, -1 is written to the voxels.

Because of floating point drift when computing voxel locations, different
machines may disagree about which voxel belongs to which slice.  The
distribution options are thus present to first synchronize and use the
zeroth slice's index field as authoratative for determing voxel locations.

@parameters

Index Field:
    The index field to store the slice numbers.

Slice Data Root:
    The root data to build our slice topology from.

    If this is blank, the index field's own slicing will be used to
    initialize the slice numbers.
