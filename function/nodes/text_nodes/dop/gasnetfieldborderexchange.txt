"""A microsolver that exchanges boundary data between multiple
machines."""

The Gas Net Field Border Exchange DOP is a microsolver used in
building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Net Field Border Exchange DOP exchanges the field values along
the border of a slice with the neighbouring slices in a distributed
simulation.

@parameters
    Fields:
	The scalar, vector, and matrix fields to exchange.  The Slice
	parameters for these fields will be used to determine the
	slice number and number of slices.  Only the voxels that lie
	in the overlap area, as determined by the Overlap Voxels
	Positive and Overlap Voxels Negative will be transfered.

    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Blend Method:
	How to blend the fields together.

	Average:
	    Voxels in the overlap region will be averaged together
	    with their neighbour's values.

	Overlap:
	    Each slice's interior voxels will be overwrite the overlap
	    voxels of its neighbours.  This can produce a hard
	    transition in values.

	Linear:
	    A linear blend is done from the completely interior to
	    completely exterior voxels.  This smooths out transitions.

	Linear External:
	    The voxels interior values are not changed, but the
	    overlap values are blended smoothly in the external range.
	    This is best used with one-way coupling between the
	    slices.
