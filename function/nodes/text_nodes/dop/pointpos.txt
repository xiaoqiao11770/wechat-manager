= Point Position =

""" Creates position information from a point on some SOP geometry. """

The Point Position DOP creates a special kind of position that uses the
information from a point on a piece of SOP geometry.

The point's orientation and position is determined in the same manner
as the [Copy SOP|Node:sop/copy] or Mantra instancing.

NOTE:
    The `vel`, `p`, etc, parameters are read only because they come from SOPs. If you want to override them, you need to use an [RBD State DOP|Node:dop/rbdstate] to convert to something writeable. The SIM_Motion and SIM_Position nodes won't work.


@parameters
    SOP Path:
        Path to the SOP containing the desired point.
    Use Object Transform:
        The transform of the object containing the chosen SOP is
        applied to the point to get its world space position.
    Time:
        The time at which the SOP should be evaluated to generate the
        geometry point. By setting this value to `$T`, and changing the
        __Default Operation__ to __Set Always__, it is possible to bring
        in animated point data from a SOP.
    Point Group:
        Setting this parameter to the name of a point group confines
        the rest of the options for this data to points within that
        group.
    Point Number:
        Controls which point is used to create the position
        information. If the __Point Group__ is set, this is an index
        into that point group; otherwise, it is the point number within
        the SOP geometry.
    Rotate to Normal:
        Determines if the position should be oriented to match the
        point's normal. If enabled, the point will determine an
        orientation using the normal and up vector attributes, if
        present. If no normal attribute is present, the velocity is
        used.
    Extra Attributes:
        Any attributes associated with the geometry point can be pulled
        into the position data. This parameter specifies a mask that
        determines which point attributes to copy from the point into
        the position data. Attributes copied in this way can be accessed
        as part of the position data using the `dopfield` expression,
        and using the attribute name as the field name.

        Note that attributes used for determining the position
        attribute, such as the velocity and angular velocity attributes,
        will not be extracted using this field.
