"""Dynamically fractures objects based on data from the Voronoi
Fracture Configure Object DOP"""

== Overview ==

When you attach this solver to an object with Voronoi Fracture Parms
data (usually created by a [Voronoi Fracture Configure
Object DOP|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject]), it will
dynamically fracture the attached Geometry data based on impact data
attached to the object by the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rigidbodysolver].  It
uses the [Voronoi Fracture Points SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracturepoints]
to generate fracture points from the impacts, then the [Voronoi
Fracture SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracture] to fracture the geometry.

The solver attaches the resulting fractured geometry, if any, to each solved
object in its __FracturedGeo__ data. For [RBD Packed
Objects|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject], the solver will create a new packed
primitive for each fractured piece and add it to the object's geometry.
For [RBD Objects|Node:dop/rbdobject], the [Voronoi Fracture Configure Object
DOP|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] will create new objects from this
geometry on the next timestep.

This solver is implemented as a [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] that processes geometry after the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rigidbodysolver], so the simulation and fracturing will appear smoother since the __Substeps__ parameter on the DOP network is increased.  Values in the range of 2-4 usually work well.  

NOTE: 

    This solver creates point velocities on any fractured pieces that represent their velocity at the time of fracturing. You can ignore these fracture-time velocities by turning off the __Add to Existing Velocity Attributes__ parameter on any [DopImport|Node:sop/dopimport] nodes that import this geometry when rendering these pieces with __Geometry Velocity Blur__.
