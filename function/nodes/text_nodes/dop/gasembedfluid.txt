"""A microsolver that embeds one fluid inside another."""

The Gas Embed Fluid DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Embed Fluid DOP takes the extra fields fetched with the Gas
Fetch Fields To Embed and applies them to the fluid simulation to
force the velocity and other fields to match that of the fetched
fluid.  This allows one to drive a large fluid simulation with a high
resolution, but smaller one.

@parameters
    Data Prefix:
	A unique prefix for all of the fetched data.  This has to
	match the prefix used by the Gas Fetch Fields To Embed Dop.
    Mask Inset:
	This fluid is updated from the fetched fluid wherever the
	fetched fluid exists.  However, to give smooth end conditions,
	one may mask out boundary velocities by ignoring the fetched
	fluid according to the Mask Inset value.
    Mask Feather Width:
	Provides a smooth fall off from zero to one over this distance
	in the fetched fluid's mask.
    Source Type:
	Depending on the type of fluid fetched, different fields are
	needed.  This determines which fields need to be fetched and
	how they should be applied.
