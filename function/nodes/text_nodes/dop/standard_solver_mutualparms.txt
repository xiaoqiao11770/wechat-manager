Make Objects Mutual Affectors:
    All objects connected to the first input of this node become mutual
    affectors. 
    
    This is equivalent to using an [Affector
    DOP|Node:dop/affector] to create an affector relationship between
    `*` and `*` before connecting it to this node. This option makes it
    convenient to have all objects feeding into a solver node affect
    each other.
