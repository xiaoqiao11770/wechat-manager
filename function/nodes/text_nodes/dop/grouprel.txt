= Group Relationship =

The Group Relationship DOP is used to create a simple object group. In a
relationship of this type, only the affected objects matter. The contents of the affector object list is ignored. Relationships of this type do not affect the solve order of the simulation objects even if the affector object list is not empty. 

Object groups can also be created by the
[Group DOP|Node:dop/group], which also creates relationships like this node. It just provides a different interface. This node used in conjunction with an [Apply Relationship DOP|Node:dop/applyrel] can provide a more powerful way of creating groups than the [Group DOP|Node:dop/group].
