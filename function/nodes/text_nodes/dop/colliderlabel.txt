= Collider Label =

The Collider Label DOP provides a way to control what type of collision
detection algorithm a solver should use for an object. When detecting
collisions, a solver must determine what "type" of objects are involved
so it can pick the right collision detection algorithm. The Collider
Label provides this "type" information. 

For example, most RBD objects are identified with a collider label of "Volume". This means that for collision detection purposes, the [RBD object|Node:dop/rbdobject] should be treated as a
volume. This lets solvers know that they need to make sure the object
has Volume data attached to its geometry. [Cloth objects|Node:dop/clothobject] have a Collider
Label of "Cloth" which indicates that for collision detection purposes
they should be treated as a flat surface made up of triangles.

If an object does not have a Collider Label attached to it, the solver
attached to the object provides a default Collider Label. For the RBD
Solver, this default is "Volume" because most RBD objects are treated
this way.

The Collider Label data is also where Collider data can be attached.
Since collision detection requires two objects, it is actually the
combination of the Collider Label on one object with the Colliders
attached to the other object that determine the collision detection
method a solver will use. Suppose a solver is detecting collisions
between objects A and B. Object A has a Collider Label of "Cloth". The
solver for object B finds this value, and looks at the Collider Label on
object B. The actual Collider Label value on B does not matter. Instead,
the solver looks for subdata on B's Collider Label with the name "Cloth"
(to match the Collider Label of A). If A Collider is found with the
right name, the solver uses that Collider. Otherwise the object B solver
creates a default Collider based on object A's Collider Label, and
attaches this new default Collider as subdata on B's solver.

        This specifies the label that will be used by solvers to
        control which collision detection method to use for this object.
        
        There are several standard values that can be chosen from a
        menu. Or a custom value can be created to provide more precise
        control over the collision method used for specific objects.
