= RBD Spring Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to remain a certain distance from the constraint,
with a set amount of springiness."""

This involves constraining some location on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to a
"goal" location derived from another simulation object or from a
position in world space.

RBD Spring Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] used to determine the goal
            position. If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space used to initialize the
            local object space position of the constraint in the goal
            object.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.

    == Spring ==

        Strength:
            #channels: /strength

            Controls how strongly the spring constraint acts on the
            constrained object to return the anchors to the rest length
            separation.
        Rest Length:
            #channels: /restlength

            Sets the rest length of the spring relationship. The force
            applied on a constrained object by a solver will tend to
            keep the object this distance away from the goal.
        Damping:
            #channels: /damping

            Controls the amount of damping in the spring relationship.
            As damping increases, the spring constraint acts more slowly
            and oscillates less.
        Limit Force:
            #channels: /limitforce

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            force applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds the maximum
            specified by the __Maximum Force__ parameter.
        Maximum Force:
            #channels: /maxforce

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. If the force
            applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds this threshold,
            the constraint will be disabled.
        Limit Length:
            #channels: /limitlength

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            distance between the two ends of this constraint exceeds the
            maximum specified by the __Maximum Length__ parameter.
        Maximum Length:
            #channels: /maxlength

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. If the
            distance between the two ends of this constraint exceeds
            this threshold, the constraint will be disabled.
