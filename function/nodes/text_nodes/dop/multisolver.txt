= Multiple Solver =

The Multiple Solver DOP causes a simulation object to be solved by more
than one Solver at each timestep. Each solver attached to this node is
applied in order to the object.

Many solver combinations will produce strange or unexpected results.
For example, applying two RBD Solvers will simply make objects move
twice as fast. 

The most useful solver combinations are ones where each
solver acts on a different piece of data on the object. For example, the
RBD Solver alters the Position data of an object. This may be followed
by a SOP Solver that modifies the geometry of the object based on the
position, velocity, or impact information generated by the RBD Solver.

It is important that you make sure the attached solvers have different
names. Solvers by default all have the name "Solver" and will thus
overwrite each other. The __Unique Data Name__ toggle on the incoming
solvers can be used to ensure that the names are different.


@parameters
    Primary Solver:
        #channels: /primarysolver

        Specifies which sub-solver to use when other solvers make
        queries about the objects to which this solver is applied. This
        includes information such as what collision method to use, the
        mass of the object, or physical properties like friction. 

	This
        value should be set to point to the sub-solver that best
        represents how other objects in the scene should react to these
        objects.
