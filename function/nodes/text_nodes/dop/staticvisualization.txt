"""Allows you to inspect the behavior of a static object in the viewport."""

The Static Visualization DOP allows you to inspect the behavior of a
static object in the viewport. It can display the thickness and velocity
of the object. This is particularly useful when observing interactions
between cloth and a static object. 

@parameters

Thickness:
    #id: thicknessenable
    
    Visualize the static object's thickness.

Thickness Color:
    #id: thicknesscolor

    Color of the static object's thickness guide geometry.

Velocity:
    #id: velocityenable

    Visualize per-point velocities.
    
Velocity Scale:
    #id: velocityscale

    Scale of the lines showing per-point velocity when __Velocity__
    is on. Try increasing this if your turn on __Velocity__ but the
    lines are not visible.
    
Velocity Color:
    #id: velocitycolor

    Color of per-point velocity lines when __Velocity__ is on.
