= POP Velocity =

"""A POP node that directly changes the velocity of particles."""

The POP Velocity node directly alters the velocity of particles.

It is important to note that zeroing the velocity will not stop the particle
from moving!  During the integration, the particle may receive forces giving it
a non-zero velocity during the timestep.  The `force` and `targetv` attributes
need to also be zeroed to make the particle stop.

By default, the velocity parameter is multiplied by the scale parameter, and
this value is written directly to the velocity attribute.  The VEXpression
can be used to make the outgoing velocity parameter be a function of
the particle's original velocity using the `@v` variable, as shown
in the examples.

This operator modifies the `v` attribute.

    == Parameters ==
	Velocity:
	    The new velocity of the particles.   Can also be used as an axis
	    parameter, for example when the Project on Plane preset is used.
	Scale:
	    A multiplier for the velocity.
