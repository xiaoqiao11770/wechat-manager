""" Sets and configures a Rigid Body Dynamics solver. """

The RBD Solver DOP sets objects to use the Rigid Body Dynamics solver.

If an object has this DOP as its `Solver` subdata, it will evolve itself as an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject].

This solver is a union of two different rigid body engines, the RBD engine and the ODE engine.  The RBD engine uses volumes and is useful for complicated, deforming, stacked, geometry.  The ODE engine uses simple primitives and is useful for fast simulations of boxes and spheres.

The ODE Solver is useful for simple shapes because of its quick processing speed; however, it is restricted to a limited number of basic shapes.

Details on the first engine are found in the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver].

The RBD engine also has support for voronoi fracturing. For more information see the [Voronoi Fracture Solver|Node:dop/voronoifracturesolver] help. You must have a [Voronoi Fracture Configure Object|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] for voronoi fracturing to work.

Details on the second engine are found in the [ODE Solver|Node:dop/odesolver].

@inputs

Objects:
    The objects to solve.

Pre-Solve:
    Microsolvers attached to this input will run before the main solve step. For example, a [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] can be used to modfiy the object's geometry, and POP force nodes can be used to [apply forces|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject#forceattributes] to specific objects.

Post-Solve:
    Microsolvers attached to this input will run after the main solve step.

@outputs

[Include:standard_data_outputs]

@locals
