= Geometry Copy =

The Geometry Copy DOP is a type of Geometry data that can be modified
and manipulated by solvers. If you use the SOP Geometry DOP to attach
geometry to a Simulation Object, the geometry cannot be modified because
it is still owned by the original SOP. You can convert any Geometry data
into a Geometry Copy data using this DOP. The resulting data is a copy
of the geometry, so can be altered by the solver.

Usually this node is not required because each solver does its own
conversion of geometry data from its original form to a Geometry Copy.
However in addition to containing editable geometry data, this data type
also contains an editable transform. So by attaching this node to an
object that already has some other Geometry data type attached to it,
that original geometry can be copied and have an arbitrary transform
applied to it. This approach is used by the [RBD Point Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpointobject] to
apply a different scale to each geometry instance based on the scale
attribute of the source points.


@parameters
    Transform Order:
        Determines the order in which the various components of the
        transform are applied to generate the overall transform.
    Rotate Order:
        Determines the order in which the various components of the
        rotation are applied to generate the overall rotation component
        of the transform.

        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Translation along xyz axes.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Rotation about xyz axes specified in degrees.
    Scale:
