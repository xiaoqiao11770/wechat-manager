Initial Geometry:
    #channels: /soppath

    This geometry determines the initial simulated state of the object. It determines the initial position and velocity for each of the points.
    
    This is the geometry that is used for the computation of internal forces and for collision detection. Don't use more tetrahedrons than you need to get a good looking motion; more tetrahedrons does not always translate to more quality. The fewer tetrahedrons you use, the better the simulation speed is. If extra detail needs to be added, it is recommended that you use the __Embedded Geometry__.

    You can use the Tetrahedralize SOP to create a suitable input mesh. It is important that you enable the quality option on the Tetrahedralize SOP. Otherwise, the interior of your Solid Object won't have enough degrees of freedom to be flexible.
