"""A microsolver that exchanges boundary data between multiple machines."""

The Gas Net Slice Exchange DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Net Slice Exchange DOP exchanges the particle and particle values along
the border of a slice with the neighbouring slices in a distributed
simulation.

The topology of the slicing is determined by Slice by Plane or Slice
Along Line DOPs.

NOTE:
    Correspondance is done with the `id` attribute so it is important
    that particles have unique ids.  If new particles are created,
    they need to be created the same way on all nodes to avoid
    having mismatched ids.

@parameters
    Geometry:
	The particle system to do the slice transfer with.

    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Slice Data Root:
	The root data to build our slice topology from.

    ID Attribute:
	The particle system's unique id attribute.  This is used so
	particles in separate machines can be recognized as the same
	particle.

    Slice Attribute:
	The attribute that stores which slice is currently owning the
	particle.

    Attributes to Exchange:
	When in Exchange Attribute mode, these attributes will be
	copied across the slice boundary.  Specifically, any particle
	in the overlap band which is owned by this slice will be
	broadcast to the neighbouring slices.  They will then use
	that to update their own versions of that particle.

    Slice Overlap:
	The distance in world space to extend the slices.

    Particle Overlap:
	The distance in particle radiuses to extend the slices.

    Assign Slice #:
	Creates and initializes the slice attribute to track who owns
	each particle.

    Exchange Attribs:
	Exchanges attribute values across the slice boundaries.

    Transfer Points:
	Determines if points are now on the wrong side of their slice
	boundaries.  If so, moves them to the correct machine.
	This makes Exchange Attribs irrelevant.

    Delete External:
	Deletes any points that are outside of the overlap distance of
	the current slice.

    Compute Slice Distance:
	Creates and sets a `slicedist` attribute storing the distance
	to the slices boundary.  Negative values are interior.

    Normalize Slice Distance:
	Divides the slice distance by the overlap amount, giving
	a resolution independent value 0 at the border and 1 at
	the end of the overlap.
