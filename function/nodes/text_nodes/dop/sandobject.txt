= Sand Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Sand Objects to an object."""

The Sand Object DOP creates a Sand Object inside a DOP simulation. It
creates a new object and attaches the data which is needed for it to be
used as a Sand Object.

    == Initial Data ==

        SOP Path:
            This is a path to the SOP that will be used to initialize
            the surface of the fluid. It should be a volume primitive
            which stores the signed distance to the fluid, such as that
            generated by the [Iso Offset SOP|Node:sop/isooffset] with the __Output SDF Volume__ option.

	    This SOP is assigned to the origsurface scalar field that
	    is then deleted after the creation frame.

        Closed Boundaries:
            The velocity field can be clamped to prevent any fluid from
            entering or leaving the box. If closed boundaries is not
            set, the velocity on the boundary will be allowed to vary,
            allowing fluid to leave the box.
        
            X, Y, Z:
                When closed boundaries is set, these select which
                sides will be closed.

    == Guides ==

        Each of the fields that define the fluid simulation can be
        visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the Scalar Field
        Visualization or Vector Field Visualization provides more
        details about how these work.

        single output.
