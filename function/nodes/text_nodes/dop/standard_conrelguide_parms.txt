#type: include

== Guide Options ==

    Show Guide Geometry:
        Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in
        the viewport representing this constraint.
    Radius:
        #channels: /guiderad

        Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as
        guide geometry for this constraint.
        
    Color:
        Sets the color of the constraint in the viewport.

        Using different colors for hard and spring constraint relationships makes it easy to see when a two state constraint switches from one state to the other.
        
    Show Object Link:
        #channels: /showobjectlink

        This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
        connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
