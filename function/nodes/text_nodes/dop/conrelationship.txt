= Constraint Relationship =

The Constraint Relationship DOP encapsulates some of the most common
constraint relationship setups into a single convenient asset. This node
is used in all the RBD and Cloth Constraint assets to provide a common
set of parameters for controlling the constraint relationship.

This asset does not provide a complete set of all possible constraint
relationships. In particular the two state relationship has many more
possible configurations than the ones exposed by this asset. See the
help for the separate constraint relationship nodes for more
information.

    == Guide Options ==

        Radius:
            #channels: /guiderad

            Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as
            guide geometry for this constraint.
        Hard Color:
            #channels: /hardguidecolorr /hardguidecolorg /hardguidecolorb

            If this is a hard constraint relationship, this parameter
            controls the color of the guide geometry. Using different
            colors for hard and spring constraint relationships makes it
            easy to see when a two state constraint switches from one
            state to the other.
        Spring Color:
            #channels: /springguidecolorr /springguidecolorg /springguidecolorb

            If this is a spring constraint relationship, this parameter
            controls the color of the guide geometry.
