""""""

The RBD Visualization DOP allows inspection of the behavior of the RBD
simulation in the viewport. It can display collision impacts acting on
the objects.

This DOP requires the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver] to add impact data to the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject]
during solving.


@parameters
    Impacts:
        Turn this on to see impacts in the viewport. 
        
        The impacts may
        appear in strange locations: they are shown at the position
        where a collision _would_ have happened.
    Impacts Scale:
        #channels: /impactsscale

        This is used to define the scale of the lines drawn in the
        viewport to show impacts. 
        
        Use a small value if the lines are too
        long and distracting, and a large value if you can't see the
        lines.
    Impacts Color:
        #channels: /impactscolorr /impactscolorg /impactscolorb

        Use this parameter to choose the color for impacts in the
        viewport.
