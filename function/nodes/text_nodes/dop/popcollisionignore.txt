= POP Collision Ignore =

"""A POP node marks particles to ignore implicit collisions."""

This node marks particles to not engage in implicit collisions performed by the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver].  This allows you to turn off bouncing on a subset of particles.

NOTE:
	This only affects collisions in the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] node itself, not in any [POP Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect] nodes.

This operator modifies the `collisionignore` attribute.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==

	Collision Ignore:
	    Which DOP Objects to not collide with in the implicit collision stage. `*` will disable all collisions, an empty string will enable all collisions.  This can be the name of DOP Objects, the ID of DOP Objects, or DOP Groups.

	    `* ^torus*` will cause the particles to only collide with objects whose name starts with `torus`.
