"""A microsolver that uses techniques from Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics to compute pressure, viscosity and surface tension forces
acting between particles in a fluid simulation."""

The Gas SPH Forces DOP is a microsolver used to build larger fluid
simulations. It is currently used to compute forces in the [Particle
Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. It computes and optionally applies pairwise pressure,
viscosity and surface tension forces between particles.

Pressure forces applied by this DOP use the density and restdensity
attributes of the particle set. The force acts to return particles to
their rest density by pulling particles together when their density
drops below their rest density, and pushing them apart when their
density rises above their rest density.

Viscosity has the effect of smoothing the particle velocity field, and
a highly viscous fluid will appear thicker and less willing to flow than
a fluid with low viscosity.

Surface tension has the effect of pulling in particles close to the
fluid surface. This tends to round out the particle field.


@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which forces are
        to be computed.
    Enable Pressure Force:
        Enables or disables pressure forces between particles. The
        magnitude of the pressure forces applied is controlled by the
        __Gas Constant__ parameter.
    Enable Viscosity Force:
        Enables or disables viscosity forces between particles. The
        magnitude of the viscous forces applied is controlled by the
        value of the viscosity attribute stored by the particles
        themselves.
    Enable Surface Tension Force:
        Enables or disables surface tension forces between particles.
        The magnitude of surface tension forces is controlled by the
        value of the `surfacetension` attribute stored by the particles
        themselves.
    Gas Constant:
        Controls the magnitude of the pressure forces applied by this
        DOP.
    Compute New Velocity:
        When this option is enabled, the DOP computes forces acting
        between particles and directly modifies the velocity attribute
        of the affected particles. If it is not, the DOP simply places
        the computed forces in the force attribute of the particles.
