"""Constrains agent velocity to only go in a direction within a certain angle range of its current heading, to prevent agents from floating backward."""

This node is used internally in the [Crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver]. It relies on the crowd system's `steerforce` attribute, so unlike other "POP Steer" nodes it is not also useful for plain particles.

This node modifies agent/particle speed based on its orientation and target velocity direction. It will be scaled based on agent orientation/facing direction and velocity direction. Value of zero will result in speed unaffected, where at __Max Angle__ the speed will be zero. Any values in between will be linearly scaled 0 to 1.

@parameters

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#activate]

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#group]

Use:
    The attribute to use as the agent/particle's direction/velocity. The default "Velocity" uses the `v` attribute. Choose "Custom vector" if you want to use a custom attribute.

Custom Vector:
    When __Use__ is "Custom vector", the name of the custom attribute to use.

Min Angle:
	Minimum angle between agent orientation and target velocity where speed is unaffected.
    
Max Angle:
	Maximum angle between agent orientation and target velocity where speed is zero.
    
Reference Direction:
	Orientation is calculated relative to this direction.
    
Reference Object:
	Custom object to be used for reference.
    
Use Up Vector:
	Use __Up__ as the agent's up vector.
    
Up:
	An up vector to use when calculating the agent's heading.

Reference Up:
