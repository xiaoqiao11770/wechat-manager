= Cloth/Volume Collider =

"""Defines a way of resolving collisions involving a cloth object and
DOPs objects with volumetric representations (RBD Objects, ground
planes, etc.)"""

The Cloth/Volume Collider DOP can be used to resolve collisions between
a cloth object and a solid object using a volume representation, such as
an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject], a [Ground
Plane|Node:dop/groundplane], or any DOPs object with geometry.

[Include:standard_clothvolume]

@parameters
    Volume Offset:
        #channels: /offset

        This parameter allows you to collide the cloth against an
        expanded or reduced version of the solid object. 
        
        A positive value will make the solid object act larger than it actually is.
        For example, the default setting of 0.01m (1cm) will expand the
        volume by 1cm outwards in every direction. A negative value will
        make the solid object act smaller than it actually is.

        This setting is equivalent to changing the __Offset__ parameter
        of the [Volume DOP|Node:dop/volume] attached to the solid
        object, except that it only affects interactions between this
        piece of cloth and the solid object.

        If you are seeing little parts of the volume poking through the
        triangles of the cloth (due to the surface representation of the
        cloth), this parameter can be quite useful. To fix these, set
        the parameter to the length of a typical edge of the cloth.
