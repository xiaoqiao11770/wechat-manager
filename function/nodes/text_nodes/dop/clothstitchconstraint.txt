= Cloth Stitch Constraint =

"""Constrains part of the boundary of a cloth object to the boundary of another cloth object."""

This constraint can be used to connect a list of cloth points of a cloth object to a list of corresponding points on another object. The rest angle can be controlled using the __Seam Angle__ parameter on the [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject].

@parameters

== Constraint ==

    Type:
        #channels: /type

        Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint. Hard constraints are always enforced exactly. The soft constraints create forces instead.

    Constrained Object:
        #channels: /constrainedobject

        The cloth object to stitch to another object.

    Constrained Points:
        #channels: /constrainedpoints

        The ordered list of boundary points that defines one end of the stitch seam.

    Goal Object:
        #channels: /goalobject

        The cloth object to which to stitch.

    Goal Points:
        #channels: /goalpoints

        The ordered list of boundary points that defines the other end of the stitch seam.

== Soft Controls ==

Stiffness:
    When the constraint __Type__ is __Soft__, this controls how quickly the corresponding stitch points will come together.

Damping:
    When the constraint __Type__ is __Soft__, this controls how quickly the points on each side of the stitch will adapt velocities to each other. Using one percent of the stiffness usually gives a good starting point for this value.

== Guide Options ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.

Radius:
    #channels: /guiderad

    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.

Color:
    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

    Controls the color of the guide geometry.

Show Object Link:
    #channels: /showobjectlink

    Controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
