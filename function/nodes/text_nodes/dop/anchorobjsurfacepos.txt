= Anchor: Object Surface Position =

"""Defines multiple attachment points on a polygonal surface of an object."""

The Anchor: Object Surface Position belongs to a class of DOP nodes 
that define position or orientation values for building constraints. 

This anchor defines multiple attachment points on a polygonal surface of an object. The surface is specified by a group of primitives on the geometry of a simulation object.

@parameters
    Object:
	#channels: /object

	The object whose simulation geometry data which will be used to create the attachment points.

    Primmitive Group:
	#channels:  /primitivegroup

	The selection of primitives that define the surface on which the attachment points must lie.
