= Thin Plate/Thin Plate Collider =

""" Defines a way of resolving collisions between two rigid bodies. """

The Thin Plate/Thin Plate Collider DOP can be used to resolve
collisions between any two rigid bodies. It performs collision detection
using only the surfaces of the two rigid bodies. 

The Thin Plate/Thin Plate Collider DOP is most useful for situations where both rigid bodies have negligible volume. Cases where at least one rigid body has thick
features are better handled by the Volume/Volume Collider DOP.


@parameters

    == Data Options ==

        Collision Iterations:
            #channels: /collidemaxiter

            Number of collision iterations to be done by the Solver.
            The solver might choose to ignore this option.
        Collision Tolerance:
            #channels: /collidetol

            The maximum separation for which two objects are considered
            to be colliding.
        [Include:standard_rorcollider_parms]


    == Guide Options ==

        Show Guide Geometry:
            When turned on, this option displays the oriented bounding
            boxes that enclose the primitives.
        Guide Depth:
            #channels: /guidedepth

            This displays the bounding boxes at a certain depth in the
            tree. A value of -1 displays all the bounding boxes. 
            
            NOTE:
                Both __Guide Depth__ and __Guide Primitive__ should not be set to -1.
        Guide Primitive:
            #channels: /guideprim

            This displays the bounding box for the specified primitive.
            A value of -1 displays the bounding boxes for all
            primitives. 
            
            NOTE:
                Both __Guide Depth__ and __Guide Primitive__ should not be set to -1.
