"""A DOP node that adds the appropriately formatted data to represent
vorticles."""

The Gas Vorticle Geometry DOP is a node that creates the properly
formatted data to represent vorticles.

Vorticles are points that have paddlewheel-like forces associated with
them.  They are designed to move passively through the fluid adding
extra force to vorticles to avoid dissipation.  The default Smoke and
Fluid Solvers look for geometry called "vorticles" and apply the
appropriate forces and move them over time.  This DOP is responsible
for adding the geometry called "vorticles" to the object.

There are two ways of using this operator.  One can seed a bounding
box with a fixed number of uniformly distributed particles.
Alternatively, one can import a normal SOP geometry and add the proper
vortex attributes to the points.

@parameters
    Display:
        Controls if the Rendering Parameters are set to display the
        vortex particles.  Turning on point display may be required to
        see the points.
    Source:
        Determines how the vorticles are created.

        Box:
            The vorticles are seeded uniformly in the box specified
            by the center and size.
        Geometry:
            The given geometry's points are converted into vorticles.

    Size:
        The size of the bounding box in which to seed vorticles.
    Center:
        The center of the bounding box in which to seed vorticles.
    Number Of Vorticles:
        The number of vorticles to create.
    Use Transform:
        Determine of object level transforms of the specified geometry
        should be taken into account.
    Geometry:
        A path to a SOP geometry to use as vorticles.
    Magnitude:
        The amount of vorticle force to apply on each vorticle.  This
        is applied to the mag point attribute.
    Radius:
        The radius of influence for each paddlewheel-like force.  This
        is applied to the pscale point attribute.
    Up Vector Type:
        How to compute the up vector for each vorticle.  The up vector
        is used as the axis around which the paddlewheel applies its
        force.  The up point attribute is used here.

        Unchanged:
            The incoming up vector is used.
        Random:
            Each vorticle receives a random up vector.
        Manual:
            The specific up vector value is applied to each vorticle.
    Random Seed:
        Changes what distribution is used for scattering the points in
        the box or for initializing the up vectors.
    Data Name:
        The name of the data to create.
