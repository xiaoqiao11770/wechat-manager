= Null =

""" Does nothing. """

The Null DOP passes through the objects, data, or relationships that
are wired into it unchanged. It can be used as a placeholder to refer to
a specific part of a DOP simulation. It can also be used to re-route
wires in a more aesthetically pleasing fashion. Finally, it can be used
as a generator of a stream of no objects, no data, or no relationships.

For example, to switch between no data and a specific piece of data, a
Null DOP could be wired first into a Switch DOP, allowing the selection
of 0 to mean nothing.
