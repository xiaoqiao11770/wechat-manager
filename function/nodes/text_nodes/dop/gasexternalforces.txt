"""A microsolver that evaluates the external DOPs forces for each point
in a velocity field and updates the velocity field accordingly."""

The Gas External Forces DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas External Forces DOP evaluates the DOPs forces for each point in
a velocity field. It then updates the velocity field according to those
force values. Each voxel's mass is assigned a value of 1 for force
calculation. The torque is ignored.

The Gas External Forces DOP can also evaluate DOPs forces for each
point in a particle system.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to update with the external forces.
    Geometry:
	Geometry subdat to apply the external forces to the points of.
    Point Group:
	An optional point group to specify which points will have forces
	computed.
    Forces to Apply:
        Which DOP Force Data will be evaluated.  This could be a list
        of forces or a pattern, such as *, to match all forces.
    Surface Field:
        An SDF which represents the inside and outside of the object.
        Forces will only be applied on the inside of the surface.
    Density Field:
        A 0-1 density field that represents the amount of "substance"
        in each voxel.
    Scale Surface Field:
        The amount of force applied to a voxel will be scaled by an
        estimation of how much of that voxel is inside the surface.
        Alternatively, if this is disabled, force will only be applied
        if the surface value of the voxel is inside.
    Scale Particle Forces:
        When applying the forces to geometry, one can use the
        mass value of the particles stored in the mass attribute, the
        density value stored in the density attribute, or ignore the
        particle mass altogether.
    Scale Density Field:
        The amount of force is scaled by the value in the density
        field.  This causes voxels which contain substance to be
        affected by the force and empty voxels to be unaffected.
    Compute New Particle Velocities:
        When applied to geometry, one can either directly integrate the
        velocity by the force (as is done in the field case) or instead
        just update the force attribute.
    Stable Drag:
	When taking large timesteps there is the risk that drag forces
	will overshoot zero, causing the fluid to start moving in the
	opposite direction of its initial speed.  Stable drag will
	compute the jacobian of the forces to try to avoid this
	overshoot, at a cost when performing drag forces.
