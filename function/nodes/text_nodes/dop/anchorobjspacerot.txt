= Anchor: Object Space Rotation =

"""Defines an orientation by specifying a rotation in the space of some simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Space Rotation belongs to a class of DOP nodes that
define position or orientation values for use in building constraints.
This anchor defines an orientation by specifying a rotation in the space
of some simulation object.


@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Initialize With World Space Rotation:
	#channels: /useworldspacerotation
	Turning on this parameter causes this anchor to calculate a value for
	the __Rotation__ based on the supplied __World Space Rotation__.
        
	To do this, the anchor finds a __Rotation__ that will produce the
	__World Space Rotation__ when combined with the orientation of the
	object.
    World Space Rotation:
        #channels: /worldspacerotationx /worldspacerotationy /worldspacerotationz

	When the __Initialize With World Space Rotation__ parameter is turned
	on, this value specifies the world space orientation used when finding
	the __Rotation__.
    Rotation:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Specifies a rotation that is combined with the orientation of
        the object to calculate the orientation of this anchor.
