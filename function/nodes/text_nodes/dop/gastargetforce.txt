"""A microsolver that applies a force towards a target object."""

The Gas Target Force DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Target Force DOP builds a force field that directs smoke
towards a target shape.  It does this by building a Signed Distance
field out of the target smoke, using 0.5 as the cut off surface.  A
force is then applied to the smoke, proportional to the density, in
the direction of this target.

When the shape is reached the inward pointing force will be canceled
out by hydrostatic pressure.

@parameters

== Force ==
    Force Scale:
	How strongly the force is applied.
    Use Existing Goal Field:
	Instead of building a goal field from the target relationship of this
	object, an existing scalar field will be used.  The name used defaults
	to goal and is set in the __Fields__ tab.
    Animated Goal:
	If not set, the vector force field of the goal is only
	built on the first frame.  This saves a lot of work if the
	goal field isn't animated.
    Liquid Mode:
	When set the __Density Field__ and __Goal Field__ are both treated
	as signed distance fields.  The force is no longer scaled by
	the density field and no expansion term is applied to the
	positive error.  These changes are appropriate for liquid
	simulations.
    Soft Target:
	If set no signed distance field is computed.  Instead, an
	error field is built.  This error field is used as a goal
	divergence in computing the desired force vectors.  This
	allows the matching of grey scale fields rather than just the
	0.5 cutoff of a fog surface.
    Normalize Error:
	When the __Density Field__ closely matches the __Goal Field__ the
	error, and hence magnitude of the forces, decreases.
	Normalizing the error tries to preserve the total force to help
	the convergence feel constant.
    Force Blurring:
	When in hard-target mode, this is the radius to blur the gradient field
	with.  A blurred gradient avoids harsh discontinuities where smoke is
	pulled in opposite directions, resulting in a smoother separation when
	topology changes.
    Minimum/Maximum Goal Distance:
	Controls the range that the goal distance ramp operates on.
	The minimum goal distance refers to the left side of the ramp,
	the maximum the right side.  Negative values imply inside the
	goal object.
    Map Goal Distance to Force:
	Scales the force according to how far from the goal object it
	is.  This can be used to disable the suction effect at a
	far distance, or to cut off the inward force once the smoke
	reaches the goal.

== Guides ==

    Each of the fields that cotnrol the smoke attraction can be
    visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the [Scalar Field
    Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] provides more
    details about how these work.

== Fields ==
    These parameters control what name will be used for the input
    fields and the internal fields.

    Density Field:
	The smoke field to drive to the goal shape.  The force is
	scaled by this field.
    Goal Field:
	The target shape.  The 0.5 contour is used as the goal
	perimeter.
    Goal SDF:
	An SDF version of the target shape built from the 0.5
	contour of the goal.
    Goal Force Field:
	A vector field pointing towards the goal field.  This is
	what is used for the force.
    Velocity Field:
	The vector field to add the force to.
    Collision Field:
	The scalar field to use as a collision hint when soft
	target is enabled.  The generated force field will know to
	avoid the collision objects so specified.
