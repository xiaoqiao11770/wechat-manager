= Active Value =

"""Marks a simulation object as active or passive."""

An active object is one which is controlled by a solver and
can be affected by other objects. A passive object, even if it has a
solver attached to it, is never modified by the solver. It may still
affect other objects, but is not affected by those objects. This value
can also be animated to make an object switch between these two states.

Keyframe animating RBD objects is easier with the RBD Keyframe Active
DOP. This node combines an Active Value DOP with other nodes to allow
the position to be animated along with the active state.


@parameters
    Active:
        #channels: /active

        Controls whether the object is active or passive. A value
        greater than or equal to one indicates an active object. A value
        less then one indicates a passive object.
