"""A microsolver that adjusts an SDF according to surface markers."""

The Gas Correct By Markers DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Correct By Markers DOP takes a group of particles that
represent the surface of a field and uses them to correct a signed
distance field. This allows one to better preserve high resolution
features even with a coarse grid.

@parameters

Surface:
    The signed distance field that the surfels will correct. Each
    surfel will determine if they are on the right side of this
    field. 

    If they are on the wrong side, they will update the field
    to make themselves on the correct side. The surfels will then
    have their own radii updated to represent their new correct
    distances to the surface.
    
Surfels:
    The geometry that represents the surface of the SDF. Each point
    has a `size`, `pscale`, and a color, `Cd`. 

    The color is used to flag
    the particle as an inside or outside particle - a red value less
    than 0.5 means an outside particle, greater than 0.5 means an
    inside particle. The `pscale` governs how far from the correct
    surface the particle is.
