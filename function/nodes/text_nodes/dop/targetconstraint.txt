= Target Constraint =

"""Constrains a soft body object to a target trajectory using a hard constraint or soft constraint."""

This involves constraining a set of points on the soft body object 
(wire or cloth) to a target trajectory, specified by point/vertex attributes `targetP` and `targetv`.

SBD Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

== Constraint ==

Type:
    #channels: /type

    Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint.

Constrained Object:

    #channels: /group

    The soft body object to be constrained.
Constrained Points:
    #channels: /ptgroup

== Soft Controls ==

Stiffness:
    #channels: /stiffness

    This determines how strongly the soft constraint matches the target positions.

Damping:
    #channels: /damping

    This determines how strongly the soft constraint matches the target velocities.

== Guide Options ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.
Radius:
    #channels: /guiderad

    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.
Color:
    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

    Controls the color of the guide geometry if using pin constraints.
Show Object Link:
    #channels: /showobjectlink

    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
