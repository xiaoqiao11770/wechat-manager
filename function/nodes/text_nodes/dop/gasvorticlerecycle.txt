"""A DOP node that recycles vorticles by moving them to the opposite
side of the fluid box when they leave."""

The Gas Vorticle Recycle DOP is a node that recycles vorticles by
teleporting them across a fluid bounding box.

This microsolver is best attached to the advection stage of a smoke
solver.  The size and center should be tied to the size and center of
the fluid bounding box.
