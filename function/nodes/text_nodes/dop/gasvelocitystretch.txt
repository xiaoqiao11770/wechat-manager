"""A microsolver that reorients geometry according to motion of a
velocity field."""

The Gas Velocity Stretch DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Velocity Stretch DOP reorients vorticles according to the local
motion of the velocity field. A velocity field that rotates a vector
around an axis non-parallel to its direction will not move the origin
of the vector, but should precess the direction of the vector. This
DOP performs this rotation.

The name of the DOP is because the rotation is done by applying the
stretching motion of the velocity field and then renormalizing the
resulting vorticle.


@parameters
    Field:
        List of fields to be stretched by the velocity.  __Scalar__ fields
        will have their values scaled by the squash/stretch of the
        velocity field.  __Vector__ fields will have their lengths
        preserved but be rotated by the field.  __Matrix__ fields will use
        the Scale and Rotate Transform options to determine which
        operations will occur
    Geometry:
        List of geometry data which will be stretched by the velocity
        field.
    Point Group:
	An optional point group to specify which points will be stretched.
	Note that all primitives, such as spheres, will still be stretched
	even if their point is not specified here.
    Attributes:
        The list of point attributes to stretch.  Attributes of 3
        components will be rotated and have their lengths preserved.
        Attributes of 4 components will be treated as quaternions and
        rotated.  Attributes of 1 component will be treated as scales
        and be adjusted by the overall squash/stretch of the velocity
        field.
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to use to rotate the geometry and fields. This
        must be a vector field.  The gradient of this field defines a
        local rotation, squash, and stretch.
    Scale Primitive Transforms:
        Perform non-uniform squash/stretch of spheres, metaballs, 
        volumes, or matrix fields.
    Rotate Primitive Transforms:
        Rigidly rotate spheres, metaballs, volumes, or matrix
        fields by the velocity field.
