= Anchor: Object Point Number Position =

"""Defines a position by looking at the position of a point on the geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Number Position belongs to a class of DOP
nodes that define position or orientation values for use in building
constraints. This anchor defines a position by looking at the position
of a point on the geometry of a simulation object. The point to use is
specified by its point number.


@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Geometry:
	    #channels: /geometry

	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the point position.
    Initialize With World Space Position:
        Turning on this parameter causes this anchor to calculate a
        value for the __Point Id__ based on the supplied __World Space
        Position__. 
        
        To do this, the anchor finds the point on the geometry
        that is closest to the supplied __World Space Position__. The point
        number of that closest point is then used as the __Point Number__
        value.
    World Space Position:
        #channels: /worldspaceposx /worldspaceposy /worldspaceposz

        When the __Initialize With World Space Position__ parameter is
        turned on, this value specifies the world space position used to
        find the closest point.
    Point Number:
        #channels: /pointnum

        Identifies the point on the geometry to used to calculate the
        anchor position.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

        Specifies an offset in object space from the geometry point
        position.
