"""A microsolver that resizes a fluid to match another object."""

The Gas Resize Fluid DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Resize Fluid DOP will resize the fields required for different
types of fluid simulations according to a reference size.  This
resizing is done with the Gas Resize Field DOP so does not affect the
actual voxel sampling, just the total number of voxels.  This can be
used have the fluid box track a moving object.

@parameters
Fluid Type:
    The type of fluid controls what sort of fields need to be resized.

    DSD Fire:
        The following fields are resized in __DSD Fire__ mode: `heat`, `burn`, `collision`, `collisionvel`, `confinement`, `d`, `ddot`, `density`, `divergence`, `dt`, `flamefront`, `fuel`, `fuelvolume`, `kappa`, `kappastar`, `pressure`, `pump`, `pumpindex`, `rest`, `sink`, `source`, `sourceindex`, `temperature`, and `vel`.

    Smoke and Pyro:
        The following fields are resized in __Smoke and Pyro__ mode: `collision`, `collisionvel`, `density`, `divergence`, `pressure`, `pump`, `pumpindex`, `rest`, `rest2`, `sink`, `source`, `sourceindex`, `temperature`, `vel`, `burn`, `fuel`, and `heat`.

    Fluid:
        The following fields are resized in __Fluid__ mode: `collision`, `collisionvel`, `surface`, `pressure`, `pump`, `pumpindex`, `rest`, `sink`, `source`, `sourceindex`, `temperature`, and `vel`.

Extra Fields:
    Any additional fields, such as those you have added with a [Scalar Field DOP|Node:dop/scalarfield], can be listed here to ensure they are also resized.
    
Reference Object:
    An object node.  The geometry of the object will be imported in and a bounding box calculated and used as the fluid bounds.
    
Dynamic Object:
    A DOP object in the same simulation as this object.  Its geometry will be used to compute a bounding box. This is used if __Reference Object__ is specified.
My Data:
    Geometry data attached to this object can be used as the source for the bounding box size. This is used if __Dynamic Object__ or __Reference Object__ specified.
    
Size, Center:
    An explicit bounding box to resize to.  This can be animated to have a changing bounding box over time.  Not used if any of the other methods are specified.
    
Lower/Upper Bound:
    The bounding box is expanded by this amount.  The amount is positive for expansion, so a 1 in lower bound will increase the size of the bounding box in the negative direction by one.

Voxels:
    The number of voxels to grow the bounding box by.  This is dependent on the resolution of the underlying fields.
