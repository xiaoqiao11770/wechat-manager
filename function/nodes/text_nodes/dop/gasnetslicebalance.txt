"""A microsolver that balances slices data between multiple machines."""

The Gas Net Slice Balance DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Net Slice Balance DOP balances the slice positions between
multiple machines.  It requires that the particle system was sliced
using Slice Along Line.

@parameters
    Geometry:
	The particle system to do the slice transfer with.

    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Slice Data Root:
	The root data to build our slice topology from.

    Slice Attribute:
	The attribute that stores which slice is currently owning the
	particle.

    Balance Weight:
	The weighting factor to balance the slice positions so each
	has the same number of particles.

    Time Weight:
	The weighting factor to balance the slice positions so each
	takes the same amount of time to compute.
