= Cone Twist Constraint Relationship =

The Cone Twist Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint DOP|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint.

A Cone Twist Constraint Relationship is similar to a [Hard Constraint
Relationship|Node:dop/hardconrel], but specifies an elliptical cone
within which rotation may take place. The cone is described by
specifying a maximum rotation on each axis.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters
    == Data Options ==

    Max Up Rotation:
        The maximum rotation up or down in degrees.
    Max Out Rotation:
        The maximum rotation from side to side in degrees.
    Max Twist:
        The maximum twist in degrees.
    Softness:
        Once an angle is greater than softness * the maximum
        angle, the constraint begins to take effect. Lowering
        the value of softness softens the constraint boundaries.
    Constraint Force Mixing:
        Increase this to make the constraint spongier, and potentially
        increase the stability of the simulation. The constraint may be
        violated by an amount proportional to the force required to
        re-establish the constraint, times this parameter.
    Bias Factor:
        The rate at which the constraint corrects errors in position or
        orientation. A value of 1 will ensure that the constraint is always
        obeyed. It is recommended to keep bias between 0.2 and 0.5.
    Relaxation Factor:
        The rate at which the angular velocity is changed by the
        constraint. A low value means the constraint will modify
        the velocities slowly, leaving the boundaries appearing
        softer.
    Goal Twist Axis:
        The goal direction of the cone.  Defaults to the X axis.
    Goal Up Axis:
        The goal direction of the up axis. Defaults to the Y axis.
        This should be perpendicular to the twist axis. The out
        axis is calculated as the cross product of the twist
        and up axes.
    Constrained Twist Axis:
        The initial twist axis of the constrained object.
    Constrained Up Axis:
        The initial up axis of the constrained object. This should be
        perpendicular to the constrained twist axis.
