""" Creates position information from an object's transform. """

The OBJ Position DOP creates position information that attached to an
DOP object from an object level transform.
This allows an object level animation to drive an animation at the DOP
level.


@parameters
    Compensate for Geometry Transform:
        Causes the transform information generated by this node to be
        multiplied by the inverse of the transform embedded in the Geometry
        data for the DOP object. 

	This will cause the world space position
        of the DOP object geometry to match the world space position of the
        source scene level object. 

	If this option is off, the world space
        position of the DOP object will be the world space position of the
        source scene level object multiplied by the transform embedded in the
        DOP object geometry data.
    Use Geometry Translation for Pivot:
        Use the translation portion of the Geometry transform as the pivot
        when __Compensate for Geometry Transform__ is enabled.  This will result in transforms are easier to interpolate, especially for rotations, and yield more accurate collision velocities.
    OBJ Path:
        Path to the object from which the positional transform will be
        extracted.
