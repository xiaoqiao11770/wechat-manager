= Enable Solver =

The Enable Solver DOP allows multiple subsolvers to be enabled or disabled
for a group of simulation objects.  There is no individual control over which simulation object is enabled. For individual control use the [Switch Solver DOP|Node:dop/switchsolver].

@parameters
    Enable Solvers:
        #channels: /enable

	Controls if the subsolvers attached will solve or not.  While this can
	be animated, it has per-object local variables so it can't vary on a
	per-object basis.

    Enable on Data When:
	You can disable the incoming solvers if the object does not meet certain data requirements.

	All Data Present:
	    Each space-separated dataname (which maybe itself a wild card match) must match data on the object for it to be solved.
	Any Data Present:
	    If any of the datanames are attached, it will solve.
	All Data Absent:
	    If any of the data names are present, it will not solve.
	Any Data Absent:
	    If each of the space-separated datanames do not resolve to an attached data name, it will solve.
    
    Enable Data:
	A space separated list of data.  These can contain wildcards, but for the purpose of __All Data__ or __Any Data__, each token is considered independently.  Thus, the dataname `foo*` has to match only one data to succeed the __All Data Present__ test.

    Enable on Attrib When:
	Data that resolves to Geometry can be further tested to see if desired attributes are present.  Each attribute is a space separated token which does not support wildcards.

	If a dataname used wildcards to match one than one data, only one of those data have to pass this test for the entire dataname to be considered matched.

	All Attributes Present:
	    All of the listed attributes must be present for the data to be considered a match.
	Any Attribute Present:
	    So long as one of the listed attributes is present, the data is considered a match.
	All Attributes Absent:
	    If any of the listed attributes is present, the data is not considered matched.
	Any Attribute Absent:
	    If each of the attributes is absent, the data is considered matched.
    
    Enable Attrib Class:
	Controls what class of attributes are considered for matching.

    Enable Attributes:
	A space delimited list of attributes to search for to control if the solvers will be enabled.
