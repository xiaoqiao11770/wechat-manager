= SOP Geometry =

The SOP Geometry DOP pulls geometry from a SOP for use in a DOP
simulation. The geometry in the SOP is referenced rather than copied, so
no memory overhead is incurred by referencing geometry from a SOP,
unless the __Primitive Group__ parameter is set in which case that portion
of the geometry must be copied.

@parameters
    Use External SOP:
	Since this node is itself a SOP network, if this toggle isn't
	set the geometry imported will be the display SOP of the
	contained network.

    SOP Path:
        #channels: /soppath

        The SOP from which the geometry data is extracted.
    Primitive Group:
        #channels: /primgroup

        The name of a primitive group within the SOP geometry. If this
        is set, the primitives in that group are copied to make new
        geometry owned by the DOP simulation. Otherwise the SOP geometry
        is referenced rather than copied.
    Time:
        #channels: /time

        Specifies the time at which the SOP is evaluated to extract the
        geometry.
    Use Object Transform:
        Turn on this option to embed the transform from the parent
        object of the SOP along with the geometry.   
    Transform Time:
        #channels: /transformtime

        Specifies the time at which the object transform is evaluated when
        __Use Object Transform__ is enabled.
    Re-evaluate SOPs to Interpolate Geometry:
	Normally when a solver asks for geometry data in a sub-step, the
	simulation will simply linearly interpolate position data from integral
	frames. However, this is not exact. Turning this option on re-evaluates
	the geometry network for each substep. This is more accurate, but can
	be very expensive.
    Number of Stamps:
	By stamping you can generate different geometry for each object
	despite them pointing to the same SOP.  For example, if you
	stamp OBJID with $OBJID, and in your sop have the expression
	`stamp("..", "OBJID", 0)`, you will be able to  process based on the
	object id.

	Note: The SOP cooking is done the first time the geometry is
	accessed from inside of DOPs, not at the time that the SOP Geometry is
	added to the object.

	Note: The scope of the stamp is not the SOP Geometry DOP node, but
	instead the SOP Path node.
