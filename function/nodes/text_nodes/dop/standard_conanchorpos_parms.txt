#type: include
Constraint Type:
    #channels: /condof

    Controls if/how the constrained object can move in reaction to the
    pull of the "goal" (the point to which the object is constrained).

    Free to Move in Any Direction:
        The constraint has no effect.
    Constrained to Plane (Specify Normal):
        The object can move along a plane defined by the goal location
        and the normal you specify in the __Constraint Direction__
        parameter.
    Constrained to Line (Specify Direction):
        The object can move along an axis defined by the goal location
        and the direction you specify in the __Constraint Direction__
        parameter.
    Constrained to Point:
        The object exactly follows the goal.
Constraint Direction:
    #channels: /condirx /condiry /condirz

    When __Constraint Type__ is __Constrained to Plane__, this value
    defines the normal of a plane centered at the goal location.

    When __Constraint Type__ is __Constrained to Line__, this value
    defines the direction of an axis running through the goal location.
