= Fan Force =

"""Applies forces on the objects as if a cone-shaped fan were acting on
them. """

The Fan Force DOP applies forces on objects as if a cone-shaped fan
were acting upon it. The fan has an origin and applies forces radially
from its center. Only points within the cone of influence receive the
forces.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of the node, which adds the noise as subdata of the force data. If you want to maintain the fan's direction despite the noise, turn on __Generate Scalar Noise__ in the [Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise].

@parameters

    == Data Options ==

        Position:
            The origin of the fan. This determines the apex of the cone
            of influence. All forces will be directed away from this
            point.
        Direction:
            The direction in which the fan is pointing. This is used to
            determine the cone of influence's orientation.
        Cone Angle:
            The angle of the fan's cone.
        Falloff Angle:
            The fan's force does not stop instantly at the cone angle,
            but continues for this number of degrees.
        Force Per Unit Area:
            The amount of force to apply per unit of area on the
            destination object. Larger objects thus receive more force
            than smaller objects.
        Falloff:
            The rate at which the fan force falls off with distance.
        Max Distance:
            The maximum distance at which the fan will exert a force.

        Sampling Mode:
            Indicates the preferred sampling level (point, circle, or sphere) to trade accuracy for efficiency of the computation.


    == Guide Options ==

        Show Guide Geometry:
            Turn on this parameter to present a visual representation
            of the fan's location and direction in the viewport.
        Scale:
            Scales the guide geometry to allow a better match between
            the fan size and the size of the simulation objects.
