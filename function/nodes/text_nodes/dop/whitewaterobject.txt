""" Creates a Whitewater Object that holds data for a whitewater simulation. """

The Whitewater Object DOP creates a Whitewater Object inside the DOP
simulation. It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for the 
[Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] to operate.

Color Particles By Type:
	Color the particles by their classification in the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver].
	By default the particle colors are:
	* Green - Spray
	* White - Foam
	* Red  - Bubbles
	* Yellow - Ballistic

The Surface and Velocity fields sourced from the input fluid
simulation can be visualized in a number of ways.  The help for the
[Scalar Field Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] or 
[Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] 
provides more details about how these work.
