= Position =

""" Associates a position and orientation to an object. """

The Position DOP creates position information that can be attached to
an object. Position data is not quite as general as an object transform
because it cannot represent scales.

Position data can also be attached to Geometry data to transform it,
although this is only rarely useful.

NOTE:
    The __Default Operation__ of __Set Initial__ only takes effect if the node is the first node to attach an object of that name/type.

@parameters
    Position:
        Position of the object in world space.
    Pivot:
        Local space position around which rotation is applied.
    Rotation:
        Initial orientation of the object. This is in RX/RY/RZ format.
