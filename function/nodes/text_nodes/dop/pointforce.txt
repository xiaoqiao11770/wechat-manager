= Point Force =

""" Applies a force to an object from a particular location in space.
"""

The Point Force DOP applies a force to an object from a particular
location in space. Because the force may be offset from the center of
mass of the object, the applied force may result in some of the force
being translated into a torque on the object.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of the node, which adds
the noise as subdata of the force data.


@parameters
    Force:
        The magnitude and direction of the force applied to the object.
    Position:
        The simulation space position from which the force is applied.
