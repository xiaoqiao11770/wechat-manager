= Anchor: Object Point Number Rotation =

"""Defines an orientation by looking at a point on the geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Number Rotation belongs to a class of DOP
nodes that define position or orientation values for use in building
constraints. This anchor defines an orientation by looking at a point on
the geometry of a simulation object. The point to use is specified by a
point number.

@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Geometry:
	#channels: /geometry

	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the point position.
    Point Number:
        #channels: /pointnum

        This value is the point number of the point used to calculate
        the orientation.
    Orient Attribute:
        #channels: /orientattribname

        Specifies the name of the quaternion attribute on the geometry
        that is used as the point orientation. If this value is left
        blank, or specifies an attribute that does not exist on the
        geometry, the __Up__ and __Out__ Attributes are used instead.
    Up Attribute:
        #channels: /upattribname

        Specifies the name of the up vector attribute used to calculate
        the orientation of the point if the orient attribute is not
        specified.
    Out Attribute:
        #channels: /outattribname

        Specifies the name of the out (normal) vector attribute used to
        calculate the orientation of the point if the orient attribute
        is not specified.
    Rotation:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        This parameter specifies an offset to the orientation pulled
        from the point attributes.
