"""Adds detail at a certain scale by applying "disturbance" forces to a scalar or vector field."""

The disturbance force introduces small amounts of change, mimicking the effects of localized environmental change. This localized change in momentum cancels itself out over time, preserving the simulation's general motion and overall shape.

This disturb force is modulated by the __Control Field__ and lookup ramps. These control where and at what magnitude the disturb force is applied.


@parameters

Disturb Field:
	The field to apply the disturbance force on.
	
Threshold Field:
	Computes the __Cutoff__ value.
	
Disturbance:
	Amount of localized change to introduce into the simulation. Very high values (greater than 5) might introduce grid artifacts or big (random) changes in motion.
	
Time Scale:
    A scaling factor for time inside this solver. `1` is normal speed, greater than `1` makes the pyro sim appear speeded up, less than `1` makes the pyro sim appear to be in slow motion.
	
Cutoff:
    #id: cutoff
    Ignore voxels with values higher than this in the __Threshold Field__ (density by default, you can change the field on the __Bindings__ tab). This lets you only affect the edges of the smoke.
	
Locality:
    #id: locality
    Number of voxels are sampled into a certain disturbance value. Higher values give larger disturbance elements. Available when __Use block size__ is on.
	
Use Block Size:
    #id: override_block_size
    When this option is on, use the __Block size__ parameter to set the size of disturbance elements in word space units. When this option is off, use __Locality__ to control the size of disturbance elements in voxels. Using block sizes avoids issues if you scale the container.
	
Block Size:
    #id: block_size
    Size in world units of the details added. Higher values give larger disturbance elements. Available when __Use Block Size__ is on.

Use OpenCL:
    #id: opencl
    Selects whether the OpenCL implementation or matching CPU implementation is used.

Use Control Field:
    #id: usecontrol
    Whether the control field is to be used.

Control field:
    #id: control
    When enabled, the force exerted is scaled by the content of this field.

Control influence:
    #id: controlinfluence
    
    A scaling factor on the control field's influence on the effect. A value of `0` makes the field have no influence.

Control min:
    #id: controlmin
    Maps the range to this minimum.

Control max:
    #id: controlmax
    Maps the range to this maximum.
