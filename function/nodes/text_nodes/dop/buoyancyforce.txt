= Buoyancy Force =

"""Applies a uniform force to objects submerged in a fluid."""

Use this operator to approximate the buoyancy force of objects
submerged in a fluid.

A uniform force is applied to every part of the object that is inside
the fluid field.  The field is determined by a [Scalar Field
DOP|Node:dop/scalarfield] connected to the second input.  The scalar
field is interpreted as a signed distance field.  One approach is to
use a [Fetch Data DOP|Node:dop/fetchdata] to copy the surface field of
a fluid simulation.

NOTE:
    Force generated by this operator is applied independently of the object's mass.  Light objects will be affected more than heavy objects.  A default sphere of radius 2 may need a force value of 50000 to overcome the default gravity.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise Field DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of this
node. Noise is added as subdata of the force data.
