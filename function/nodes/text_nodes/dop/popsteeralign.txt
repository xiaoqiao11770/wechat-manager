"""Applies force to agents/particles to align them with neighbors."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter). You can choose whether each agent is "aware" of all the agents within a certain radius, or only the agents in its field of view.
