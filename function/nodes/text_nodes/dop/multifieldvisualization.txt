"""Unified visualization of multiple fields."""

The Multi Field Visualization DOP visualizes multiple field data.
The resulting visualization can both combine and ramp fields to gain
a quick preview of rendering behavior.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry should be visualized at all.
    Color:
        The color to use in visualization.  The iso surface or smoke
        field will be colored with this color.
    Bounding Box:
        Draws a bounding box encompassing the field.
    Bounding Box Hash:
        Adds hash marks along the axes leaving the origin of the
        bounding box marking the divisions between each voxel.  The
        hash marks are drawn larger for every tenth and every
        hundredth.

    Minimum, Maximum:
	This is the range of the density volume that will be remapped into the
	0..1 range.  It also acts as the default range for all the other volumes
	unless the override is specified.
    Density Scale:
	Fixed multiplier to the density field to control how opaque the volume
	is.  If you are using a larger scene scale, you may need a smaller
	density scale.

        NOTE:
            Fog density is density per unit, and is independent of the resolution. So the same sized box, at 100 or 10 divisions, should be the same opacity. This means very small boxes will become transparent, especially if HDR rendering isn't on. You can enable HDR rendering on the __Effects__ tab of the [Display Options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] dialog.
    Shadow Scale:
	An additional multiplier on the __Density Field__, applied after the density
	scale, when the volume is used for lighting.  This is the equivalent of
	multiplying the shadow intensity of all the lights by this value.
    Max Vis Res:
	By default volumes are restricted to a maximum of 128 voxels on each
	side.  This ensures reasonably fast shading times for lighting and
	avoids running into texture memory problems.  This parameter lets you
	override this, either to make a lower res volume for faster
	previsualization, or to allow the volume to render with full
	resolution.

    Field:
	The name of the field to use for this operation.

	If this is a color field (diffuse, emission color), then if a scalar
	field is specified it is treated as a monochromatic field.  If it
	it is a vector field, they are tied to the red, green, and blue
	channels.
    Range:
	Each field can have its own mapping range.  The volume will be linearly
	remapped from this range into the 0..1 range.
    Mode:
	Controls the use of the ramp.  If set to __No Ramp__, the volume's values
	are used unclamped and unaffected by the ramp.  __Clamped Ramp__ will clamp
	the volume's values to the 0..1 range and then apply the ramp.
	__Perioidic Ramp__ will take the modulus of the volume's values with 1 and
	send that to the ramp, which can be useful to create checkerboard or
	striped effect to better see large ranges of values.
    Ramp:
	The volume's values, after converting by the range specification, are
	looked up in the ramp to get the final value.  If it is a color ramp
	then there is one volume bound. That volume's value is looked up to
	get the color.  If two or three volumes are bound, each volume in turn
	is looked up to get the red, green, and blue values independently.
