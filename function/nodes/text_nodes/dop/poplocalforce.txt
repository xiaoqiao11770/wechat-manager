= POP Local Force =

"""A POP node that applies forces within the particle's frame."""

The POP Local Force node applies a force to a particle.  It does this within the particle's own facing, as determined by the `orient` attribute.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

    == Parameters ==

	Thrust:
	    Force in the direction the particle is facing.
	Lift:
	    Force in the particle's up direction.  This is based off the `orient` attribute, not the `up` attribute.
	Side Slip:
	    Force in the side-ways direction of the particle.
