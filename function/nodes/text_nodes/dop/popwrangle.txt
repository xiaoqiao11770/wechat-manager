"""Runs a VEX snippet to modify particles."""

== Overview ==

This is a very powerful, low-level node that lets experts who are familiar with VEX tweak particles using code.

This node corresponds to the [POP VOP DOP|Node:dop/popvop], but uses a textual VEX snippet instead of a VOP network.

WARNING:
    This node requires that you understand the [vex language|/vex]. It is very easy to write incorrect code using this node.

This node runs the snippet on the detail or every point in the input geometry.
The snippet can edit the input geometry by changing attributes.
It can access information from other geometry using attributes and VEX functions.

* Press ((MMB)) on the node to see any error output from the snippet.

* You can use the VEX function `ch` to evaluate parameters.
  The path is relative to this node (`ch("parm")` will evaluate the parameter `parm` on this node).
  This evaluation will be done at the current time.

* Unlike the [Attrib Create SOP|Node:sop/attribcreate], this does not use local variables.
  Further, all backtick expressions and `$F` variables will be evaluated at frame 1,
  not the current time.
  Use `@Frame`, `@Time`, or `@TimeInc` instead.

== Context ==

This node runs the snippet in the *CVEX context*.

    Attributes to Create:
	Only create attributes if their names match this pattern.
	The default pattern allows any attribute to be created.
	
	You can restrict the created attributes by replacing the `*` with a list of allowed names.

	Bound attributes, such as `vtxnum`, cannot be created and will be ignored.

    Enforce Prototypes:
	Automatic binding with the `@` syntax can be convenient, but if your
	system becomes more complex there is the risk that a typo in an `@` binding
	will silently just bind a non-existent attribute.

	This option forces all `@` bindings to be explicitly declared as
	prototypes before use.

    [Include:standard_gas_timestep]

== Data Bindings ==
    Geometry:
	The list of the geometry on the object to process.

    Evaluation Node Path:
	VEX functions like `ch()` usually evaluate with respect to this node. Providing a path here can override where the path search starts from.  This is useful for embedding in a digital asset where you would like the top level digital asset to be the search root.

    Export Parameters:
	When a VEX parameter is exported, the bound attribute will be created if it doesn't exist.  This pattern can be used to override the export option on the VEX shader to avoid writing to or creating certain attributes.  The pattern matches the VEX parameter, not the bound attribute.  The attribute will still be bound for reading.

    Autobind by Name:
	Will use the name of the attribute to determine which attribute binds with which parameter.  

	Integer attributes will bind to integer parameters.  Float attributes will bind to float, vector, point, matrix, or matrix4 depending on their tuple size.  String attributes will bind to strings.

    Attribute Name, VEX Parameter:
	Manually specifies the bindings of each attribute.  

    Field Name, VEX Parameter:
	Optionally binds Scalar, Vector, Matrix, or Index fields from this object to the CVEX function.  They will be sampled at the current `P` location of each element.

	You can then access these with the `@` syntax referring to the given Parameter.
    Autobind Groups by Name:
	Automatically bind any groups to the integer parameter prefixed with `group_`.
    Group Name, VEX Parameter:
	Manually specifies the bindings of each group.

    Update Normals If Displaced:
	If points are being run over, and the `P` attribute is written to,
	but the `N` attribute is not written to, any incoming normals will
	become out of date.  When this option is set, vertex and point
	normals will be updated when this occurs.


== Inputs ==

    Input 1, 2, 3, 4:
	These control the four virtual inputs accessible inside of VOPs.

	They can be accessed with the OpInput1-4 wires from the VOP, or with the `@OpInput1-4` string parameters when using VEXpressions.

	They can also be accessed numerically as 0-3 with VEX functions that take an input number.

	None:
	    No geometry is wired to this input.
	SOP:
	    The SOP geometry will be cooked prior to running the VEX and the result wired to this input.
	DOP Data:
	    Data in the current simulation to reference.  Specified as
	    an object/data, for example, `pyro1/vel` to refer to the velocity
	    field of the `pyro1` object (which will show up as three volume
	    primitives).
	Myself:
	    Referring to the geometry currently being processed is special as you have to ensure a copy is made so the VEX functions can refer to its original form.  This handles that for you.
	Nth Context Geometry:
	    These refer to the SOPs wired into the parent DOP Network itself.
	Myself (No Reads from Outputs):
	    Refers the currently processed geometry.  Does not make a copy
	    so it is up to the user to ensure no reads are made from
	    any attributes that are bound.
    SOP Path:
	Path to a SOP to wire in.
    DOP Data:
	Object/data path a piece of DOP data in THIS simulation to wire in.
