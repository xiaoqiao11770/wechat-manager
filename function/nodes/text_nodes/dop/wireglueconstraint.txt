= Wire Glue Constraint =

"""Constraints a wire point to a certain position and direction."""

This involves constraining some point on the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] to a "goal" location and orientation derived from animation on the Wire Object's
geometry, another simulation object or from a position and orientation
in world space.

This node is useful when simulating hair or fur by letting you animate
the roots of the hairs in the source geometry and have the simulated wires
created from them follow along.

@parameters
    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrained Points:
            #channels: /ptgroup

            Identifies the points in the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrain To Internal Animation:
            #channels: /useanimation

            Constrains points to animation present on the input geometry.  
            
            The __Use Deforming Geometry__ parameter on the constrained Wire Object's
            node should be enabled to make the animation available to the DOP
            simulation.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an wire object used to determine the goal
            position. 
            
            If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Goal Points:
            #channels: /goalpts

            Identifies the points in the goal object to use for the goal
            location.  The goal points are paired with the constrained 
	    points in the order in which they are given.

	    If there are more constrained points than goal points, the 
	    "leftover" points are constrained to the last specified goal
	    point.  "Leftover" goal points will not be used.

            If no points are specified, the initial position of
            the constrained point should be used.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space to which the wire object
            will be constrained.
        Constrain Position:
            #channels: /constrainposition

            Causes spatial constraints to be created for each specified
            point.
        Constrain Rotation:
            #channels: /constrainrotation

            Causes rotational constraints to be created for each
            specified point.
        Goal Rotation:
            #channels: /goalrotation

            Specifies the goal rotation for the constrained wire object.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be made
            mutual affectors.
