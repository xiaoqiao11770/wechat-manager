= Gas Each Data Solver =

"""A microsolver that runs once for each matching data."""

The Gas Each Data Solver DOP is a microsolver used in
building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The gas each data solver will run the solvers attached to it multiple times,
once for each time that data in the object matches the __Data to Solve__.  Each
time it runs, the next matching data will be renamed to __Solve Data Name__.  After
solving, the renamed data will be moved back to its original name.

This allows one to apply a sequence of operations to multiple fields, working
one field at a time, allowing you to share temporary fields.

@parameters
    Data to Solve:
	The name of data to match. This can contain space delimited data names,
	or wild card matching with `*`.  The input solvers will be run once for
	every matching data.

    Solve Data Name:
	The matching data on each run will be renamed to this name, allowing
	the upstream solvers to know what data to look for.

    Copy Data:
	By default the data is renamed, so if it is modified by the input
	solvers, no extra copies need to be made.  But this poses a problem if
	the input solvers expect to be able to refer to the original data by
	its original name.  If __Copy Data__ is set, the data is copied to the
	__Solve Data Name__ rather than moved.

    Split Fields:
	When Matrix and Vector fields are encountered, rather than
	being renamed, they are split into their component scalar fields.
	The subsolvers are then run once for each scalar field.  This
	can reduce peak memory usage and improve cache locality.
