"""A microsolver that computes analytic property of fields."""

The Gas Analysis DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users can attempt to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Analysis DOP computes various analytic properties of the input field to produce the output field.  The nature of these properties mean that the output isn't always the same type as the input - a gradient computation on a scalar field yields a vector field, for example.

The length is calculated by measuring the slope of increasing values. For example, if temperature rises faster over a shorter distance, it will create a bigger gradient. If temperature is a height field, then gradient length is how steep the hill is.

@parameters

Dest Field:
    The list of fields to store the result.  They must be the
    right type to match the corresponding source field.  The type
    depends on the calculation.

Source Field:
    The list of fields to use as the source for the analysis.

Analysis:
    The types of analysis that can be performed.

    Curvature:
        Source and destination should be same type.  Each
        component of the source field has its curvature
        computed and stored in the corresponding component of
        the destination field.

    Gradient:
        Destination should be one dimension higher than the
        source: the gradient of a scalar is vector, and gradient
        of vector is a matrix.  The simple case of a scalar
        field results in a vector field which points in the
        direction of increasing scalar values.

    Laplacian:
        Source and destination should be the same type.
        The divergence of the gradient is computed for each
        component and applied to the destination.

    Divergence:
        Destination should be one dimension lower than the
        source: the divergence of a vector is a scalar. The simple
        case of a vector field results in a scalar field that
        stores the amount of compression/rarefication in the
        vector field.

    Curl:
        Curl is only available for vector->vector
        computations.  It outputs a vector that lies in the
        axis of rotation of the field and has magnitude
        proportional to the field's rotation speed at that
        point.  Curl is also known as rot.

    Normalize:
        Available for vector->vector computations, the
        destination is set to the source after normalizing the
        length of the source vector.

    Length:
        Available for vector->scalar and matrix->scalar computations,
        the scalar field is set to the length of the vector field at
        each location.  The euclidean norm is used for both vector
        and matrix lengths.
