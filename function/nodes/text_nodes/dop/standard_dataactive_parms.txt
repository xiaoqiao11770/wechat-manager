    Determines if this node should do anything on a given timestep and
    for a particular object. If this parameter is an expression, it is
    evaluated for each object (even if data sharing is turned on). 
    
    If it evaluates to a non-zero value, then the data is attached to that
    object. If it evaluates to zero, no data is attached, and data
    previously attached by this node is removed.
