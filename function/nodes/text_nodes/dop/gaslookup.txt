"""A microsolver that looksup field values according to a position
field."""

The Gas Lookup DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Lookup DOP uses a position field to look up values inside the
source field.  The result is saved in the destination field.

@parameters
    Destination Field:
        The list of fields to save the result of the lookups into.
        This can be a space separated or globbed list. __Scalar__, __Vector__, and __Matrix__ fields can all be targets of the lookup.

    Position Field:
	A single vector field which specifies the location each point
	should get its values from.  Each voxel of the destination
	field will look into this field to find what position should
	be used to lookup into the source field.
    Source Field:
        The list of fields to save the result of the lookups into.
        This can be a space separated or globbed list. __Scalar__, __Vector__, and __Matrix__ fields can all be targets of the lookup.
	These fields must match the destination fields in type, but
	not necessarily in size or resolution.
