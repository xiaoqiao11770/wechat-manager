#type: include

Activation:
    #id: activate
    
	When this is off, the node will have no effect. You can animate this to turn the behavior on or off at different times.
    
Group:
    #id: partgroup
    
	Only modify a certain group or groups out of all agents/particles. You can name groups of agents using the __Group name__ parameter on the [Crowd Source geometry node|Node:sop/crowdsource].
    
Output Attribute:
    #id: output
    
    If you are working with agents, set this to "Crowds steerforce". If you are working with particles, set this to "POP force".
    
    This controls whether the node modifies the agent's `steerforce` attribute (used by the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver]) or the particle's `force` attribute (used by the [POP solver|Node:dop/popsolver]).
    
Weight:
    #id: weight
    
	Available when __Output attribute__ is "Crowd steerforce". This number is used by the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver] to normalize and scale multiple forces that apply to an agent.
