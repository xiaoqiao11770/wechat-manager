"""Apply forces on objects using a force field defined by metaballs.
"""

The Magnet Force DOP apply forces on objects using [metaballs|Node:sop/metaball] to
represent a force field. The force applied to an object is in the
direction of the gradient of the metaball field. Positive force scales
will apply forces into the metaball field, negative force scales will
apply forces outwards from the metaball field. No torque is applied.

The geometry to generate the force field should be attached to this
force as subdata. Only the metaballs in this geometry are used.

    == Data Options ==

        Scale Force:
            The amount of force applied is proportional to the density
            of the metaball field at that point multiplied by the Scale
            Force parameter. 

            Because metaballs are represented
            geometrically as having surfaces at a density of 1, the
            force scale lets the good geometric representation to be
            used by adding a constant multiplier.

        Sampling Mode:
            Indicates the preferred sampling level (point, circle, or sphere) to trade accuracy for efficiency of the computation.

    == Guide Options ==

        Show Guide Geometry:
            When turned on, the metaball force field is displayed.
