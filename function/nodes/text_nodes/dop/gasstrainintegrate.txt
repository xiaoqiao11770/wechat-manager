"""A microsolver that updates the strain field according to the current
velocity field."""

The Gas Strain Integrate DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Strain Integrate DOP updates a strain field according to the
given velocity field. The shears present in the velocity field are used
to compute the strain it imparts and this is added to the strain field.
The strain field itself is slowly relaxed over time to simulate plastic
flow.


@parameters
    Strain:
        A matrix field that stores the total accumulated strain in each
        voxel. The strain is a measure of the distortion that the fluid
        in the voxel has undergone.
    Surface:
        A signed distance field that determines the inside of the
        fluid, and hence where the strain should be integrated. Voxels
        outside the fluid are considered to have zero strain and to be
        able to immediately relieve any pent up strain.
    Velocity Field:
        A vector field providing the current velocity of the fluid.
        While rigidly moving fluid has no strain, other areas where
        fluid flows unequally from voxel to voxel represents non-rigid
        distortion an hence strain.
    Alpha:
        This is the rate of plastic flow. The current strain is
        dissipated at this rate per second. A value greater than the
        timestep per second can lead to overshoot.
    Gamma:
        This is the threshold for plastic flow. When the norm of the
        strain exceeds gamma, the strain is dissipated according to the
        alpha term. This causes the fluid to lose its history and
        permamently enter its new configuration.
