= Script Solver =

The Script Solver DOP runs an HScript command as the solve step for the
objects to which it is attached. Usually this command will source an
external script file. This script can run any HScript commands, in
addition to a few commands that can only be run from within a Script
Solver. These special commands and expressions all begin with the prefix
"dopsolve", and can be found in the See Also section.

The Code Snippet mode allows you to use Python to define the solve
stage.  The parameter gather stage will automatically copy any spare
parameters of this node onto the solve data, allowing you to fetch
them during the solve.

@parameters
    Use Code Snippet:
	Rather than loading from a script solver, define python code
	for the solver directly.
    Solve Script:
        #channels: /script
	The script command to run when initializing new DOP objects or
	when actually solving for all the objects using this solver.  New
	objects are returned by the [dopsolvenewobject|Exp:dopsolvenewobject]
	function, and you may want to set up these objects for solving on
	subsequent frames.

	The objects to solve are returned by
	[dopsolveobject|Exp:dopsolveobject], and do not include the objects
	returned by [dopsolvenewobject|Exp:dopsolvenewobject].  The script will
	usually perform the important work on these objects.  This work may
	include moving or otherwise altering the objects, creating new data by
	tabulating existing data on the objects, and so on.
    Python Snippet:
	Defines the python code that is run during the solve pass.  Unlike
	Python Solver node types, or the Solve Script, this does not
	include code for executing during the parameter evaluation
	pass of this node.  Instead, the standard python boilerplate is
	used, allowing one to focus only on what happens during solve.
