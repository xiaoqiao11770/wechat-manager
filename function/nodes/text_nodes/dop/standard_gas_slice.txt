Slice:
    Which slice to use.  Should be a number between 0 and the number of slices - 1.
Slice Divisions:
    Number of pieces to cut the volume into along each axis.  The total number of pieces, or slices, created will be the product of these numbers.  Ie, 2, 3, 4 will create 24 slices.
Overlap Voxels Negative, Positive:
    Adds a padding on the lower/upper side of the slices.  The slices start by dividing space evenly, but then this overlap will cause them to overlap with their neighbors.  The field exchange nodes use this overlap to determine what is communicated.
