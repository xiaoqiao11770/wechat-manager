"""A microsolver that changes the size of fields. """

The Gas Resize Field DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Resize Field DOP will adjust the field's bounding boxes to be the
closest match to the desired center and size that will keep the same voxel
size and keep the voxels aligned.  A reference field can be specified, in
which case that field will be used as the destination size.

By applying this to the simulation space between solves, it is
possible to track moving fluid without having to create a field as big
as the total possible fluid volume.

Note:
    The specified Size and Center will override the padding variables.  If the
    combination is set to Intersects, the resulting field will be clamped by
    those sizes/center values.

@parameters
    Field:
        The field to resize. This can be a scalar, vector, matrix
        or index field. It can be a space delimited list of fields or
        a glob pattern.
    Reference:
        The field to match.  Note that an exact match may not be
        obtained if the voxel sizes or parities do not match in the
        original field.  This can also be geometry in which case the
	bounding box of the geometry is used as reference.
    Reference Point Group:
	If the reference is a geometry, this optionally will specify which
	points in that geometry to use for the reference.  If a point group is
	specified, a point bounding box is computed, so the extents of
	primitives like spheres will not be included.
    Combine Fixed Field:
	Controls how the reference field will be combined with
	explicit field given by the bounding box parameters.
	Intersect can be used to clamp the maximum field size, and
	union to ensure certain key areas are always simulated.
    Size:
        The dimensions to resize the field to.  The closest size that
        fits an integer number of voxels will be chosen.
    Center:
        The new center of the field.  The center will only be adjusted
        in full voxel increments to ensure the fields are aligned.
    Combine Original Field:
	Controls how the field created by the reference and fixed
	fields will be combined with the original field.  This can be
	used to make the field only grow over time, for example.
    Lower/Upper Bound:
	The bounding box is expanded by this amount.  The amount is
	positive for expansion, so a 1 in lower bound will increase
	the size of the bounding box in the negative direction by one.
    Voxels:
	The number of voxels to grow the bounding box by.  This is
	dependent on the resolution of the underlying fields.
    Keep Data:
	By default, the data of the old field will be clipped/extended into the
	new field size.  However, if this field is going to be overwritten,
	a performance increase does not require the data to be kept.
	The data is left in an undefined state. For example, the data will likely be retained if the field didn't change size.
