= Data Only Once =

""" Adds a data only once to an object, regardless of number of wires. """

The Data Only Once DOP will apply the input data or solvers to wherever it is wired to.  However, it will only do so for the first valid wiring in each substep.  This allows a solver or data to be wired into many different locations without getting many copies of the node.

This is most useful for microsolvers that initialize values; any node that wants the solver to have executed can wire in, and only the first node will actually trigger the solving of the only once's inputs.

If this is disabled, it acts like a merge and always adds all of the input data.

NOTE:
    Substep refers to DOP level substeps when the network is evaluated,
    not the substeps within DOP solvers.

@parameters

@inputs
    All:
        The objects or solvers coming into the input specified by the
        are passed through to the single output.  This only occurs
	for the first valid wiring.
@outputs
    First:
        The objects or solvers coming into the input are passed to the
	output if this is the first time in this substep that this
	node has cooked.
