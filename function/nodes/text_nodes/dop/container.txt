= Container =

The Container DOP allows you to create a "folder" of data on an object.
This node has no behavior of its own, or any direct effect on a
simulation object. But in situations where several data of the same type
can be attached to an object (such as forces or constraints), this node
can be used to organize those data into a single location.

When the Data Name of a DOP node contains a "/" character (such as
"Forces/Gravity" on the Gravity DOP), the portion before the "/" will
automatically result in a Container data being created to hold the real
data. So in many cases, an explicit Container DOP node is not required.
However it may be easier to create and organize data visually in the DOP
Network if the creation of the Container data is explicit.
