= POP Kill =

"""A POP node that kills particles."""

The POP Kill node marks particles for deletion.  They will then be deleted in the final stage of the POP Solver.  This means they will not be visible on the next frame, but they will be available to later nodes for, for example, birthing particles from.

This operator modifies the `dead` attribute.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Rule ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the rule is active.
	VEXpression:
	    A local expression providing a rule for setting up which particle should be killed.
	    The `dead` variable should be assigned 1 if the particle should be killed.

    == Bounding ==

	Enable:
	    Controls if the particles will be killed by a bounding region.
	
	Bounding Type:
	    The shape of the bounding region.

	    Bounding Box:
		A box of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Sphere:
		A sphere of the given dimensions.
	    Bounding Object:
		Whether the point is inside the given object.
	    Bounding Volume:
		The object's volume primitive is used to determine if
		the point is inside.
	Center:
	    Center of the bounding primitive.
	Size:
	    Size of the bounding primitive.  This is a diameter, not radius.
	SOP Path:
	    Path to the bounding object.
	Iso Surface:
	    What volume value to threshold between inside and outside.
	Invert:
	    Inverts the sense of inside and outside for killing. This is particularly useful with the volume bounding option and switching between a fog volume and an SDF volume.

    == Random ==
	Enable:
	    Controls if the rule is active.
	Behavior:
	    When particles pass the chance test, they will either be added to the list to be killed, or removed from it, according to this test.

	    Setting to remove allows you to remove points that are added by the previous folders of the kill test.
	Chance:
	    The probability that any particle will pass this test.
	    `0` means no particles will pass, `1` means all will pass.
	Seed:
	    The random seed used for grouping points.  The `id` attribute is added to this implicitly.

    == Bindings ==
