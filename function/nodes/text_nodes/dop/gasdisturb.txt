"""Adds detail at a certain scale by applying "disturbance" forces to a scalar or vector field."""

The disturbance force introduces small amounts of change, mimicking the effects of localized environmental change. This localized change in momentum cancels itself out over time, preserving the simulation's general motion and overall shape.

This disturb force is modulated by the __Control Field__ and lookup ramps. These controls where and at what magnitude the disturb force is applied.

TIP:
    The default __Disturb field__ (on the __Bindings__ tab) is `temperature`, which influences the velocity indirectly. For a more direct transfer of energy, set __Disturb field__ to `velocity`.

@parameters

Time Scale:
    A scaling factor for time inside this solver. `1` is normal speed, greater than `1` makes the pyro sim appear to be sped up, less than `1` makes the pyro sim appear to be in slow motion.
	
	You can use expression functions such as [Exp:doptime], [Exp:dopframe],[Exp:dopsttot], and [Exp:dopttost] to convert between global times and simulation times.

== Disturb Settings ==

Disturbance:
	Amount of localized change to introduce into the simulation. Very high values (greater than 5) might introduce grid artifacts or big (random) changes in motion.
	
Cutoff:
    #id: cutoff
    Ignore voxels with values higher than this in the "threshold field" (density by default, you can change the field on the __Bindings__ tab). This lets you only affect the edges of the smoke.
	
Use Block Size:
    #id: override_block_size
    When this option is on, use the __Block size__ parameter to set the size of disturbance elements in word space units. When this option is off, use __Locality__ to control the size of disturbance elements in voxels. Using block sizes avoids issues if you scale the container.
	
Block Size:
    #id: block_size
    Size in world units of the details added. Higher values give larger disturbance elements. Available when __Use block size__ is on.
	
Locality:
    #id: locality
    Number of voxels are sampled into a certain disturbance value. Higher values give larger disturbance elements. Available when __Use block size__ is off.

== Bindings ==

Disturb Field is Vector Field:
	Enable this parameter when the field to disturb is of a type Vector.
	
Disturb Field:
	The field to apply the disturbance force on.
	
Threshold Field:
	This field is used to compute the __Cutoff__ value.
