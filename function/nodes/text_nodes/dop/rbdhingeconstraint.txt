= RBD Hinge Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to two constraints, creating a rotation similar
to a hinge or a trapeze bar."""

This involves constraining some location on the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to a "goal" location derived from another simulation object or from a position in
world space.

RBD Hinge Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the RBD object to be constrained.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an RBD object used to determine the goal
            position. If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Constrained Location:
            #channels: /objectposx /objectposy /objectposz

            Specifies a location in world space which is used to
            calculate values for the local object space position of the
            constraint. 
            
            The goal position parameters are also set up
            using this position.
        Constraint Direction:
            #channels: /condirx /condiry /condirz

            Specifies a direction in world space which is used to
            initialize the orientation the hinge constraint.
        Length:
            #channels: /length

            Specifies the distance between the two ends of the hinge.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.
