"""A microsolver that removes the divergent components of a velocity
field using a multi-grid method."""

The Gas Project Non Divergent Multigrid DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that
allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to
extend or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Project Non Divergent Multigrid DOP removes any divergent portions of a
velocity field. These are parts of the velocity field that represent
expansion or contraction. This is done by computing a pressure field
that counteracts any compression or rarefication and applying that
pressure field instantaneously.

This differs from Gas Project Non Divergent DOP in that it does not support
collisions or free surfaces.  It is also much faster.  The lack of
collision support can be worked around by explicitly zeroing out the collision
velocity values and repeating the projection.

NOTE:
    The [Curl Noise POP|Node:pop/curlnoise] is often used with this node in FLIP fluid simulations, because it plays very predictably with any fluid simulations that contain the Gas Project Non Divergent Multigrid DOP.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The velocity field to make divergence free. This must be a
        vector field.

    Goal Divergence Field:
        While the purpose of this micro solver is to remove
        divergence, one may want instead to make a field match a
        certain divergence pattern.  

	The goal divergence field is a
        scalar field which will be matched.  If not specified, a zero
        field is used, thereby having the equivalent of no-divergence.
        The field is scaled by the surface area of the voxels so can
        be specified independently of the resolution of the actual gas
        geometry.

        NOTE:
            Gas Advection micro solver relies on the field
            being non-divergent. Divergent fields may be inconsistent and
            not exhibit the proper rarefication/compression of scalar
            fields.  One can add in the rarefication/compression step by
            using a Gas Velocity Stretch micro solver on the density field
            using the modified velocity field as a reference.
    Pressure Field:
        The pressure required to make the velocity field divergence
        free is output into this field.
    Relative Tolerance:
	When the error in the initial velocity field is reduced to this
	fraction of its original error, the operation will stop.  Higher values
	will leave the velocity field with divergence still present.
    Absolute Tolerance:
	If the velocity field is already almost non-divergent, a relative error
	can be very hard to achieve.  Thus the absolute tolerance marks a total
	error in the velocity field at which point the solver will stop.
    Min Iterations:
	The minimum number of multigrid iterations before the solver will stop.
	More iterations provide more accuracy, but it is probably better to
	adjust the tolerance if that is needed.
    Max Iterations:
	The maximum number of multigrid iterations.  The solver will stop at
	this point even if the error tolerance are not reached.
    Use OpenCL:
	Will attempt to use the OpenCL driver on the system to perform the
	projection.  If the driver is not setup, or runs out of memory, will
	fail.
