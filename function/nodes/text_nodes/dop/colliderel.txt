= Collide Relationship =

The Collide Relationship DOP is used to describe a collision relationship
between two sets of objects. A collider subdata can be attached to the second
input of this node. This collider subdata specifies the actual collision
detection algorithm that should be used to detect collisions between the
objects in this relationship. If no collider subdata is attached, then the
Collider Label for the objects is used to automatically determine what the
best collision detection algorithm is.

Collision relationships can also be created using a [Merge DOP|Node:dop/merge]
or turning on the Make Objects Mutual Affectors toggle on solver nodes.

@parameters
    Collider Priority:
        If there are multiple collide relationships that specify different
        collision detection methods between a pair of objects, this Collider
        Priority parameter is used to determine which relationship takes
        priority. The collider data attached to the collide relationship with
        the highest priority value is used.
