= Soft Attach Constraint Relationship =

The Spring Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint
relationship data types. These constraint relationships are attached as
subdata to a [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to control the
relationship between the Anchor nodes attached to the Constraint. 

In a Soft Attach Constraint Relationship, the solver applies forces in an
attempt to make the Anchor values equal. It is the soft counterpart of a Hard Constraint. The amount of force exerted is related to the distance between the Anchors.

@parameters

== Data Options ==

    Stiffness:
        #channels: /stiffness

        The strength of the force that attempts to match the positions of the two anchors.

    Damping:
        #channels: /damping

        The strength of the force that attempts to match the velocities of the two anchors.

== Guide Options ==

    Radius:
        #channels: /rad

        The radius of the sphere that appears at the
        constraint anchor positions in the viewport as guide
        geometry. 
        
        Whether or not to display the guide geometry
        depends on the [Constraint|Node:dop/constraint] node to
        which this relationship is attached.
    Color:
        #channels: /colorr /colorg /colorb

        The color of the constraint guide geometry.
    Show Object Link:
        This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
        connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
