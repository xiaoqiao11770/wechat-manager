= POP Limit =

"""A POP node that limits particles."""

The POP Limit node limits particles within a cube in 3d space.  This is useful to automatically cull or bounce particles that fly too far.

This operator modifies the `P`, and `v` attributes.

@parameters
[Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

== Behavior ==
Pos Behavior:
    How to treat out-of-bound points.  

    Clamp:
	Set the point position to lie on the boundary.
	
    Bounce:
	Reflect the point position around the boundary.  If a point escapes
	by 0.5 units, place it 0.5 units on the inside of the boundary.
	This conserves the motion of the escaping particle and avoids
	having all the particles gaining the same location.
    Wrap:
	A point leaving the right boundary by a distance of 0.1 will be
	moved to 0.1 to the right of the left boundary.

Kill Outside Open Boundaries:
    Delete any particles outside an open boundary.

Vel Attribute:
    The point attribute to use for velocity operations. The velocity will 
    only be affected if it is in the direction of the boundary. On escaping
    the +X boundary, the velocity will only change if it is positive in the X
    direction, not if it is negative. This is to allow the particles to freely
    separate from the boundaries.

Vel Behavior:
    How to correct the velocities when they are pointing the wrong way and a
    point has escaped.

    None:
	Perform no velocity correction.
	
    Clamp:
	Set the component of the velocity to zero if it lies in the
	collision direction.
	
    Bounce:
	Negate the component of the velocity if it lies in the collision direction.

Center:
    The center of the limit box.

Size:
    The size of the limit box.

Use Reference's Closure:
    If the reference field is a velocity field, then its close x/y/z settings will be used rather than the following parameters.

    If there is no reference, or it is not a velocity field, the parameters will be used.

Closed Ends:
    Determines what, if any, of the boxes boundaries will be applied.  These parameters are designed to match those on the [Vector Field DOP|Node:dop/vectorfield].

    X, Y, Z:
	When closed ends is set, these select which sides will be closed.
