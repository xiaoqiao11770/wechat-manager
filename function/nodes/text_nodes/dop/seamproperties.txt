= Seam Properties =

"""Defines the internal seam angle."""

The Seam Properties DOP controls the rest angle along seams (connections between primitives belonging to separate panels) for a [cloth object|Node:dop/clothobject]. This is used in the paneling workflow.

The rest angle along edges between two primitives belonging to separate panels. Panels are connected by pinning together two pieces of cloth or changing the rest positions of vertices in a cloth so that two vertices belonging to the same point do not have the same position.
