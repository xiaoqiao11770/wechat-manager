Solver Per Object:
    The default behavior for solvers is to attach the exact same solver to all
    of the objects specified in the group.  This allows the objects to be
    processed in a single pass by the solver, since the parameters are identical
    for each object.  However, some objects operate more logically on a single
    object at a time.  In these cases, one may want to use `$OBJID` expressions
    to vary the solver parameters across the objects.  Setting this toggle will
    create a separate solver per object, allowing `$OBJID` to vary as expected.
