"""Apply forces to agents/particles to create a random motion."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

This node has a __Force__ parameter, which controls the base speed of the wander, and __Amplitude__, which controls the size of the _changes_ to the base speed. So, for example, high __Force__ and low __Amplitude__ would give fast motion with small deviations, while low __Force__ and high __Amplitude__ would give overall slower motion but with big swings in direction and speed.

@parameters

Force:
	Base strength of the wander force.

Amplitude:.
	Size of the random changes to __Force__.
    
Swirl Size	
	Size of the noise pattern.
    
Swirl Scale

Roughness	
	Scale of noise added with each iteration.
    
Attenuation
