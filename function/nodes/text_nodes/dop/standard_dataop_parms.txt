Parameter Operations:
    Each data option parameter has an associated menu which specifies
    how that parameter operates.

    Use Default :
        Use the value from the Default Operation menu.
    Set Initial :
        Set the value of this parameter only when this data is created.
        On all subsequent timesteps, the value of this parameter is not
        altered. This is useful for setting up initial conditions like
        position and velocity.
    Set Always :
        Always set the value of this parameter. This is useful when
        specific keyframed values are required over time. This could be
        used to keyframe the position of an object over time, or to
        cause the geometry from a SOP to be refetched at each timestep
        if the geometry is deforming. 
        
        You can also use this setting in
        conjunction with the local variables for a parameter value to
        modify a value over time. For example, in the X Position, an
        expression like `$tx + 0.1` would cause the object to
        move 0.1 units to the right on each timestep.
    Set Never :
        Do not ever set the value of this parameter. This option is most
        useful when using this node to modify an existing piece of data
        connected through the first input. 
        
        For example, an [RBD State
        DOP|Node:dop/rbdstate] may want to animate just the mass of an
        object, and nothing else. The __Set Never__ option could be used
        on all parameters except for __Mass__, which would use __Set
        Always__.
        
Default Operation:
    For any parameters with their __Operation__ menu set to __Use
    Default__, this parameter controls what operation is used. 
    
    This
    parameter has the same menu options and meanings as the __Parameter
    Operations__ menus, but without the __Use Default__ choice.
