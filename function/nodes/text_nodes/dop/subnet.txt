= Subnetwork =

The SubNetwork DOP acts as a container for other DOP Nodes. It performs
no action itself, other than to connect its inputs and outputs to the
correct locations on the contained nodes.

The outputs of a SubNetwork DOP are always set to match the outputs of
the contained DOP node with its display flag turned on. The input colors
and hints will match the colors and hints from the contained DOP nodes
to which the numbered indirect inputs are connected.
