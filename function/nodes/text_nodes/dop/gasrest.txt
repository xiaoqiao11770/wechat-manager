"""A microsolver that initializes a rest field."""

The Gas Rest DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Rest DOP computes a the position of each point in the voxel
grid and stores it in the grid, creating a rest field.

@parameters
    Dest Field:
        The vector field to store the rest positions in.

    Enable Rest Extrapolation:
	The vector field's border conditions will be set to
	extrapolate.  Also, the correct local transform for the voxels
	will be computed and stored.  This allows advection, resizing,
	and other operators that have to pull from beyond the boundary
	of the rest field to read extrapolated values rather than the
	streaked values.
