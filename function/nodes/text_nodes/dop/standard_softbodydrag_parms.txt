Normal Drag:
    #channels: /normaldrag

    The component of drag in the directions normal to the surface.  Increasing this will make the object go along with any wind that blows against it. For realistic wind interaction, the Normal Drag should be chosen larger (about 10 times larger) than the tangent drag.

Tangent Drag:
    #channels: /tangentdrag

    The component of drag in the direction tangent to the surface.  Increasing
    this will make the object go along with any wind that blows tangent to the
    object.

External Velocity Field:
    #channels: /externalvelocityfield

    The name of the external velocity fields on affectors that the object will
    respond to. The default is `vel`, which will make the object react to fluids
    and smoke when the __Tangent Drag__ and the __Normal Drag__ have been
    chosen sufficiently large. The __Tangent Drag__ and __Normal Drag__ forces
    are computed by comparing the object's velocity with the external velocity.

External Velocity Offset:
    #channels: /externalvelocityoffset

    This offset is added to any velocity that's read from the velocity field.
    When there's no velocity field, then the offset can be used to create a
    wind force which has constant velocity everywhere. This wind effect is
    more realistic and more accurate than the wind that is generated by DOP
    Forces.
