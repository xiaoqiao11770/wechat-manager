= Squishy Object =

"""The Squishy Object DOP converts a geometry object into a dynamic object that
behaves like a soft body in the DOP environment."""

Essentially, it converts the geometry points into particles with sufficient
tension between them to prevent the geometry from losing its shape under the
influence of DOP forces. The resulting squishy body is ready for use by the POP
Solver.

This operator is a superset of the POP Object DOP.

TIP:
    To avoid clamping, try increasing DOP substepping.

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini
        frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  The
        latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the
        DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The
        object is created only when the current frame number is equal to
        this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a
        timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be
        created. 
        
        For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the
        __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to
        `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame
        3.5.
    Object Name:
        The name for the created object.  This is the name that shows up
        in the details view and is used to reference this particular
        object externally.  
        
        While it is possible to have many objects with the same name, this complicates writing references, so it is recommended to use something like `$OBJID` in the name.
    Initial Geometry:
        #channels: /initial_geo

        The path to a SOP which will be used as the initial state for
        the [POP Object|Node:dop/popobject]. If the specified SOP contains geometry other
        than particles, the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] can be configured to
        automatically convert these other primitives into particle
        systems.
    Use Deforming Geometry:
	#channels: /animategeo

	Lets the software know whether to watch for geometry whose shape
	changes (or might change) before being brought into the DOP
	simulation. Expect faster performance when this toggle is off.
	
    Use Object Transform:
        Specifies whether or not the transform of the object containing
        the __Initial Geometry__ should be embedded in the Geometry
        data.

    == Collisions ==

        Tolerance:
            #channels: /tol

            When colliding with the surface of another object, this
            tolerance value is used by the ray intersection code. 
            
            Any time a point gets within this distance of the surface it is
            counted as a collision.
        Volume Offset:
            #channels: /volumeoffset

            When colliding points against a Volume representation, the
            surface of the Volume is effectively pushed out by this
            amount. 
            
            Like the __Tolerance__ value above, it causes a
            collision to be generated if a point comes within this
            distance of the real Volume.

    == Physical ==

        Bounce:
            #channels: /bounce

            The elasticity of the particles. If two objects of bounce
            1.0 collide, they will rebound without losing energy. If two
            objects of bounce 0.0 collide, they will come to a
            standstill. If the particles have a point attribute called
            `bounce`, that point attribute value overrides this value.
        Friction:
            #channels: /friction

            The coefficient of friction of the particles. A value of 0
            means the object is frictionless. 
            
            This governs how much the
            tangential velocity is affected by collisions and resting
            contacts. If the particles have a point attribute called
            `friction`, that point attribute value overrides this value.
        Dynamic Friction Scale:
            #channels: /dynamicfriction

            An object sliding may have a lower friction coefficient
            than an object at rest. This is the scale factor that
            relates the two. It is not a friction coefficient, but a
            scale between zero and one. 
            
            A value of one means that dynamic friction is equal to static friction. A scale of zero means that as soon as static friction is overcome the
            object acts without friction. If the particles have a point
            attribute called `friction`, that point attribute value
            overrides this value.

    == Softbody ==

        Restoration Strength:
            #channels: /restoration

            Controls how quickly the points will move to their rest
            positions. A low value will only slowly try to restore the rest
            shape, while a large enough value makes the object almost rigid.

            This is the multiplier to move the points towards their goal
            positions in a single step. Higher numbers will result in a
            faster restoration of the base state. Note that values greater
            than the frame rate will be clamped to ensure stability.

        Squash Resistance:
            #channels: /squash

            Controls how much the group of points will be restored from
            squashing effects. Lower values let the object become squashed
            into a pancake, while higher values will always try to keep the
            object in its original dimensions. In any case, volume is
            preserved by applying a stretch to the non-squashed direction.

            In addition to purely rigid transforms, the shape matching may
            also discard squash/stretch transforms. The Squash Resistance is
            the amount to restore the goal to a rigid state in one second.
            Again, it is clamped to the frame rate.

        Frame Drag Strength:
            #channels: /squash
            Acts as a damping effect on the simulation.

            The restoration of the goal shape uses spring-like forces. This
            would result in oscillation of displaced points. The Frame Drag
            will apply a drag force with respect to how they are not obeying
            rigid motion. This cancels out these oscillations without
            slowing the entire object down.
