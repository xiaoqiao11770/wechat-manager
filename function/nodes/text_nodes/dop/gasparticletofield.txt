"""A microsolver that copies a particle system's point attribute into a
field."""

The Gas Particle to Field DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Particle to Field DOP copies a point attribute value from a
particle system into a field.


@parameters
    Destination Field:
        This is the field that the result of the calculation will be
        applied to. It should be the same dimension as the particle
        attribute.
    Particles:
        The geometry whose point attributes will be copied to the
        destination field.
    Particle Group:
        An optional point group to specify the points whose attributes will be copied.
    Use Attribute:
	If a point attribute isn't used as the source, each point will
	be treated as if it had a point attribute with value of 1.
    Attribute:
        The name of the point attribute that will be copied to the
        destination field.
    Accumulated:
        If accumulation mode is set each particle will only affect the
        eight voxels whose centers that it is closest to. A trilinear
        interpolation will be done to scale the particle's value for
        each of those voxels according to how close the particle is to
        the center of the voxel. 

	When used with the Add calculation
        method, this has the advantage of preserving the total value of
        the particle attributes.
    Extrapolated:
        If a voxel cell is outside of the radius of any particles it
        will use the value of the nearest particle. Extrapolation can be
        expensive when performed far away from dense particle sets.
    Use Max Extrapolate Cells:
        Determines if extrapolation should be capped at a certain
        number of voxel cells from the particles. This allows one to
        fill holes in the particle data without having to extrapolate
        for the entire voxel volume.
    Max Extrapolation Cells:
        The number of cells to extrapolate. This value is multiplied by
        the maximum cell dimension and used as a distance cap for how
        far away from the particle system that extrapolation should
        occur.
    Use Max Extrapolate Distance:
        Determines if extrapolation should be capped at a certain
	distance from the particles. This allows one to fill holes in
	the particle data without having to extrapolate for the entire
	voxel volume.
    Max Extrapolation Distance:
        The distance extrapolate.  The maximum of the cell
	extrapolation and the raw distance extrapolation is used as
	the extrapolation cap.
    Threshold:
        The total weight contributed by particles to the cell are
        normalized if it is greater than the threshold. If the weight is
        less than the threshold, the particle attribute values will not
        be normalized and hence drop to zero.
    Bandwidth:
        This value is only used if extrapolation is turned off. The
        bandwidth is specified in cells, so the value is multiplied by
        the largest cell dimension. 

	All particles have their effective
        radii increased by the bandwidth value. This can ensure small
        radius particles are always sampled in a resolution independent
        manner.
    Assume Uniform Radius:
        All particles are assumed to have the same uniform radius as the first particle, and internally a faster algorithm can be used for spatial lookup that scales well to millions of input points.
    Extrapolation Index:
        An index field containing point numbers whose values can be used for extrapolation when Assume Uniform Radius is enabled. This field can be useful for extrapolating values from particles with small uniform radius that might not overlap the sample position, especially in the case of Face or Edge sampled fields. If used in conjunction with a [Gas Particle to SDF DOP|Node:dop/gasparticletosdf] that operated on a center-sampled field (as in the FLIP Solver, for example), the output from that nodes __Surface Index__ parameter can be supplied here to ensure no individual particles are missed when extrapolating.
    Use Angular Momentum:
        Use attributes created by the __Preserve Angular Momentum__ option on the
        [GasFieldToParticle|Node:dop/gasfieldtoparticle] DOP to preserve angular momentum
        when transferring particle velocities to the field.

        NOTE:
            With this parameter enabled, the radius used for transferring particle values
            is always set to the voxel size, not the particle's `pscale` attribute.
    Angular Momentum Prefix:
        The attribute storing the angular momentum for each axis is retrieved from a vector attribute
        named with the specified prefix.
    Scale by Voxel Volume:
        Scales the particle's value by the inverse of the destination
        field's voxel volume.  

	This is most useful in the Accumulated
        mode where it ensures a particle will add the same number
        total units to the field regardless of field resolution -
        higher resolution fields will merely receive a denser
        allocation.
