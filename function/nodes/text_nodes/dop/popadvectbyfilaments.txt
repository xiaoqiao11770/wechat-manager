"""Uses vortex filaments to move particles."""

This node swirls particles around [vortex filaments|/dopparticles/filaments].
The [Source Filaments|Node:dop/sourcefilaments] imports filament geometry into the network.
The [Filament Solver|Node:dop/filamentsolver] advects the points of the filament curves to create motion.
This node then uses the velocity field created by the moving vortex filaments to move particles.

See the [filaments page|/dopparticles/filaments] for more information.

This node modifies the `force`, `airresist`, `targetv`, `vel`, and `P` attributes.

== Parameters ==

Filament Source:
    The source of the vortex filament curves.  The context geometry refer to the inputs of this DOP Network.

SOP:
    The SOP path which contains the vortex filament curves.

DOP Object:
    The name of a DOP Object in the same simulation as this.

DOP Data:
    The sub-data path for the geometry in the DOP object.

Velocity Scale:
    A uniform scale to apply to the velocity field defined by the vortex filaments before any of the force applications.

Advection Type:
    There are several different ways to update a particle system in response to an external velocity field.  They are broadly categorized as Force, Velocity, and Position updates.

    Update Force:
        Adjusts the acceleration of the particles according to the force scale and the velocity field.  This acts like the [Force POP|Node:dop/popforce].

    Update Velocity:
        Directly changes the velocity of the particles by blending in the velocity field, causing them to swiftly match the velocity field.

    Update Position:
        Directly moves the particle positions. This is useful as it allows the particles own velocity to be considered independently of the bulk fluid velocity. This is similar to what the [Gas Advect DOP|Node:dop/gasadvect] would perform.

[Include:standard_pop_parms#treataswindParms/]

Force Scale:
    Scales the force when __Treat as Wind__ is disabled.

[Include:standard_pop_parms#airresistanceParms/]

Velocity Blend:
    In __Update Velocity__ mode, the amount to mix in the field velocity every timestep.

Velocity Update:
    In __Update Position__ mode it is possible to read in the velocity from the velocity field.  
    
    NOTE:
        The resulting velocity will be used by the particle integrator, so unless something special is done, this could result in double-moving the particle.
