= Gas Fetch Fields to Embed =

"""A data node that fetches the fields needed to embed one fluid in
another."""

The Gas Fetch Fields to Embed DOP takes the extra fields needed by Gas
Embed Fluid DOP from another object and attaches them to this object.

@parameters
    Source Object:
	The object to fetch the required fields from.
    Data Prefix:
	A unique prefix for all of the fetched data.  This has to
	match the prefix used by the Gas Emed Fluid Dop.
    Source Type:
	Depending on the type of fluid fetched, different fields are
	needed.  This determines which fields need to be fetched and
	how they should be applied.
