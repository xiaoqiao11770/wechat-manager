= Wire Object =

"""Creates a Wire Object from SOP Geometry."""

The Wire Object DOP creates a Wire Object inside the DOP simulation. It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a
properly conforming Wire Object.

The SOP geometry used to define wire objects are expected to contain a set
of curves.  These curves may be closed curves (eg. polygons) and will be
connected if multiple curves share a common point.  This lets wire objects
describe structures such as ropes, trees, bridges, and spider webs.

== Attributes ==

You can [create attributes|/model/attributes]  on the wire object's
RestGeometry to influence its behavior. Most of these attributes allow
fine-tuning of the wire by scaling values set in this node. Point,
primitive, or detail attributes of the same name will be used if the
vertex attributes are not present.

TIP:
    Mass is distributed to the points of a wire object according to the width and length of each segment.

    Both the __Mass__ and __Density__ parameters let you adjust the total mass of the object. __Density__ is the default method, since it lets you have consistent behavior regardless of the volume of wires you give it. For example, if you make a wire twice as long, it will become twice as heavy. 

TIP:
    The default value of 1000 is the density of water. Try a lighter value, such as 600 for hair.

TIP:
    There is no bounciness parameter on wires. However, an external force could be applied to mimic bounciness.

@outputs
    First:
        The wire object created by this node is sent through the single
        output.
