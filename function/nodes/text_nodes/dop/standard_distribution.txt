Tracker Address:
    What machine will run the simtracker.py process for synchronization.
    If this is blank, there will be no attempt at synchronization or data transfer.
Tracker Port:
    The port specified when starting the simtracker.py process for
    communication.
Job Name:
    The job name to describe this synchronization or data exchange
    event.  By using different job names one can have machines part of
    separate data-exchange and synchronization events.
Slice/Peer:
    The slice number that this machine should report itself as.  Each
    machine connecting under the job name should have its own unique
    slice number.  Sometimes this can be inferred from the operation
    so this parameter will be absent.
Number of Slice/Number of Peers:
    Total number of machines that have to synchronize.  Sometimes this
    can be determined from the operation, so this parameter will be
    absent.
