"""A microsolver that combines multiple fields or attributes together."""

The Gas Linear Combination DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Linear Combination DOP provides a simple way to quickly combine
multiple fields or geometry attributes together.

@parameters
Destination:
    The field or attribute to store the result of the operation in.
    This can be the same as one of the source fields.

Geometry:
    If blank, the destination and source parameters refer to fields.  If set,
    they refer to attributes on this specified geometry.
Create Missing Attribute:
    If the point attribute does not exist, a point attribute of
    the size of the largest of the source attributes will be created.

Point Group:
    An optional point group to specify which points will be transformed.

Combine Operation:
    How to combine the different values together.  The result is `coef_1 * val_1 OP coef_2 * val_2 OP coef_3 * val_3 OP constant`, where OP is this combination operation.

Source 1:
    The first source value.

Coefficient 1:
    A multiplicative coefficient to scale the first source value by.  This can
    also be dynamically scaled by timestep or voxel size using the drop down
    menus.

Source 2:
    The second source value.

Coefficient 2:
    A multiplicative coefficient to scale the second source value by.  This can
    also be dynamically scaled by timestep or voxel size using the drop down
    menus.

Source 3:
    The third source value.

Coefficient 3:
    A multiplicative coefficient to scale the third source value by.  This can
    also be dynamically scaled by timestep or voxel size using the drop down
    menus.

Additional Constant:
    If set, an additional constant term is added to the equation.  This is
    useful for applying a fixed bias to the whole computation.

Constant:
    The fixed constant to combine into the equation as the final operation.

Total Coefficient:
    After the final value is computed, and prior to storing into the
    destination attribute or field, it is scaled by this coefficient.  It can be further adjusted by timestep or voxel size using the drop down menus.
