= Gas Turbulence =

"""Applies Turbulence to the specified velocity field."""

Creates and applies a global turbulence field.  This turbulent velocity field
is modulated by the __Control Field__ and lookup ramps
provided. This controls where and with what magnitude the turbulence shows up, so you can ensure it occurs only in the regions of the sim you want.


@parameters
	Time Scale:
		Specifies a scale factor that relates DOP time to the simulation time for this microsolver. A value greater than one means the simulation time advances faster than the DOP time. A value less than one causes the simulation to appear to run in slow motion relative to the DOP time. Several expression functions such as doptime exist for converting from global times to simulation times and vice versa.
	Scale:
		Magnitude of turbulence applied to specified velocity field.
	Swirl Size:
		Initialized (base) swirl size value. Measured in worl units. This value is derived from frequency, ie: 1/FQ.
	Grain:
		The amount of influence added bands of __Turbulence__ have, relative to the initial __Swirl Size__.
	Pulse Length:
		How fast the noise moves. Higher values will result in slower movement.
	Seed:
		Defines initial noise offset
	Attenuation:
		Defines the gradual loss of intensity.
	Influence Threshold:
		When to apply __Turbulence__, based on the specified __Density Field__.
	Turbulence:
		Levels of turbulence to apply relative to the the initial __Swirl Size__
		For smoother transitions, use lower values.

== Control Settings ==
	Specifies where __Turbulence__ has any influence and to what degree. 

	Control Field:
		When enabled, the force is scaled by the field specified.
	Control Influence:
		How much influence the __Control Field__ has on the previously calculated force.
		A value of 0 disables the __Control Field__.
	Control Min Max:
		Remaps (normalizes) the incoming __Control Field__ values based on the specified minimum and maximum. The output is always in a range of 0 to 1.
	Remap Control Field:
		Use the __Control Field Ramp__ to remap the control field's (normalized) values.
        
== Visualization ==
    For all visualization options, refer to the [Scalar Field Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] and [Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] node help.
    
== Bindings and Temporary Fields ==
    Clear Temporary Fields:
	    Zeros the temporary fields when finished to reduce memory usage.
    Force Velocity Field:
	    The name of the temporary fields to store intermediate steps needed. These will be created with a [Gas Match Field|Node:dop/gasmatchfield] so it does not need to exist ahead of time.
    Velocity Field:
        Used for sampling information from, and apply force to.
    Density Field:
    	Defines when to calculate turbulence. It is controlled through the __Influence Threshold__ parameter.
