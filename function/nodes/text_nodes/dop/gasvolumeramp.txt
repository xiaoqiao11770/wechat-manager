"""Remaps a field according to a ramp."""

The Gas Volume Ramp DOP uses a scalar field as a key to lookup values
in a ramp to write to a destination field.  It can either use a scalar
ramp that ramps a scalar field to a scalar field, or a color ramp to
map to a vector field according to the red, green, and blue values of
the ramp.

@parameters
    Use Vector Ramp:
	Determines if the destination will be a vector field with the
	Vector Ramp being used for mapping, or a regular scalar field
	with the Scalar Ramp used.
    Scalar Dest Field:
	The scalar field to write the result of the mapping operation
	to.
    Vector Dest Field:
	The vector field to write the result of the mapping operation
	to.
    Source Field:
	The scalar field that will be used as a key for looking up the
	ramp values.
    Source Min, Source Max:
	The range of values to map from in the input volume.  Any
	value less than the source min will be clamped to the left
	hand side of the ramp, anything greater than source max to the
	right hand side of the ramp.
    Dest Min, Dest Max:
	The vertical range of the scalar ramp and the color range of
	the vector ramp both default to a 0..1 range.  This allows you
	to remap them to a larger range.  Values in the ramp outside
	of the 0..1 range will be clamped to that range prior to being
	mapped to this new range.
    Scalar Ramp:
	The scalar ramp to use for mapping.
    Vector Ramp:
	The vector ramp to use for mapping.
