"""Visualizes particles."""

The Particle Fluid Visualization DOP visualizes particles.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
	Enables or disables particle visualization.
    Visualization:
	Selects between __Spheres__, __Sprites__, or __Grain__ visualization of
	particles.

	Sphere visualization stamps a scaled sphere at each point.  Sprite will
	stamp a billboarded sprite - but the [Display
	Options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] on the __Particles__ tab have to
	be set to __Sprites__ for this to show up in the viewport.  Grain stamps
	arbitrary geometry on the points.
    Scale:
	This controls the size of the spheres in the guide geometry.  
    Color:
	Controls the color of the visualization geometry.
    Visualization Type:
	Instead of a constant color, one of the particle attributes could be
	visualized.

	None:
	    The color is used for all particles.

	Speed:
	    The length of the attribute is used.  In the case of velocity, this
	    corresponds to the speed.

	Direction:
	    The attribute is normalized to a unit sphere and then scaled to fit
	    into the RGB cube, resulting in a spectrum of colors depending on
	    which way the particle is moving.

	Value:
	    The attribute's raw value is used as the color channels.

    Visualization Mode:
	If the attribute is a scalar attribute, or has been turned into a
	scalar attribute by the Speed visualization type, it can be remapped
	into a color spectrum.

    Visualization Attrib:
	Which point attribute to visualize as color.

    Visualization Scale:
	Before mapping the visualization range, the attribute is multiplied by
	this scale.

    Detect Range:
	The minimum and maximum values of the attribute are computed and used
	for the range.  This allows for automatic bounding of the range.  The
	detail attribute `vis_range` will be set to the computed range.

    Visualization Range:
	This range will be remapped into the 0..1 interval for setting the
	color or mapping by the Visualization Mode.  Using a balanced
	interval, such as -1..1, is useful for detecting zero crossings of an
	attribute along with the Two-Tone visualization mode.

    Sprite SHOP:
	A Sprite SHOP to be used as the shader to draw the particles when in
	__Sprite__ mode.
    Grain SOP:
	A SOP storing the geometry to use for drawing the particles when in
	__Grain__ mode.
