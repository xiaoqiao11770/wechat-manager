"""A microsolver that separates adjacent particles by adjusting
their point positions.."""

When particles get too close together, a common solution is to apply forces to
separate them.  Unfortunately, if you are removing divergence, as in the [FLIP
solver|Node:dop/flipsolver], these forces will be canceled out.  The Gas Particle Separate DOP
takes a different approach by directly adjusting particle positions to keep
them apart.  This also ensures no energy is added to the system directly by the
separating effect.

@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set to separate.

    Particle Group:
        An optional point group to specify which points will be considered.

    Iterations:
	The number of times to perform the separation relaxation step.  This
	value can usually be set to 1 since successive frames of separation
	will have the same effect.

    Update Amount:
	How far to move the particles towards their desired separation
	locations.  This can be reduced to get the effect of a fractional
	iteration.

    Search Scale:
	A scale to apply to all the particle `pscale` values when searching for
	adjacent particles that may be too close.

    Distance Scale:
	A fudge factor to account for the inability for the particles to
	actually pack at the `pscale` amount due to the sphere packing
	problem.  

    Assume Uniform Radius:
        All particles are assumed to have the same uniform radius as the first particle, and internally a faster algorithm can be used for spatial lookup that scales well to millions of input points.
