= POP Wind =

"""A POP node that applies wind to particles."""

The POP Wind node applies wind to particles by updating their `targetv` and `airresist` attributes.

Unlike [POP Force|Node:dop/popforce], which continuously accelerates particles, POP Wind instead acts as a drag pulling particles to the ambient wind speed.

This operator modifies the `targetv`, and `airresist` attributes.

Wind Velocity:
    The direction and magnitude of the ambient wind field.

Air Resistance:
	How much particles are to be influenced by this wind field.
