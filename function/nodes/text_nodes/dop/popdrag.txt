= POP Drag =

"""A POP node that applies drag to particles."""

The POP Drag node defines a drag to particles.

This operator modifies the `targetv` and `airresist` attributes.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==
	Wind Velocity:
	    This is the speed which the particles will be dragged to.

	    If it is zero, they are dragged to a stop.

	    Otherwise, it defines a wind speed which the particles will accelerate to.
