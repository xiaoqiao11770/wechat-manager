= Net Fetch Data =

"""A DOP that transfers arbitrary simulation data between multiple machines."""

The Net Fetch Data DOP exchanges arbitrary data between
machines in a distributed simulation.  It does this during the first
DOP pass when the network is being cooked, not during actual solving
of the simulation.  Often you may prefer the Gas Net Fetch Data if you
need the copying to occur at a certain point in the process.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Source Peer:
	The machine number to fetch data from.  -1 means no fetching
	will be done by this machine (but it may still have others
	fetch from it)

    Source Object:
	The object name, in the source machine, to fetch data from.
	Usually this will match this machine's object names, but if
	different .hip files are different it might get more
	complicated.

    Source Data Name:
	The name of the data to fetch from the source machine.

    Data Name:
	What to call the data after it is copied here.
