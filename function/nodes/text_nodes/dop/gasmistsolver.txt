"""A microsolver that passively moves particles by a velocity field."""

The Gas Mist Solver DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Mist Solver DOP moves particles according to a velocity field.
It also handles aging the particles, killing old particles, and deleting
any particles that go too far into the collision volume.

@parameters

== Parameters ==

Kill Colliding Particles:
    Any particles that go far enough into the collision object will
    be deleted.  This simulates mist being absorbed the by original
    water or wetting surfaces.

Collision Depth:
    Since mist particles are often emitted close to the water, some leeway is
    useful to ensure they are not immediately detected as colliding and
    deleted.

Time Scale:
    The distance the mist particles move through the velocity field is a
    scaled by the timestep and this timescale.

== Bindings ==

Geometry:
    The geometry data that contains the particles.

Point Group:
    A point group within the geometry to move and age.

Velocity Field:
    A vector field to move the particles by.

Collision Field:
    A collision field.  This is only used for the detecting colliding
    particles for deletion.
