= Constraint Network Relationship =

"""Defines a set of constraints based on geometry."""

The constraint network relationship is a low level tool to define constraints
based on geometry.

The [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] should likely be used
instead of building from this node.

__Geometry__ subdata attached to this node will specify the constraint network.
Like all relationships, a solver can be added to run a per frame solver on the
relationship.

@parameters

    Show Guide Geometry:
        Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in
        the viewport representing this constraint.

    Show Object Link:
        This parameter controls the display of guide geometry
        connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
