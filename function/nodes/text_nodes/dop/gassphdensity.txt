"""A microsolver that calculates the density at particle positions in a
particle field using techniques from Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics."""

The Gas SPH Density DOP is a microsolver used to build larger fluid
simulations. It is currently used to compute density in the [Particle
Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. It computes an appropriate value of the density
attribute for each particle in the specified particle geometry.
