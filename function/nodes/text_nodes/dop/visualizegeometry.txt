"""A microsolver to create soft references to visualizers on itself."""

== Overview ==

This microsolver will update the `visualizer` detail attribute to
point to itself.  Thus any visualizers on this node will be used by
the geometry so altered, which often may be well outside of DOPs.

Note that as this is a soft reference, the visualizer settings can change
without recooking or resimulating.  On the other hand, this also means
they do not work outside of the .hip file where they are defined.

@parameters

Clear Previous Visualizers:
    Before adding references to this node, clear the `visualizers` detail attribute.
