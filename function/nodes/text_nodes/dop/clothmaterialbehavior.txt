= Cloth Material Behavior =

"""Defines the internal cloth forces."""

The Cloth Material Behavior DOP controls internal forces for the [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject].
The internal force consists of a potential force and a damping force component.

Each type of stretch, shear, and bend contribution has its own
separate Cloth Material Behavior. There are separate 
Cloth Material Behavior for the two different bend models.
You can control the type of behavior by choosing one of the
following options for the __Data Name__ parameter.

- `SurfaceEdgeStretchBehavior` (stretch in edge directions)
- `SurfaceShearBehavior` (shear)
- `SurfaceWeakBendBehavior` (weak bend)
- `SurfaceStrongBendBehavior` (strong bend).

@parameters
    Stiffness:
        #channels: /stiffness

        This determines the strength of the internal cloth forces
        that oppose deviations from the rest state.

    Damping:
        #channels: /damping
 
        This determines the strength of the internal cloth forces
        that oppose the rate of change of the current state.
        For example, in the case of stretch, the damping force attempts
        to reduce the rate at which the amount of stretch changes over time.
