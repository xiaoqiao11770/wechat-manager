"""A microsolver that calculates the forces imparted by a strain
field."""

The Gas Strain Forces DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Strain Forces DOP uses a strain field to determine what forces
should be applied to mitigate that strain. This acts as a restorative
force to undo the distortion that caused the strain.


@parameters
    Velocity Field:
        The vector field of the velocity that will be updated with the
        effect of the strain calculation.
    Surface:
        A signed distance field that determines which voxels are
        interior to the surface, and hence should be included in the
        strain force calculation.
    Strain:
        A matrix field that has the accumulated strain per voxel.
        Strain is a measure of the distortion that the fluid in the
        voxel has undergone.
    Elastic Modulus:
        Similar to a drag coefficient, the elastic modulus provides the
        scale factor for how to translate a certain amount of distortion
        into a restorative force. 

	A larger value will cause the fluid to
        spring back faster. Large values may require more timesteps to
        keep the simulation stable, however.
