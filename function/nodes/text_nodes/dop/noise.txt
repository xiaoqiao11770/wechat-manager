= Noise Field =

The Noise Field DOP describes a three dimensional noise field. The
noise field can be used to modify forces and torques when attached to
Force data. The value of the noise field at a given location is
multiplied by the amount of force and torque generated by the Force data
at that location.


@parameters
    Random Seed:
        #channels: /seed

        Random seed for the noise.
    Octaves:
        #channels: /fractaldepth

        The number of noise generations to use.
    Roughness:
        #channels: /roughness

        The amplitude reduction of higher frequency noise
        contributions.
    Attenuation:
        #channels: /attenuation

        Raises the noise to the given exponent.
    Frequency:
        #channels: /frequencyx /frequencyy /frequencyz

        The scale of the noise. Decreasing frequency increases feature
        size.
    Minimum Value:
        #channels: /minvaluex /minvaluey /minvaluez

        Sets the minimum value that can be generated by the noise
        field.
    Maximum Value:
        #channels: /maxvaluex /maxvaluey /maxvaluez

        Sets the maximum value that can be generated by the noise
        field.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

        Allows the noise field to be effectively moved through space.
    Noise Type:
        Specifies the noise type.

        Hermite Interpolation:
            Fast, somewhat uniform.
        Sparse Convolution:
            Slower, more random.
        Improved Hermite:
            Fast, better randomness than Hermite Interpolation.
        Alligator Noise:
            Slow, cell-like noise.
    Generate Scalar Noise:
        #channels: /scalarnoise

        Causes the noise field to generate a single value for the
        noise, rather than generating three dimensional noise. 

	This
        allows the Noise Field to be used to scale the magnitude of a
        force without affecting its direction, as would happen if the
        three dimensions of noise varied independently.
