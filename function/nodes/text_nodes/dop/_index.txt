Dynamics nodes set up the conditions and rules for dynamics simulations.

Inputs and outputs:
    A dynamics node may have an object input (gray), data inputs
    (green), or both (see  [objects and data|/dyno]
    ). You should connect like to like (gray to gray and green to
    green).

    A dynamics node can have an object output, or a data output. Some
    nodes will switch their output type based on what inputs are
    connected. This allows the more convenient method of connecting
    nodes "inline" instead of using Apply Data nodes (see [objects and
    data|/dyno]).

Display flag:
    When Houdini runs the simulation, it cooks the network up from the
    node with the display flag to establish relationships between
    objects and data. So, nodes connected after the node with the
    display flag have no effect on the simulation.
    
Bypass flag:
    When the bypass flag is on, this node has no effect.
