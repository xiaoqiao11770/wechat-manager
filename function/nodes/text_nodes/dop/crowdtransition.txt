= Crowd Transition =

"""Defines a transition between crowd states."""

This node defines a [transition|/crowds/triggers] from one [crowd state|Node:dop/crowdstate] to another.
The input is a [trigger|Node:dop/crowdtrigger] that initiates the transition when its condition evaluates to true.

@parameters
    Input State:
        A string pattern that specifies which states to transition out of.
        The state names correspond to the __State Name__ parameter on a [Crowd State|Node:dop/crowdstate] node.
        The pattern follows the same syntax as the [match|Vex:match] VEX function.

        - `*` will match all states.
        - `* ^walk` will match all states except for the `walk` state.
        - `walk run_*` will match the `walk` state and all states whose names begin with `run_`.
    Output State:
        Name of the state to transition into. This corresponds to the __State Name__ parameter on a [Crowd State|Node:dop/crowdstate] node.
    Duration:
        Length of the transition between states in seconds.
    Random Time Offset:
        Adds a random time offset to the start of the transition. This produces a more random look for the crowd.
    Time:
        Specifies the maximum random time that the transition can be delayed by.

@inputs
    Crowd Trigger, Crowd Trigger Logic

@outputs
    Agent primitives
