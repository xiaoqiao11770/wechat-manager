= Cloth Material =

"""Defines the physical material for a deformable surface."""

The Cloth Material DOP defines the internal forces of a cloth object. It
is not a Force DOP like the [Gravity Force DOP|Node:dop/gravity], and is
only recognized by the [Cloth Solver|Node:dop/clothsolver]. It is
created automatically as part of the [Cloth Object
DOP|Node:dop/clothobject].

See [cloth forces|/dyno/cloth#forces] for more infomation.

== Attributes ==

    You can  [create attributes|/model/attributes]  on the cloth
    object's geometry to influence its behavior. Most of these
    attributes allow fine-tuning of the cloth by scaling (multiplying)
    default values set in this node.

@parameters
    Stretch Stiffness:
        #channels: /stretchstiffness

        The stretch stiffness parameter defines how strongly the cloth
        resists stretching.
    Shear Stiffness:
        #channels: /shearstiffness

        The shear stiffness parameter defines how strongly the cloth
        resists shearing.
    Bend Stiffness:
        #channels: /bendstiffness

        The bend stiffness parameter defines how strongly the cloth
        resists bending.
    Stretch Damping:
        #channels: /stretchdamp

        The stretch damping parameter defines how much the cloth
        resists oscillation due to the stretch force.
    Shear Damping:
        #channels: /sheardamp

        The shear damping parameter defines how much the cloth resists
        oscillation due to the shear force.
    Bend Damping:
        #channels: /benddamp

        The bend damping parameter defines how much the cloth resists
        oscillation due to the bend force.
