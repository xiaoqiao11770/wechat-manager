= Mask Field =

The Mask Field DOP use a scalar field, vector field, or point cloud to define a three dimensional mask.  The mask can be used to modify forces and torques when attached to Force data.  The value of the mask at a given location is multiplied by the amount of force and torque generated by the Force data at that location.

@parameters
    Treat as SDF:
        #channels: /treatassdf

        Treats the source field as a signed distance field where positive
        values indicate areas outside of the masking object.
    Invert Sign:
        #channels: /invert

        Inverts the inside/outside test when "Treat as SDF" is enabled.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offset

        The amount to expand the surface defined by the signed distance field
        when "Treat as SDF" is enabled.
    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Scales the mask value.
    Max Distance:
        #channels: /maxdistance

        Specifies how far the masked volume extends from each point in any
        attached point cloud.
    Minimum Value:
        #channels: /minvaluex, /minvaluey, /minvaluez

        Sets the minimum value that can be generated by the field.
    Maximum Value:
        #channels: /maxvaluex, /maxvaluey, /maxvaluez

        Sets the maximum value that can be generated by the field.
