"""A microsolver that extrapolates a field's value along an SDF. """

The Gas Extrapolate DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Extrapolate DOP extrapolates a field value along an SDF. The
field's value at an isosurface will be copied outwards along the
increasing direction of the surface field.

If __Surface Index__ and __Geometry__ data are provided, extrapolation
will be performed by looking up the closest point as specified in 
__Surface Index__ and interpolating the value from __Field__ at that
point position. If the __Valid__ field data is also provided, only
samples in __Field__ that are marked as valid will be used when interpolating.

@parameters
    Field:
        The field to extrapolate. It can be a scalar, vector, or matrix
        field. It can be a space delimitted list of fields or a globbed
        match.
    Surface Field:
        An SDF which describes where to start propagating values from
        and how to propagate them. Field values are sent in the
        increasing direction by default.
    Surface Index Field:
        An Index field that contains the number of the valid closest point, usually the 
        closest point on the surface.  This field can be created by the 
        [Gas Particle To SDF DOP|Node:dop/gasparticletosdf].
    Collision Field:
        An SDF that describes the collision objects in a simulation.  If interpolating from
        a closest point value in the __Geometry__ data, the point position will first be
        projected outside this collision SDF to get values more likely to be valid.
    Valid Field:
        A field which stores 0-1 values indicating which values in the __Field__ are valid
        and can be used for interpolation from closest points.  In particular, the
        [Gas Project Non Divergent Variational DOP|Node:dop/gasprojectnondivergentvariational] can set this field's values to indicate which velocity values are valid.  If provided,
        this field must be aligned with __Field__.
    Geometry:
        The Geometry data containing the points referenced by the __Surface Index__ field.
        These `v` attribute of these particles will also be used to calculate the maximum
        fluid speed if __Use Max Speed__ is enabled.
    Starting Value:
        The isosurface which is used as the start of the extrapolation
        is given by this value.
    Extrapolate in positive direction:
        The field values may either be extrapolated to the side of the
        SDF with higher or lower values. Extrapolating in the positive
        direction corresponds to extrapolating towards the outside.

    Use Max Distance:
        Determines if the extrapolation will stop when the maximum
        distance is reached.
    Max Distance:
        The distance, as measured by values in the surface field, away
        from the starting value to stop the extrapolation.

    Use Max Cells:
        Determines if extrapolation stops after a certain number of
        cells have been traversed.
    Max Cells:
        The voxel size is used to calculate a maximum distance for a
        given number of cells and this is used to clamp the
        extrapolation.

    Use Max Speed:
        Use the maximum speed of the particles specified in
        __Geometry__ and the field specified in __Max Speed Source__
        to expand the bandwidth for extrapolation.  This can 
        be useful to increase the extrapolation when a fluid is moving
        quickly.
    Max Speed Source: 
        A vector field containing velocities, the maximum speed of which
        will be used to expand the bandwidth.
    Max Speed Scale:
        A scale applied to the maximum speed before using it to
        expand the bandwidth.

    Clamp Out Of Bounds:
        Determines if cells outside of the maximum extrapolation range
        should be set to a specific value.
    Clamp Value:
        Value to set cells outside of the extrapolation range to.  By
        zeroing out distant cells, one can allow the tiles they reside
        in to be compressed more efficiently.
    Tolerance:
        The tolerance used when projecting closest points in __Geometry__
        outside the __Collision__ field when provided.
