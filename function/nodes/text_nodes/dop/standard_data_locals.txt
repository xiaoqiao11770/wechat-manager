channelname:
    This DOP node defines a local variable for each channel and
    parameter on the Data Options page, with the same name as the
    channel. So for example, the node may have channels for Position
    (positionx, positiony, positionz) and a parameter for an object name
    (objectname). 
    
    Then there will also be local variables with the names
    positionx, positiony, positionz, and objectname. These variables
    will evaluate to the previous value for that parameter. 
    
    This previous value is always stored as part of the data attached to the
    object being processed. This is essentially a shortcut for a
    dopfield expression like:

    {{{
    dopfield($DOPNET, $OBJID, dataName, "Options", 0, channelname)
    }}}
    
    If the data does not already exist, then a value of zero or an
    empty string will be returned.

DATACT:
    This value is the simulation time (see variable ST) at which the
    current data was created. This value may not be the same as the
    current simulation time if this node is modifying existing data,
    rather than creating new data.
DATACF:
    This value is the simulation frame (see variable SF) at which the
    current data was created. This value may not be the same as the
    current simulation frame if this node is modifying existing data,
    rather than creating new data.
RELNAME:
    This value will be set only when data is being attached to a relationship
    (such as when Constraint Anchor DOP is connected to the second, third, of
    fourth inputs of a Constraint DOP). 
    
    In this case, this value is set to the
    name of the relationship the data to which the data is being attached.
RELOBJIDS:
    This value will be set only when data is being attached to a relationship
    (such as when Constraint Anchor DOP is connected to the second, third, of
    fourth inputs of a Constraint DOP). 
    
    In this case, this value is set to a
    string that is a space separated list of the object identifiers for all
    the Affected Objects of the relationship to which the data is being
    attached.
RELOBJNAMES:
    This value will be set only when data is being attached to a relationship
    (such as when Constraint Anchor DOP is connected to the second, third, of
    fourth inputs of a Constraint DOP). 
    
    In this case, this value is set to a
    string that is a space separated list of the names of all the Affected
    Objects of the relationship to which the data is being attached.
RELAFFOBJIDS:
    This value will be set only when data is being attached to a relationship
    (such as when Constraint Anchor DOP is connected to the second, third, of
    fourth inputs of a Constraint DOP). 
    
    In this case, this value is set to a
    string that is a space separated list of the object identifiers for all
    the Affector Objects of the relationship to which the data is being
    attached.
RELAFFOBJNAMES:
    This value will be set only when data is being attached to a relationship
    (such as when Constraint Anchor DOP is connected to the second, third, of
    fourth inputs of a Constraint DOP). 
    
    In this case, this value is set to a
    string that is a space separated list of the names of all the Affector
    Objects of the relationship to which the data is being attached.
