= Bullet Solver =

""" Sets and configures an Bullet Dynamics solver. """

The Bullet Solver DOP sets objects to use the Bullet Dynamics solver.

This solver can use simplified representation of the objects, such as boxes or 
spheres, or a composite of these simple shapes to make-up a more complex shape.  
This solver can use arbitrary convex shapes based on the geometry points of the
object, and can also collide objects against affectors that are cloth, solid, or wire objects.

NOTE:
        For mutual interaction between wire and bullet objects, the [Wire Solver's|Node:dop/wiresolver] __Collision Handling__ parameter should be set to __SDF__.

NOTE:
    Collision of concave shapes is known to have some problems, and is not fully supported.

WARNING:
    The Bullet Solver does not support scaling at the object level.
