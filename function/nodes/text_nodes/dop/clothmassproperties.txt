= Cloth Mass Properties =

"""Defines the mass properties."""

The Cloth Mass Properties DOP controls the mass density of the cloth.

@parameters
    Surface Mass Density:
        #channels: /surfacemassdensity

        The mass of the cloth per squared units of length. For example, kg per square meter, when the unit of length is meters.

        By itself, the __Surface Mass Density__ specifies a single surface mass density that's the same over the entire object geometry.
        The point attribute `surfacemassdensity` is recognized by the cloth solver as a multiplier for this parameter.
        It can be used to make parts of the cloth heavier or lighter.
