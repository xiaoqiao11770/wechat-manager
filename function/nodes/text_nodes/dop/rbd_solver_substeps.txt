Minimum Substeps:
    The RBD Solver will break a full timestep into at least this
    number of substeps. 
    
    By increasing this, you can guarantee a
    minimum fineness to the substepping. This can be used if for
    some reason the automatic computations are too coarse.
Maximum Substeps:
    The RBD Solver will not break the simulation down into more
    substeps than this. 
    
    It is a very good idea to always have a
    maximum to ensure frames will be finished regardless of their
    complexity. Lowering this ceiling can ensure a minimum
    computation time at the expense of accuracy.
CFL Condition:
    The CFL Condition is a factor used for automatically
    determining what size substep a scene requires. The idea is that
    any substep should not allow any objects to interpenetrate by
    more than one voxel cell. 
    
    This condition is met when this
    parameter is at 1. A value of 10 would allow a substep to
    interpenetrate by as many as 10 voxel cells. This could allow
    objects to tunnel through each other rather than properly
    bounce.
