#type: include
Stretch Threshold:
    #channels: /plasticstretchthreshold

    This parameter defines the amount of stretching allowed before the
    wire is permanently stretched.
Stretch Rate:
    #channels: /plasticstretchrate

    This parameter defines how quickly a wire's permanent shape becomes
    stretched.
Stretch Hardening:
    #channels: /plasticstretchhardening

    This parameter defines how a wire becomes stiffer (if greater than 1) or
    weaker (if less than 1) when permanently stretched.
Bend Threshold:
    #channels: /plasticbendthreshold

    This parameter defines the amount of bending allowed before the
    wire is permanently bent.
Bend Rate:
    #channels: /plasticbendrate

    This parameter defines how quickly a wire's permanent shape becomes
    bent.
Bend Hardening:
    #channels: /plasticbendhardening

    This parameter defines how a wire becomes stiffer (if greater than 1) or
    weaker (if less than 1) when permanently bent.
