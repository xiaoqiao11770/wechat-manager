= Particle Fluid Sink =

"""Removes fluid particles that flow inside of a specified boundary from a simulation."""

Attach this node to input 3 of the Particle Fluid Solver to
create a sink/drain in the fluid simulation.  This sink removes
fluid particles from the simulation when they flow inside of
a certain boundary.  Bounding boxes, bounding spheres, metaballs
or arbitrary bounding objects can be used as sinks.

TIP:
    For the desired results, make sure that this node is connected
    to the third input of the [Particle Fluid Solver|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver] (the second green
    input).  The solver may behave unpredictably if it is connected to
    any other input.

@parameters

    Bounding Type:
        Specifies the type of bounding geometry used as a sink/drain.
        
	Bounding boxes and spheres provide the most efficient method
        of draining particles from a simulation, while bounding objects
        and metaballs can be used to provide more general but less 
        sinks.

    Size:
        If __Bounding Type__ is set to "Bounding Box" or "Bounding Sphere",
        this specifies the size of the bounding geometry.

    Center:
        If __Bounding Type__ is set to "Bounding Box" or "Bounding Sphere",
        this specifies the center of the bounding geometry.

    SOP:
        If __Bounding Type__ is set to "Bounding Object" or "Bounding
        Metaball", this specifies the SOP containing the bounding geometry.

    Ignore Transform Object:
        When this option is off, the bounding geometry specified in __SOP__
        is automatically transformed in to the object space of the bounding
        geometry.  When it is off, the geometry is not transformed.

    Density Minimum:
        If __Bounding Type__ is set to "Bounding Metaball", this option
        controls the minimum metaball density at which particles will
        be removed from the simulation.  

	The metaball field is evaluated
        at each particle location, and particles are removed in locations
        where the metaball density exceeds this threshold.
