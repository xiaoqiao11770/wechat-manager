"""A microsolver that applies a wind force."""

The Gas Wind DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users could try to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Wind DOP applies a wind force, adjusting the velocity field
in the direction of the ambient wind direction.

@parameters
    Time Scale:
	The rate at which the wind is applied is scaled by the timestep size.
	This parameter further scales that rate.
    Wind Direction:
	Which direction the wind is blowing in.
    Wind Scale:
	The speed of the wind.
    Turn Speed:
	The rate at which the fluid's direction will turn towards the wind.
    Join Speed:
	The rate at which the fluid's speed will change to match the wind.
