= POP Interact =

"""A POP node that applies forces between particles."""

The POP Interact node applies a forces to particles based on their closest neighbors.  This can be used to keep particles apart or to make them match velocities.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Parameters ==

	Position Force:
	    How strongly the particles force each other apart.
	Velocity Force:
	    How strongly the particles try to match each other's velocities.
	Core Radius:
	    The inner radius where the interaction force will have full strength.
	Falloff Radius:
	    This additional distance from the core radius specifies where the interaction force will fall to zero.
