= Anchor: Object Space Position =

"""Defines a position by specifying a position in the space of some simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Space Position belongs to a class of DOP nodes that
define position or orientation values for use in building constraints.
This anchor defines a position by specifying a position in the space of
some simulation object.

A common use of this type of anchor would be for rigid body objects
which can be constrained at arbitrary positions relative to the center
of mass of the object.


@parameters
    Object:
        #channels: /object

        Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used
        to find the point position.
    Initialize With World Space Position:
        Turning on this parameter causes this anchor to calculate a
        value for the __Offset__ based on the supplied __World Space Position__.
        
        To do this, the anchor simply transforms the __World Space
        Position__ into an object space __Offset__ relative to the center of
        mass of the object.
    World Space Position:
        #channels: /worldspaceposx /worldspaceposy /worldspaceposz

        When the __Initialize With World Space Position__ parameter is
        turned on, this value specifies the world space position used to
        find the object space __Offset__.
    Offset:
        #channels: /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

        Specifies an offset in object space from the center of mass of
        the object referenced by this anchor.
