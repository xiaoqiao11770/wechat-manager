= Vortex Force =

""" Applies a vortex-like force on objects, causing them to orbit about
an axis along a circular path. """

The Vortex Force DOP applies a vortex-like force on objects, causing
them to orbit around a curve. They are great for creating tornado like effects.

Vortex Forces work well with FLIP fluid simulations. All you need to prepare ahead of time is an open curve that will be the center spine for the vortex.

Geometry data defining the orbits must be attached to this DOP as
subdata. The geometry should consist of a single open curve, defining
the central axis of the vortex. 

The Vortex Force will define a number of
circular orbiting paths around this axis, and at each time step, the
force will try to push an object to the closest orbiting path. The
number of different orbiting paths along the axis is determined by the
__Density__ parameter. The position of the axis can be controlled by
attaching a [Position DOP|Node:dop/position] as subdata.

The geometry must define two point attributes: one representing the
radius of the circular orbit, and another defining the orbiting
velocity. There are also a number of optional attributes, providing more
control over the vortex behavior.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of this node, which adds
the noise as subdata of the force data.

@parameters

    == Data Options ==

        Orbital Radius Attribute:
            The radius of the circular orbiting path around the axis is
            determined by a point attribute on the axis geometry. 
            
            This parameter controls the name of that point attribute.
        Orbital Velocity Attribute:
            The orbital speed around the axis is determined by a point
            attribute on the axis geometry. 
            
            This parameter controls the
            name of that point attribute. The units of the attribute are
            determined by the __Orbital Velocity Type__ parameter.
        Orbital Velocity Type:
            The interpretation of the __Orbital Velocity Attribute__ on
            the axis geometry is determined by this parameter.

            Tangential Velocity:
                The orbital velocity attribute is a linear velocity,
                measured in meters per second (m/s).
            Angular Velocity:
                The orbital velocity attribute is an angular velocity,
                measured in degrees per second (deg/s).
        Orbital Direction Attribute:
            By default, the circular orbiting paths are in planes
            perpendicular to the axis geometry. (This default behavior
            can be further controlled using the __Polyline Orbital
            Direction__ parameter.) 
            
            If the point attribute defined by this parameter is present, however, it is used to define the normal of the circular orbiting plane.
        Polyline Orbital Direction:
            When the __Orbital Direction Attribute__ parameter is not
            being used, the circular orbiting paths are in planes
            perpendicular to the axis geometry. 
             
            This parameter controls how "perpendicular" is determined from the axis geometry. First, the closest segment on the axis is found, and then
            the slope at either its previous or next vertex is used to
            define the orbital plane.

            Use Next Vertex:
                Use the slope at the next vertex to define the orbital
                plane.
            Use Previous Vertex:
                Use the slope at the previous vertex to define the
                orbital plane.
            Use Both Vertices:
                Average the slopes at the next and previous vertices to
                define the orbital plane.
        Max Distance Attribute:
            By default, the vortex force acts on all objects, but it
            can be limited to only act on objects within a limited
            range. 
            
            This is done by creating a point attribute defining
            the threshold for action. (A value of -1 can be used to
            represent an infinite distance.) This parameter controls the
            name of that attribute.
        Lift Force Attribute:
            By default, the vortex force acts in the plane
            perpendicular to the axis, and does not cause movement
            parallel to the axis. A special "lift force" can optionally
            be applied to move objects along the axis. 
            
            The lift force
            only acts within a limited radius, and can have a falloff.
            This parameter defines the name of a point attribute
            determining the strength of the lift force.
        Lift Radius Multiplier:
            The lift force only acts within a limited distance from the
            axis. By default (when this parameter is set to one), it
            only acts inside the orbital paths. 
            
            Setting this parameter
            to a value greater than one will allow the lift force to act
            at greater distances, while a value smaller than one will
            limit it to a smaller distance.
        Lift Force Falloff:
            This parameter determines how much the lift force decreases
            as objects get further from the central axis. 
            
            A value of one
            indicates no falloff, while higher values correspond to
            higher falloffs.
        Orbital Density:
            This controls how many orbiting paths are defined along the
            axis. 
            
            High values create more paths, possibly through
            interpolation, and can be useful if the axis has a
            complicated shape.
        Drag Constant:
            A value that determines how fast the object converges to
            desired orbital velocity.

        Sampling Mode:
            Indicates the preferred sampling level (point, circle, or sphere) to trade accuracy for efficiency of the computation.
