= Filament Object =

"""Creates a vortex filament object from SOP Geometry."""

The Filament Object DOP creates a new object inside the DOP simulation, and attaches the subdata required for it to be solved by the [Filament Solver|Node:dop/filamentsolver].

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  

	The latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the DOP network level.

    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The object is created only when the current frame number is equal to this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be created. 

	For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the __Timestep__ parameter of the DOP Network must be changed to `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a timestep at frame 3.5.

    Object Name:
        The name for the created object.  This is the name that shows up in the details view and is used to reference this particular object externally.  

	NOTE:
		While it is possible to have many objects with the same name, this complicates writing references, so it is recommended to use something like `$OBJID` in the name.

    Initial Geometry:
        The path to a SOP containing curves which will be used as the initial state of the vortex filaments. 

    Use Object Transform:
        Specifies whether or not the transform of the object containing the __Initial Geometry__ should be embedded in the Geometry data.

    Display Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry is displayed in the viewport. Does not reset the simulation when it is changed.

    Scale Strength:
        Adjusts the strength of each filament. The `strength` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

    Scale Thickness:
        Adjusts the thickness of each filament. The `thickness` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

@outputs

        The simulation object created by this node is sent through the single output.
