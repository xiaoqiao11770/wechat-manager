= SOP Guide =

The SOP Guide DOP pulls geometry from a SOP for use as DOP guides.
The geometry of the SOP is not computed during the simulation, but instead
at display time and only if the guide is visualized.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
	Whether the guide geometry should show up in the viewport.

	If not selected, it will not be computed.

    Color:
	The detail `Cd` attribute will be replaced by this color.  This
	will cause geometry to draw in this color, but still be overridden
	by any point or primitive colors specified in the SOP.

    Draw Wireframe:
	A detail attribute, `gl_wireframe`, is set which forces the geometry
	to draw in wireframe.

    Use External SOP:
	Since this node is itself a SOP network, if this toggle isn't
	set the geometry imported will be the display SOP of the
	contained network.

    SOP Path:
        The SOP from which the geometry data is extracted.
