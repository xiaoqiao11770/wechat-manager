        td>> 
            The current velocity of the point.  Momentum is passed
            from frame to frame through this.

        td>>`conservation`
        td>>Point
        td>>Float
        td>> 
            Overrides the conservation parameter of the Wave Solver
            in a per-point manner. 
    tr>>
        td>>`wavespeed`
        td>>Point
        td>>Float
        td>> 
            Overrides the wavespeed parameter of the Wave Solver
            in a per-point manner.  
            
            NOTE:
                Adaptive substepping does not take overridden wavespeeds into account. Therefore, the value on the Wave Solver node should be the maximum of the values on the points.
    tr>>
        td>>`springk`
        td>>Point
        td>>Float
        td>> 
            Overrides the rest spring parameter of the Wave Solver
            on a per-point manner.
