= POP Soft Limit =

"""A POP node that creates a spongy boundary."""

The [POP Property|Node:dop/popproperty] node slows particles down when they hit the boundary, giving a less jerky response than a limit or collision.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

@parameters
[Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

== Behavior ==
Type:
    Shape of the limit boundary.

    Box:
	Rectangular limit, the corners of which are defined by the __Size__ and __Center__ parameters below.
    Sphere:
	Spherical limit. The sphere is still defined by a bounding rectangle with the limit parameters below.
Size:
    The size of the limit object.
Center:
    The center of the limit object.

Invert:
    Controls how the motion of particles is affected by the collision.  By default, particles are kept inside of the limit boundary.  If you invert, they are kept outside.

Force:
    The constant force that should be applied in the shortest direction out of the sponge.

Dampening:
    The force is reduced by the component of the particle's velocity traveling out of the sponge. It is increased by the component traveling into the sponge. This parameter scales the result of
    that calculation. The total force is never negative.
