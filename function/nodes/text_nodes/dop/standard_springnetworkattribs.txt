        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>> If the `name` attribute is not present, identifies the DOP object to which the spring is attached by object ID.  An invalid object ID indicates the spring is attached to a world space position.

        td>> Point
        td>> String
        td>> Identifies the DOP object to which the spring is attached by object name.  An invalid name indicates the spring is attached to a world space position.

        td>> `P`
        td>> Point
        td>> Vector
        td>> Identifies the world space position to which the spring is attached.

        td>> `pointid`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>> Identifies the point ID within the DOP object to which the spring is attached.  If the DOP object's geometry does not contain an `id` attribute, the value is treated as a point number.

        td>> `restlength`
        td>> Primitive
        td>> Float
        td>> Defines the rest length of the spring.

        td>> `v`
        td>> Point
        td>> Vector
        td>> Identifies the velocity of the world space position to which the spring is attached.
