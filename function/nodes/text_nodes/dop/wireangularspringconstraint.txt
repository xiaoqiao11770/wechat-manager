"""Constrains a wire point's orientation to a certain direction,
with a set amount of springiness."""

The Wire Angular Spring Constraint DOP is a digital asset which provides
controls for setting up basic spring constraints for use with Wire
Objects.  This involves constraining the orientation on the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject]
to a "goal" orientation derived from animation on the Wire Object's
geometry, another simulation object or from an orientation in world space.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrained Points:
            #channels: /ptgroup

            Identifies the points in the wire object to be constrained.
        Constrain To Internal Animation:
            #channels: /useanimation

            Constrains points to animation present on the input geometry.  
            
            The __Use Animated Geometry__ parameter on the constrained Wire Object's
            node should be enabled to make the animation available to the DOP
            simulation.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies an wire object used to determine the goal
            orientation. 
            
            If this parameter is left blank then the
            objects will be constrained to a world space orientation.
        Goal Points:
            #channels: /goalpts

            Identifies the points in the goal object to use for the goal
            orientation. The constrained points are paired with the goal 
	    points in the order in which they are given.

            If there are more constrained points than goal points, the
            "leftover" points are constrained to the last specified goal
            point.  "Leftover" goal points will not be used.

            If no points are specified, the initial orientation of
            the constrained point should be used.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space to which the wire object
            will be constrained.
        Goal Rotation:
            #channels: /goalrotation

            Specifies the goal rotation for the constrained wire object.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.

    == Spring ==

        Strength:
            #channels: /strength

            Controls how strongly the spring constraint acts on the
            constrained object to return the anchors to the same
            orientation.
        Damping:
            #channels: /damping

            Controls the amount of damping in the spring relationship.
            
            As damping increases, the spring constraint acts more slowly
            and oscillates less.
        Rest Rotation:
            #channels: /restrotation

            Sets the rest angle between the object and goal. 
            
            The force
            applied on a constrained object by a solver will tend to
            keep the object rotated by this amount relative to the goal
            object.
        Limit Torque:
            #channels: /limittorque

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            torque applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds the
            maximum specified by the __Maximum Torque__ parameter.
        Maximum Torque:
            #channels: /maxtorque

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. 
            
            If the torque applied to satisfy this constraint exceeds this
            threshold, the constraint will be disabled.
        Limit Rotation:
            #channels: /limitrotation

            If this is set, the constraint will be disabled if the
            angle between the two constrained objects exceeds the
            maximum specified by the __Maximum Rotation__ parameter.
        Maximum Rotation:
            #channels: /maxrotation

            Sets a threshold for disabling the constraint. If the angle
            between the two constrained objects exceeds this threshold,
            the constraint will be disabled.
