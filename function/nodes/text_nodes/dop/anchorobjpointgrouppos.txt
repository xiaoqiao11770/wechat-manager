= Anchor: Object Point Group Position =

"""Defines multiple points, specified by their number or group, on the given geometry of a simulation object."""

The Anchor: Object Point Group Position belongs to a class of DOP nodes 
that define position or orientation values for use in building constraints. 

This anchor defines multiple points, specified by their number or group, 
on the given geometry of a simulation object.


@parameters
    Object:
	#channels: /object

	Identifies the object with the geometry data that will be used to 
	find the group of points.
    Geometry:
	#channels: /geometry
	
	Identifies the geometry data of the given object that will be used
	to find the group of points.
    Point Group:
	#channels:  /pointgroup

	Specifies the selection of points that define the positions of 
	this anchor.
    Offset:
	#channels:  /offsetx /offsety /offsetz

	Specifies an offset in object space from the geometry point
	position.
    Offset Attribute Name:
	#channels: /offsetattribname

	Overrides the __Offset__ of each point by applying the value of the
	given attribute on a per-point basis.
    Constraint Type:
	#channels: /condof

	Controls if/how the constrained object can move in reaction to 
	the pull of the "goal" (the point to which the object is 
	constrained).

	Free to Move in Any Direction:
	    The constraint has no effect.
	Constrained to Plane (Specify Normal):
	    The object can move along a plane defined by the goal location
	    and the normal you specify in the __Constraint Direction__
	    parameter.
	Constrained to Line (Specify Direction):
	    The object can move along an axis defined by the goal location
	    and the direction you specify in the __Constraint Direction__
	    parameter.
	Constrained to Point:
	    The object exactly follows the goal.
    Constraint Type Attribute Name:
	#channels: /condofattribname

	Overrides the __Constraint Type__ of each point by applying the value
	of the given attribute on a per-point basis.
    Constraint Direction:
	#channels: /condirx /condiry /condirz

	When __Constraint Type__ is __Constrained to Plane__, this value
	defines the normal of a plane centered at the goal location.

	When __Constraint Type__ is __Constrained to Line__, this value
	defines the direction of an axis running through the goal location.
    Constraint Direction Attribute Name:
	#channels: /condirattribname

	Overrides the __Constraint Direction__ of each point by applying the
	value of the given attribute on a per-point basis.
