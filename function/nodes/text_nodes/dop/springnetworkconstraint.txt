= Spring Network Constraint =

"""Constrains pairs of SBD objects together according to a polygon network."""

The spring network constraint defines pairs of SBD objects that should be
constrained together.

With the spring network constraint, SOP Geometry is specified which defines
which objects should be constrained.  This makes it easy to procedurally
generate a set of constraint relationships.  Each point in the geometry
represents a DOP object's point, according to the `name` and `pointid`
attributes.  Each two-point polygon represents a spring constraint.

NOTE:
    Spring Network Constraint is a digital asset.

== Attributes ==

You can [create attributes|/model/attributes] on the geometry to customize
each spring's behavior.  Most of these attributes allow fine-tuning of the
wire by scaling values set in this node.

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Constraint Network:
    The SOP geometry to use to determine the constraints.

Overwrite with SOP:
    This flag will re-import the network whenever it is set, allowing a
    completely animated spring behavior.

Strength:
    Specifies the strength of the spring connections.

Damping:
    Specifies the damping strength of the spring connections.

@inputs
    Object:
	The objects to apply this relationship to, that will be eligible for
	being constrained by the object name attribute.
    Solvers:
	SOP solvers may be attached to update the spring network dynamically in
	response to events.  Only a single geometry is shared by all the
	objects, so this solver is executed once per relationship, not per
	object.
