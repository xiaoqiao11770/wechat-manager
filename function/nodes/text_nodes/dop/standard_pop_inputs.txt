#type: include
First Input:
    This optional input has two purposes.

    First, if it is wired to other POP nodes, they will be executed prior to this node executing.  The chain of nodes will be processed in a top-down manner.

    Second, if the input chain has a stream generator (such as [POP Location|Node:dop/poplocation],
    [POP Source|Node:dop/popsource], or [POP Stream|Node:dop/popstream]), this node will only operate on the particles in that stream.
