= Output =

"""Serves as the end-point of the simulation network.
Has controls for writing out sim files."""

The Output DOP is usually used to mark the end of a DOP simulation chain.
It should normally always have the Output flag set on itself.

It also provides the capabilities of the [Dynamics ROP|Node:out/dop].

Output from this node can be played back using
[DOP Network Playback|Node:obj/dopnet#playback_simulation]

@parameters

Save to Disk:
    #id: execute

    Saves the simulation to disk as a sequence of .sim files.

Save to Disk in Background:
    #id: executebackground

    Starts another copy of Houdini in the background and instructs that
    copy to save out the simulation as a sequence of .sim files.  This
    allows one to continue working and load the .sim files as they
    complete.

Start/End/Inc:
    Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive. 

    These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

    `$NRENDER`:
        The number of frames to be rendered by the output driver.
    `$N`:
        The current frame being rendered (starting at 1 and going to `$NRENDER`).

Render with Take:
    #id: take

    Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
    __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

Output File:
    The file to save the simulation state to. Make sure to  [include
    $SF in the filename|/render/expressions]  to write out
    separate files for each frame.

Output Every Sim Frame Using $SF:
    Every single simulation frame will be output, rather than just
    the frames hit by the step rate of the frame range.  In this
    mode one just has to set the entire range without worrying
    about how sub-stepping will be set up.

    `$SF` should be used instead of `$F` in the file name in these
    cases.

[Include:../out/standard#mkpath]

Initialize Simulation OPs:
    Force all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
    Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.

    This is the safest way to render out a simulation, because it
    starts the simulation from scratch and discards any partial
    simulations you might have done with different parameters.
    However, throwing away an already-cooked simulation can be
    expensive, especially for relatively slow solvers such as
    fluids.

Alfred Style Progress:
    A percentage complete value is printed out as files are
    written. This is in the style expected by Pixar's Alfred
    render queue.
