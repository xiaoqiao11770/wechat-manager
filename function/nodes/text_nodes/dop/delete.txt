= Delete =

"""Deletes both objects and data according to patterns."""

The Delete DOP can both delete data from simulation objects and delete
entire objects from the simulation.


@parameters
    Activation:
        #channels: /activation

        The deletion rules are only applied to an object if the
        Activation parameter is not zero.

        Since this parameter is evaluated for each input object,
        expressions in this parameter can make use of object-specific
        local variables such as `OBJID`.

    Number of Deletions:
        Sets the number of object or data deletion rules that will be
        applied to the input objects. The delete operations are applied
        in the order in which they are specified in the dialog.
    Object Group <<n>>:
        #channels: /objgroup<<n>>

        Only those inputs objects that are in the group mask specified
        by this parameter are affected by this deletion rule. This
        parameter can be a list of object groups, individual objects, or
        object names using wildcards.

        A blank entry will affect no objects. A value of * will affect
        all objects.

    Delete Objects <<n>>:
        By default, a deletion rule will delete any object that has
        both a non-zero activation parameter and belongs to the object
        group. 

	This toggle can be turned off to disable the deletion of
        the entire object, causing the deletion rule to instead delete
        specific data contained in the object.
    Delete Data <<n>>:
        #channels: /deletedata<<n>>

        When the Delete Objects toggle for this deletion is turned off,
        this parameter contains a list of data names (which can use wild
        cards) to be removed from the objects.

        A value of Position would delete the Position data associated
        with an RBD Object. A value of * will delete all data attached
        to an object, turning it into an empty object.
