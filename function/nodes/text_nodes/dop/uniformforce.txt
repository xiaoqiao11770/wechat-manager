= Uniform Force =

"""Applies a uniform force and torque to objects. """

The Uniform Force DOP applies a precise amount of force and torque to
an object. The amount of force applied is independent of the mass,
position, or velocity of the object. 

For solvers that apply forces to
objects based on the area of the object's geometry, the force and torque
values are for a surface or unit area. Larger or smaller surfaces will
have the force scaled appropriately.

You can add noise to the force applied by this DOP by connecting a
[Noise DOP|Node:dop/noise] to the second input of the node, which adds the noise as
subdata of the force data.
