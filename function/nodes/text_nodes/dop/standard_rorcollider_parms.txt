Reverse Collision Object Roles:
    Each collider interprets a pair of simulation objects in a certain
    way. The [Cloth/Volume Collider|Node:dop/clothvolumecollider], for
    example, treats one object as a piece of cloth, and the other as a
    volume. The name of the collider generally tells you what objects it
    expects.

    When a solver calls a collider, it always passes the object it is
    solving as the first argument to the collider. So when the Cloth
    Solver calls the Cloth/Volume collider, it passes the cloth object
    first, as the collider expects.

    However, if you set up an [RBD solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver] to use a [Cloth/Volume Collider|Node:dop/clothvolumecollider]
    to detect collisions between an [RBD object|Node:dop/rbdobject] (represented as a volume)
    and a [cloth object|Node:dop/clothobject], the RBD solver will pass the object it is
    solving (the RBD object) to the collider first, and the cloth object
    second, the reverse of what the collider expects. In this case, turn
    on __Reverse Collision Object Roles__ to automatically reverse the
    arguments passed to the collider.
