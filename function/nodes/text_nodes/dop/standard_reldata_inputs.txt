#type: include
First Input:
    This optional input can be used to control which simulation objects
    may be involved in the relationship created by this node. 
    
    If this
    input is not connected, this node can be used in conjunction with an
    [Apply Relationship|Node:dop/applyrel] node to create many relationships
    at the same time.
All Other Inputs:
    If this node has more input connectors, data nodes can be attached to act
    as modifiers for the relationship described by this node. 
    
    The specific
    types of subdata that are meaningful vary from node to node. Click ((MMB)) an input connector to see a list of available data nodes that can be
    meaningfully attached.
