Calculation:
    The value of the destination field is `A`, the value of the source
    field is `B`. The value `D` is written to the destination field.

        Copy:
            `D = B`
        Add:
            `D = A + B`
        Subtract:
            `D = A - B`
        Multiply:
            `D = A * B`
        Divide:
            `D = A / B`
        Maximum:
            `D = max(A, B)`
        Minimum:
            `D = min(A, B)`
Dest, Source, Post Time Scales:
    The relevant add and/or multiply operand is scaled according
    to the current timestep.  If `a` is the addition operand and m
    the multiplication operand and `t` the timestep, the operands
    are changed as follows.

    None:
        `a = a`
        `m = m`
    Add:
        `a = a * t`
        `m = m`
    Multiply:
        `a = a`
        `m = e ^ (ln(m) * t)`
    Both:
        `a = a * t`
        `m = e ^ (ln(m) * t)`
    Divide:
        `a = a`
        `m = m / t`
    Linearly Scale Multiply:
        `a = a`
        `m = m * t`

Dest Pre-Add, Dest Pre-Mul:
    The `A` in the calculation is set to `A' = A * m + a`, where `m` is the
    Dest Pre-Mul and a the Dest Pre-Add.
Source Pre-Add, Source Pre-Mul:
    The `B` in the calculation is set to `B' = B * m + a`, where `m` is the
    Source Pre-Mul and a the Source Pre-Add.
Post-Add, Post-Mul:
    The `D` that the destination field is set to is modified by `D' = D * m + a,` where `m` is the Post-Mul and a is the Post-Add.
