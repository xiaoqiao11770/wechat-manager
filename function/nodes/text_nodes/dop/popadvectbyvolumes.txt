= POP Advect by Volumes =

"""A POP node that uses velocity volumes to move particles."""

The Advect by Volumes POP is designed to make it easy to advect a particle system by a fluid simulation.  Often the fluid simulation will be simulated as a separate pass and the velocity fields read off disk. However, the particles can be live-linked to an existing simulation.

This operator modifies the `force`, `vel`, and `P` attributes.

    == Parameters ==

    Velocity Source:
        The source of the velocity volumes.  The context geometry refer to the inputs of this DOP Network.
    
    SOP:
        The SOP path which has three volumes to be interpreted as the x, y, and z components of the velocity field.  These are often the result of importing a velocity field from a fluid simulation.  You can directly link to a fluid simulation with something like `/obj/AutoDopNetwork:smoke/vel`.
    
    DOP Object:
        The name of a DOP Object in the same simulation as this.
    
    Field Name:
        The name of the velocity field in the DOP object.
    
    Velocity Scale:
        A uniform scale to apply to the velocity field before any of the force applications.
    
    Advection Type:
        There are several different ways to update a particle system in response to an external velocity field.  They are broadly categorized as Force, Velocity, and Position updates.

        The __Update Force__ will adjust the acceleration of the particles according to the force scale, and the velocity field.  This acts like the [Force POP|Node:dop/popforce].

        __Update Velocity__ directly changes the velocity of the particles by blending in the velocity field, causing them to swiftly match the velocity field.

        __Update Position__ directly moves the particle positions.  This is useful as it allows the particles own velocity to be considered independently of the bulk fluid velocity.  __Update Position__ is similar to what the [Gas Advect DOP|Node:dop/gasadvect] would perform.

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#treataswindParms/]
    
    Force Scale:
        Scales the force for force update.
    
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#airresistanceParms/]

    Remap Force:
        Scale the force value by the force ramp, according to the `forceramp` variable in the VEXpression.

    Force Ramp:
        The ramp that is evaluated according to each particle's `forceramp` variable in the VEXpression.  This value should be in the range 0-1.

    Velocity Blend:
        In __Update Velocity__ mode, the amount to mix in the field velocity every timestep.
    
    Velocity Update:
        In __Update Position__ mode it is possible to read in the velocity from the velocity field.
        
        NOTE:
            The resulting velocity will be used by the particle integrator, so unless something special is done, this could result in double-moving the particle.

    Advection Method:
        The method used for advecting the particles.  The __Single Step__ method takes only a single
        step in the velocity field, but the various __Trace__ methods can take multiple steps
        within a voxel to avoid violating the __CFL Condition__.  These methods
        are more accurate but take multiple velocity samples per step and are more expensive to evaluate.

    CFL Condition:
        When tracing the particles, this controls how many voxels may be stepped in a single iteration. Higher
        values will result in faster tracing, and hence faster advection, but more errors.

    [Include:popCommonParms#massParms/]

    == Guide ==

    Show Guide:
        Controls if the guide geometry for this node should be shown. 
    
        NOTE:
            This can also be disabled by using the __Hidden__ flag on the DOP Node.

    Plane:
        What axis to extract from the volume.

    Offset:
        Where the plane should be positioned inside the volume.  This is a
        relative coordinate, with -1..1 being the total range, so 0 means the
        center of the volume.

    Resolution:
        The resolution of the visualization relative to the source velocity field.

    Range:
        The speeds that correspond to the beginning and end of the visualization colors.
