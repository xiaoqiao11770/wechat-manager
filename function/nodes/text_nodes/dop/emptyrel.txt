= Empty Relationship =

The Empty Relationship DOP is used to create a relationship between objects
that has no particular meaning. Objects with an empty relationship between
them do not alter the solve process for either object. 

The purpose of this
sort of relationship is only to control the solve order of the simulation
objects. By making one object an affector of another object using an empty
relationship, you can ensure the affector object gets solved before the
affected object, even though the objects do not actually alter each other in any way.
