"""A microsolver that seeds particles uniformly inside a surface."""

The Gas Seed Particles DOP is a microsolver used in building larger
fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Seed Particles DOP creates particles inside the surface. Their
`pscale` attribute is uniformly set to the particles size parameter
scaled by the voxel size. They are pushed in from the boundary of the
surface so the sphere representing the particle will be at most tangent
to the surface.


@parameters
    Particles:
        The geometry to add the particles to. This will accumulate
        blindly with any existing particles.
    Surface:
        A signed distance field representing the surface. The negative
        valued region will be populated with particles.
    Particles Per Voxel:
        How many particles to create inside each interior voxel.
    Particle Size:
        The size of the generated particles expressed as a fraction of
        the voxel size.
