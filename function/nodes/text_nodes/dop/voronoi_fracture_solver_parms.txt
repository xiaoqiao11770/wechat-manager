Minimum Piece Volume:
    The minimum volume for any piece geometry created by this solver.  This can avoid creating geometry that is too small for the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver] to handle in a stable manner.

Fuse Tolerance:
    The tolerance to use when fusing clustered pieces together.

Stamp Interior Primitives With Creation Time:
    Creates an attribute called `creationtime` on all newly-created interior primitives that stores their creation time.  This can be useful for effects such as emitting particles for debris for a short amount of time after the initial fracture of a primitive.

Allow Fracturing From Feedback:
    Usually fracturing is driven only by objects that solve before this object
    in the frame.  If two-way coupling between different solvers is done using
    feedbacks, this option allows those feedback effects to also trigger
    fracturing.

Fracture Ignores Resting Objects:
    Impacts generated by objects merely resting on each other will not be considered for fracturing.
    
Random Seed:
    This value is used to initialize the pseudo-random sequence used to generate fracture points during the simulation.  It is useful for generating different simulations from the same network.

Convert to Poly:
    The fracturing only works with polygonal geometry.  This option auto-converts the geometry into polygons at the given LOD.  This conversion only happens when the fracturing occurs.
