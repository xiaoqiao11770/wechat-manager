Prior to Houdini 12, the Pyro solver used DOP relationships to associate sources, pumps, sinks, and collision geometry with a fluid container, using the [Merge DOP|Node:dop/merge] and/or [Apply relationship DOP|Node:dop/applyrel] to create the relationship. The preferred method in Houdini 12 and later is to [use SOP networks to create sources, pumps, sinks, and collision geometry|/dyno/fluid_sourcing] and import them using the [Source volume DOP|Node:dop/sourcevolume].

If you want to use the old relationship method to set up sources, sinks, etc., you can enable relationships using the parameters on this tab. By default, relationships are turned off, and the solver ignores relationship data.

You can use both methods (import SOP geometry and attach it to the solver's "sourcing" input, as well as set up DOP object relationships). When relationships are enabled, the solver will combine the sources, sinks, etc. from both methods.

Enable Relationships:
    Use object relationship data to add sources, pumps, sinks, and collision geometry to the simulation (in addition to imported data connected to the sourcing input, if any).
