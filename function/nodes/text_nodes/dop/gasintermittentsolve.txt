"""A microsolver that solves its subsolvers at a regular interval."""

The Gas Intermittent Solve DOP is a microsolver used in building
larger fluid simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Intermittent Solve DOP will solve the solvers attached to it
at a regular interval.  This can ensure certain operations are done at
a different rate, or at a rate independent of any substepping.

@parameters
    Primary Solver:
        The specified input will be used as the primary solver for
        computing collision information.
    Only Once Per Timestep:
        If the solve rate is faster than the substepping, intermittent
        solve will do its own additional substepping on the input.
        
	Sometimes this is not desirable - the solving may be some
        non-temporal effect, such as reinitializing an SDF.  Setting
        this toggle will ensure no substepping is done - the
        intermittent solve will solve at most once.
    Only Once:
	The solver will only trigger when the start time is reached.
	It will ignore the frames and time between
	solves, treating their values at infinity.  This
	is useful if you have some initialization that you only want
	to be performed a single time, regardless of how long the
	simulation runs.
    Use Frame:
        Determines if the frame parameters or the time parameters will
        be used.
    Frames Between Solves:
        The number of frames that should elapse between solves.  Note
        this is in Houdini global frames, not in the simulation
        frames.
    Frame Offset:
        Offset for which frame will trigger the solve.  Note that
        because DOPs solves *to* the *next* frame, this might not line
        up as one expects.

	Say you have a frame offset of 10.  As you step forward, the first
	time you will see the result of your cook will be on frame 11, because
	when cooking to frame 11, frame 10 is reached and surpassed.  This is
	more apparent if you use 4x substepping and move the playbar by 0.25.
	The solve will trigger when cooking to frame 10.25.
    Time Between Solves:
        The amount of time, in seconds, between solves.
    Time Offset:
        The offset to modulate the solve time.
