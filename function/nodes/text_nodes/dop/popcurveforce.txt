= POP Curve Force =

"""A POP node that creates forces generated from a curve."""

The POP Curve Force node applies a force to particles to steer them along, toward, or around a curve.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

NOTE:
	This node creates forces which can cause the particles to get pushed away from the curve and outside the __Max Influence Radius__. For curves with sharp turns or complex shapes, the __Suction Force__ will need to be balanced with the other forces to keep the particles near the curve and under the influence of the Curve Forces.

NOTE:
	For convenience, this node creates an `oncurve` attribute whose value is 1 for particles on the curve and 0 for particles beyond the __Max Influence Radius__. This attribute can be used to influence other forces or to create particle groups.

@parameters

== Curve Force ==
Geometry Source:
        The curve geometry to import.
			
Treat As Wind:
	Rather than treating the computed force as an amount of force to add to the particle's velocity, treat it as a wind speed to be matched by the particle. This causes the particle to be dragged to the goal speed, avoiding overshoot. When this checkbox is enabled, the __Global Falloff From Curve__ will scale the air resistance.
Air Resistance:
	How much particles are to be influenced by this wind field.
Max Influence Radius:
	The maximum distance from the curve where forces will be applied to the particles.

=== Individual Forces ===
  
Follow Scale:
	The amount of force to apply to the particles which will push along the length of the curve, in the direction it was drawn. Negative values will reverse the direction.
Suction Scale:
	The amount of force to apply to the particles which will push them toward the curve itself. Negative values will cause the particles to be pushed away from the curve.
Orbit Scale:
	The amount of force to apply to the particles which will cause them to orbit around the curve. Negative values will cause the direction of the orbit to be reversed.
Inherit Velocity Scale:
	If the curve geometry has a velocity attribute, this parameter controls how much of the curve's velocity will be transferred to the particles.

Scale Radius Along Length:
	This ramp is a scale on the __Max Influence Radius__ and allows the user to vary the distance from the curve where forces will be applied along the length of the curve.
		                     
==== Follow Force Falloff ====
Follow Force Falloff From Curve:
	This ramp controls how the follow force falls off as it moves away from the curve, up to the __Max Influence Radius__.

==== Suction Force Falloff ====
Suction Force Falloff From Curve:
	This ramp controls how the suction force falls off as it moves away from the curve, up to the __Max Influence Radius__.

==== Orbit Force Falloff ====
Orbit Force Falloff From Curve:
	This ramp controls how the orbit force falls off as it moves away from the curve, up to the __Max Influence Radius__.

==== Velocity Force Falloff ====
Incoming Vel Force Falloff From Curve:
	This ramp controls how the inherit velocity force falls off as it moves away from the curve, up to the __Max Influence Radius__.

=== Global Forces ===

Global Force Falloff From Curve:
	This ramp controls the falloff of all forces from the curve up to the __Max Influence Radius__. When the __Treat As Wind__ checkbox is enabled, this force can also be considered the air resistance.

Force Along Length:
	This ramp is a scale on all forces from the curve from the beginning of the curve until the end. 

=== Shaping ===
Resample Curve:
	This checkbox enables resampling of the curve in order to allow the user to control the number of times the curve force is sampled along its length.
Max Segment Length:
	How often the curve should be sampled along its length.

== Guides ==

Show Guide Geometry:
	This checkbox determines whether the curve force guide geometry will be shown in the viewport.
Guide Color: 
	The color of the curve force guide geometry.
Guide Spacing:
	How often to divide the incoming curve when creating the guide geometry. Often, the guide geometry does not need to be as detailed as the curve which is used internally to generate the forces. Lower numbers will give more accurate results.
Show Curve Only:
	This checkbox will adjust the guide geometry to show only the incoming curve without any indication of the __Max Influence Radius__.
