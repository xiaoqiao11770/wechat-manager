"""Applies anticipatory avoidance force to agents/particles to avoid potential future collisions with other agents/particles."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

@parameters

[Include:crowd_steer_parms]

Particle Scale Multiplier:
    The node uses `pscale` as the size of each agent/particle when calculating potential collisions. You can use this parameter to scale the value of `pscale` in the calculation, letting you allow agents/particles to be more or less tightly packed.
    
Force Scale:
    Strength of the avoidance force.

Anticipation Time:
    How far into the future an agent will look for possible collisions (this uses current velocity to project the possible distance). The maximum distance for which an agent considers another agent as a neighbor is the minimum of the agent's current speed multiplied by the Anticipation Time, and the Neighbor Distance. 

Neighbor Distance:
    Maximum distance an agent searches for other agents when determining agent avoidance force.

Max Neighbors:
    Maximum number of nearest neighboring agents to consider for avoidance force calculations.
