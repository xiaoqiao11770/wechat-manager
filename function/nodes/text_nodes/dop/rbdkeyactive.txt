= RBD Keyframe Active =

The RBD Keyframe Active DOP provides an easy way to have an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject]
transition from keyframed animation to simulated animation and back
again. In addition to performing the transition from active to passive
object, this node has parameters to perform the actual position
keyframing.

@parameters

    Active Value:
        #channels: /active

        Sets the active state of the objects. A value of one or more
        indicates the object is active and will be animated
        automatically by the RBD or other Solver attached to the object.
        
        A value less than one indicates the object is passive and will
        use the keyframed Position and Rotation values to update its
        position at each timestep.
        
    Use OBJ Path/OBJ Path:
        Causes the simulated object to get its position information from the specified OBJ node instead of using the __Position__/__Rotate__ parameters.
                
    Position:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        When the object is in passive mode, this parameter sets the
        position of the object in world space. 
        
        Velocity is calculated
        automatically at each timestep using the previous and current
        position values.
        
    Rotation:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        When the object is in passive mode, this parameter controls the
        orientation of the object. 
        
        Angular velocity is calculated
        automatically at each timestep based on the previous and current
        rotation values.
        
    Set Keyframe with Last Simulated Values:
        Pressing this button will copy the current position and
        orientation information for the object into the __Position__ and
        __Rotation__ parameters of this node. 
        
        This makes it easy to do a
        seamless transition from simulated to keyframed positions and
        rotations.
        
    Keyframe Last Values:
        
        Sets a keyframe in the __Position__ and
        __Rotation__ parameters using the current values in the Position data of the DOP object being manipulated.
        
    Blend Simulated Values:
        Specifies a blend factor between the simulated and keyframed values. This is an alternative way to make a smooth transition from simulated to keyframed values. 
        
        Instead of jumping immediately from the last simulated position to a particular keyframed position, this blend factor is used to blend the last simulated position with the keyframed position.
        
    Activation:
        #channels: /activation

        When this value is zero, this node will have no effect on the
        input objects.
    Group:
        #channels: /group

        Only the input objects which match the Group filter will
        be modified.
        
@inputs
    First:
        The RBD Objects whose active state and position information
        will be keyframed.
@outputs
    First:
        The exact same set of objects that feed into the input are sent
        out through the single output.
