= Switch Solver =

The Switch Solver DOP allows simulation objects to be solved by one of
several solvers connected as subdata to the Switch Solver. For each
object, the solver to use is determined by the value of a [Switch
Value|Node:dop/switchvalue] data attached to it. Unlike the [Blend
Solver|Node:dop/blendsolver] or [Multiple Solver|Node:dop/multisolver],
only one of the sub-solvers is applied to each object.

If the selected index is outside the range of solvers, no solver is applied.

NOTE:
	A merge DOP will collapse wires, but will not collapse the solvers into
	a single solver for selecting.  Unlike the [Switch
	DOP|Node:dop/switch], this selects by attached solver, not by attached
	wire. If you have an enable/disable switch one approach is to use the
	__Value Enables All__ option.   Another option is to use
	the simpler [Enable Solver DOP|Node:dop/enablesolver].

@parameters
    Override with Default:
	Uses the default instead of the switch value data attached to the object. This is useful when you want a parameter driven choice in solvers.
    Value Enables All:
	Rather than the value determining which of the attached solvers should
	be executed, it is used as a boolean to determine if any or all are
	executed.  If the value is 0, none of the solvers are evaluated. Otherwise, they are all evaluated in their normal order.
    Switch Value Name:
        #channels: /switchvaluename

        The [Switch Value|Node:dop/switchvalue] data used by the Switch
        Solver can be attached anywhere on the simulation object. 
        
        This parameter tells the solver where to look for the Switch Value
        data. The primary reason for changing this value is if your
        object has multiple Switch Solvers attached to it (one to solve
        [Position|Node:dop/position] data and another to solve Geometry
        data, for example). In that case each Switch Solver would want
        to look for its Switch Value values in a unique location.
    Default Switch Value:
        #channels: /defswitchvalue

        If no [Switch Value|Node:dop/switchvalue] data is found on an
        object, the value in this parameter is used to determine which
        sub-solver to apply to an object.
