= Soft Body (SBD) Pin Constraint =

"""Constrains a point on a soft body object to a certain position."""

This involves constraining some point on the soft body object (wire or cloth) to
a "goal" location derived from animation on the object's geometry, another
simulation object or from a position in world space.

SBD Pin Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

    == Constraint ==

        Constrained Object:
            #channels: /group

            Identifies the soft body object to be constrained.
        Constrained Points:
            #channels: /ptgroup

            Identifies the points in the soft body object to be constrained.
        Constrain To Animation:
            #channels: /useanimation

            Constrains points to animation present on the input geometry.  
            
            The __Use Animated Geometry__ parameter on the constrained object's
            node should be enabled to make the animation available to the DOP
            simulation.
        Goal Object:
            #channels: /goalgroup

            Identifies a soft body object used to determine the goal
            position. 
            
            If this parameter is left blank then the objects
            will be constrained to a world space position.
        Goal Points:
            #channels: /goalpts

            Identifies the points in the goal object to use for the goal
            location.  The goal points are paired with the constrained 
	    points in the order in which they are given.

	    If there are more constrained points than goal points, the 
	    "leftover" points are constrained to the last specified goal
	    point.  "Leftover" goal points will not be used.

            If no points are specified, the initial position of
            the constrained point should be used.
        Goal Location:
            #channels: /goalposx /goalposy /goalposz

            Specifies a location in world space to which the soft body object
            will be constrained.
        Mirror Constraint:
            #channels: /mirror

            If enabled, all objects involved in the constraint will be
            made mutual affectors.
