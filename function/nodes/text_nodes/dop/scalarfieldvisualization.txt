= Scalar Field Visualization =

"""Visualizes a scalar field."""

The Scalar Field Visualization DOP visualizes a Scalar Field data.
The resulting visualization can allow one to determine how a field is
behaving over time, or can even be Object Merged into SOPs to produce
the final output.

@parameters
    Show Guide Geometry:
        Controls if the geometry should be visualized at all.
    Bounding Box:
        Draws a bounding box encompassing the field.
    Bounding Box Hash:
        Adds hash marks along the axes leaving the origin of the
        bounding box marking the divisions between each voxel.  The
        hash marks are drawn larger for every tenth and every
        hundredth.
    Color:
        The color to use in visualization.  The iso surface or smoke
        field will be colored with this color.
    Use Smoke:
        Visualize by creating a volume primitive and treating the
        scalar field's values as density values in smoke.
    Use Plane:
        Visualize by cutting a plane through the scalar field and
        coloring the points on the plane according to the scalar
        field's values.
    Plane Orientation:
        The orientation of the cutting plane for visualization.
    Plane Position:
        Where in space the center of the plane is.  It is always set
        to encompass the scalar field's bounds, so the only relevant
        axis is the one the plane's normal matches.
    Visualization Mode:
        How to convert the range of the scalar field into colors.

        Infra-Red:
            False color is used with blue being 0 and red being 1.
        White to Red:
            White is used for 0 and red is used for 1.
        Grayscale:
            Black is used for 0 and white is used for 1.
        Black Body:
            A black (0) to red to yellow to white (1) ramp is used.
    Specify Range By Min/Max:
            When this checkbox is turned on, use the __Guide Range__ parameter to set the min and max range. When this checkbox is turned off, use the __Guide Range Center__ and __Guide Range Width__ parameters to set the guide range for the center and width of the scalar field.

    Guide Range:
        Before applying the visualization coloring, the given range is
        compressed into the 0..1 range used by the coloring schemes.
        
        Setting this to 3..7 will cause values of 3 to be colored as
        if they were 0 and values of 7 to be colored as if they were
        1.

    Guide Range Center/Width:
        Sets the guide range for the center and width of the scalar field.

    Iso Offset:
        If you are not using smoke or plane visualization, an iso surface will
        be built at this value.
    Invert Iso:
        Inverts the sense of the iso surface. Instead of enclosing
        areas that are less than the iso value, it will enclose areas
        that are greater than the iso value.
