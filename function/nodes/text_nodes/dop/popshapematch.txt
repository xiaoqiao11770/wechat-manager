= POP Shape Match =

""" Defines the parameters to be used to match a particle system with a target shape. """

The POP Shape Match DOP defines parameters for how a particle system should be matched to a rest shape. Each point in the geometry attached as Geometry to this data is used as the goal position for each corresponding point in the particle system.

The matching process ignores rigid transformations. This means it can be used to mimic certain softbody effects.


@parameters
    Restoration Strength:
        Controls how quickly the points will move to their rest positions. A low value will only slowly try to restore the rest shape, while a large enough value makes the object almost rigid.

        This is the multiplier to move the points towards their goal positions in a single step. Higher numbers will result in a faster restoration of the base state. 

	NOTE:
		Values greater than the frame rate will be clamped to ensure stability.

    Squash Resistance:
        Controls how much the group of points will be restored from squashing effects. Lower values let the object become squashed into a pancake, while higher values will always try to keep the object in its original dimensions. In any case, volume is preserved by applying a stretch to the non-squashed direction.

        In addition to purely rigid transforms, the shape matching may also discard squash/stretch transforms. The Squash Resistance is the amount to restore the goal to a rigid state in one second. It is clamped to the frame rate.

    Frame Drag Strength:
        Acts as a damping effect on the simulation.

        The restoration of the goal shape uses spring-like forces. This would result in oscillation of displaced points. The Frame Drag will apply a drag force with respect to how they are not obeying rigid motion. This cancels out these oscillations without slowing the entire object down.
