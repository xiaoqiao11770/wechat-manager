"""Apply force to agents/particles to move them apart from each other."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

@parameters

[Include:crowd_steer_parms]

Force Scale:
    Strength of the separation force.

Braking Force:
	Maximum force to use to slow down the agents/particles that are getting too close to neighbors.

[Include:crowd_fov_parms]
    
Force Separation:
	Force the agent/particles to be separated if the force scale is not enough.
