"""A microsolver that dissipates a field."""

The Gas Dissipate DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Dissipate DOP performs several types of dissipation on the
specified field.  This will drive the fields value to zero,
causing the smoke to disappear over time.  An optional control field
can be used to affect when the dissipation occurs.  Using the heat
field for a control, if the solver is set to add the heat field, will
allow having dissipation be dependent on how long since the smoke was
added to the simulation.

@parameters

Field:
    The field to dissipate. This is a single scalar field.

Control Field:
    The field to use for looking up in the ramps.  This is a
    single scalar field.  If it is the heat field, it can be
    thought of as measuring the time since a voxel was added to
    the simulation.
    
Diffusion:
    A fixed diffusion of the field in all directions.  This is a
    time based blurring effect.
    
Evaporation Rate:
    The rate at which the field will be reduced. An evaporation of 0.1 means 10% of the field will be lost in one second. The __Evaporation Rate__ is a multiplicative factor which acts as a sort of half life for the smoke. The rate is what % of smoke should disappear after 1 second. So a rate of 1 means all the smoke disappears in a second, which for a halflife effect means it disappears immediately. 0 means no effect. 0.5 means that after 1 second you have 50% of the smoke left you did at the start.

    Since this uses multiplication to achieve its effect over one second, the per frame action may be a lot less than expected. A value of 0.75, which removes 75% of the field over one second, only removes 5.6% of the field every frame at 24 FPS. This compounds over the 24 frames to get the final desired 75% removal. 

    NOTE: 
        __Evaporation Rate__ and __Evaporate by Subtraction__ do not work together, they layer on top of each other.

Evaporate by Subtraction:
    Evaporation uses a multiplicative process which tails smoothly to zero. You may want a harsher linear reduction on smoke values. This is done by subtracting a fixed amount from the field proportional to the timestep. The given subtraction amount will be subtracted every second. The ramp will be multiplied by the subtraction amount to give a per-voxel control of the subtraction rate dependent on the control volume. 

    Subtraction, as the name suggests, just subtracts the subtraction amount times the timestep away from all the density every timestep. So a value of 0.1 means that 0.1 of density will be lost per voxel every second.

    NOTE:
        __Evaporation Rate__ and __Evaporate by Subtraction__ do not work together, they layer on top of each other.

Scale Evaporation Rate by Control:
    The specified evaporation will be multiplied by this ramp
    value.  This allows one to turn on evaporation on cooler or
    older smoke by tying it to a control field.
    
Clamp To Minimum:
    The field is clamped from below by this value.  This can
    ensure the evaporate by subtraction option does not create a
    negative field.
    
Clamp To Maximum:
    A per voxel maximum is calculated using the control field.
    This is then multiplied by the maximum value to get a clamp to
    clamp the maximum of the field.
    
Remap Control Field:
    The ramps all expect a control field in the 0 to 1 range, with
    0 meaning the left hand of the ramp and 1 meaning the right
    hand.  However, heat and temperature fields are 1 when first
    created and decay to 0 over time, and since one often expects
    the right side to control the "older" smoke, the default
    mapping has been reversed here. The range can also be
    adjusted for other control fields.
