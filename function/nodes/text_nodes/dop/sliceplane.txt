= Slice by Plane =

"""Specifies a cutting plane to divide a particle system into two
slices for distributed simulations.
"""

The Slice by Plane DOP specifies a cutting plane that will divide a
particle system into two.  This is used when distributing particles
across multiple computers to define which region of space is handled
by each machine.

If a slice by plane is a child data of another slice by plane, it will
subdivide only one of the slices of the parent.  Which of the parent's
slices it divides will be determined by where the center of the child
slice by plane is.  Slice by Planes that live at the same level in the
data hierarchy will take the product of their divisions.  Ie, two
slice by planes will create 4 slices, and three will create 8 slices.

@parameters
    Direction:
        The direction of the cutting plane.
    Position:
        The simulation space position for the center of the cutting
	plane.
