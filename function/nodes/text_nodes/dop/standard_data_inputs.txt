#type: include
First Input:
    This optional input can be used to control which simulation objects
    are modified by this node. Any objects connected through this input
    and which match the __Group__ parameter field will be modified. 
    
    If this input is not connected, this node can be used in conjunction with an
    Apply Data node, or can be used as an input to another data node.
All Other Inputs:
    If this node has more input connectors, other data nodes can be
    attached to act as modifiers for the data created by this node. 
    
    The specific types of subdata that are meaningful vary from node to
    node. Click ((MMB)) an input connector to see a list of available
    data nodes that can be meaningfully attached.
