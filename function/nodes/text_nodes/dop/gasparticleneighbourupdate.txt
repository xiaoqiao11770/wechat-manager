= Gas Particle Neighbour Update =

""" Updates a neighbourhood list for Geometry to match moved points. """

The Gas Particle Neighbour Update updates a neighbourhood list attached to
particle geometry.  The neighbour list stores all particles with overlapping
pscales, allowing for later operations to do faster neighbour lookups.  
This data must be explicitly updated with this micro solver, because this data isn't automatically rebuilt when particles move (since neighbours often remain the same).

@parameters

    Neighbour Data:
	The name of the data to store the neighbour list into.  This will be
	attached as subdata to the geometry.

    Particles:
	The Geometry data to recompute the neighbour list for.
