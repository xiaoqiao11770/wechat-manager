= Rendering Parameters Volatile =

The Rendering Parameters Volatile DOP provides some control over the
display of simulation object geometry in the viewport and when
rendering. It also allows a SHOP node to be specified for use with a
simulation object when rendering the DOP Network directly. This level
of control is only sufficient for performing test renders of a
simulation. 

For full control over the rendering of a DOP simulation it
is recommended that the simulation data be extracted to a Geometry
Object using an [Object Merge SOP|Node:sop/object_merge]. From there all the standard
rendering controls and options will be available.

This data should be attached as subdata to Geometry data as each
Rendering Parameters data affects only a single piece of Geometry. As
such, it can be used to hide some geometry attached to an object while
exposing others. The [Ground Plane DOP|Node:dop/groundplane] uses this technique to provide one
piece of geometry for display in the viewport, but a different piece of
geometry for use in collision detection.

The Rendering Parameters Volatile DOP differs from the Rendering
Parameters DOP in that the current value is evaluated from the channel
on the node that created the data, not from the value stored in the
simulation.  This means attempts to query from inside the simulation
might not return the expected results.  However, it also means that
objects can be displayed or hidden without recooking the simulation,
so is often good for controlling the display of proxy geometry, for
example.


@parameters
    Surface SHOP:
        #channels: /surfaceshop

        The SHOP Node to use when rendering the DOP Network directly,
        rather than through an Objet Merge SOP. 
        
        This SHOP value is not
        attached to the geometry directly so this setting is not
        preserved when extracting geometry from the simulation.
    Display:
        #channels: /display

        The Geometry data to which this data is attached will be
        displayed in the viewport if this option is turned on. 
        
        If no
        Rendering Parameter data is attached to Geometry data, it will
        only be displayed in the viewport if it is attached to a
        simulation object with the name `Geometry`.
    Render:
        #channels: /render

        The Geometry data to which this data is attached will be
        rendered if this option is turned on. 
        
        If no Rendering Parameter
        data is attached to Geometry data, it will only be rendered if
        it is attached to a simulation object with the name `Geometry`.
