"""A microsolver that computes pairwise fluid pressure forces between
particles in a fluid simulation."""

The Gas Particle Pressure DOP is a microsolver used to build larger
fluid simulations. It is currently used to compute pressure forces in
the [Particle
Fluid Solver DOP|Node:dop/particlefluidsolver]. It computes and optionally applies
pairwise pressure forces between particles.

To apply pressure forces, this DOP computes the density of the
particle field at each particle position, and applies a force that
attempts to return the particle to its rest density. The force pulls
particles together when their density drops below their rest density,
and pushes them apart when their density rises above their rest density.


@parameters
    Geometry:
        The geometry containing the particle set for which pressure
        forces are to be computed.
    Enable Pressure Force:
        Enables or disables pressure forces applied by this DOP.
    Gas Constant:
        Controls the magnitude of the pressure forces applied by this
        DOP.
    Repulsion Strength:
        Controls the strength of an additional force which acts only to
        push particles apart. This parameter specifies a multiplier
        relative to the the standard pressure force. 

	For example, if
        this parameter is set to 10, then a force potentially 10 times
        as large as the basic attractive/repulsive pressure force is
        applied to push particles apart. This can be used to reduce
        compressibility for more liquid-like behavior.
    Compute New Velocity:
        When this option is enabled, the DOP computes forces acting
        between particles and directly modifies the velocity attribute
        of the affected particles. If it is not, the DOP simply places
        the computed forces in the force attribute of the particles.
