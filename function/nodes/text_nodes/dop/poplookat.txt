= POP Lookat =

"""A POP node makes a particle look at a point."""

The POP Lookat node reorients a particle to look at a given point or direction.

This operator modifies the `orient`, `torque`, `targetw`, and `spinresist` attributes.

@parameters
    [Include:standard_pop_parms#commonMain/]

    == Target ==

	Mode:
	    The target can be either specified as a position in space to look at or a direction to look in.  In both cases, the z-axis of the particle will be reoriented to face that
	    point or direction.
	Target:
	    The goal for the particle to look in.
	Reference Direction:
	    The particle axis which will be aligned to the look at direction.  For example, setting this to 1,0,0 will align the particle's X-axis to the look at target.
	Reference Object:
	    The object that determines the space of the target position.  If
	    your target position is 0,0,0, the particle will look at the center
	    of this object.
	Use Up Vector:
	    Allows you to disable use of the up vector.  This allows the particle to rotate in a shorter direction to the target facing, but it might not maintain the same sense of up.
	Up:
	    The up vector with which the particle should align.  Will be overridden by an `up` attribute.
	Reference Up:
	    The original up vector of the particle.  This parameter can be used with __Reference Direction__ to set an alternate reference frame for the particle before it is aligned to the look at target.
	Method:
	    How to re-orient:

	    Immediate:
		Instantaneously face the desired orientation.  Useful for initializing orientations, but jerky if applied in animation.
	    Turn:
		Re-orient the particle but cap the total it can spin to a maximum number of degrees per second.  Useful for spinning a particle to an orientation precisely without worrying about overshoot.
	    Spin:
		Applies a torque on the particle for it to spin into the desired direction.  You will likely want to add a [Spin Drag POP|Node:dop/popspindrag] to compensate.
	Degrees Per Second:
	    How fast, in degrees per second, that the particle should reorient.

	    NOTE:
	        There is no physics in this reorientation, so there is no overshoot or acceleration.

	Torque Scale:
	    A scalar for how quickly to accelerate when spinning into the desired orientation.  This will use physics, so will overshoot.  You will want to add a [Spin Drag POP|Node:dop/popspindrag] to avoid oscillating forever if __Treat as Wind__ is disabled.
