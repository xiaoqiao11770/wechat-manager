= POP Metball Force =

"""A POP node that applies forces according to metaballs."""

The POP Metaball Force node applies a force to particles according to how close they are to metaballs.

The metaballs must be set up with force attributes using the [Force SOP|Node:sop/force].
Particles within range of the metaballs will be influenced by them, scaled by the weight of the metaball.

This operator modifies the `force` attribute.

== Parameters ==

    [Include:standard_pop_parms#geoSourceParms/]

    Force Scale:
	The metaball's force scales will be scaled by this factor, which allows you to then have different particles react differently. A positive value will attract particles and a negative value will repel particles.
