= ODE Solver =

""" Sets and configures an ODE Dynamics solver. """

The ODE Solver DOP sets objects to use the ODE Dynamics solver.

This solver uses a simplified representation of the object, such as a
box, sphere, or tube, to allow for faster dynamics calculations.

NOTE:
    This solver does not support cylinder-cylinder and cylinder-capsule collisions.

WARNING:
    The ODE Solver does not support scaling at the object level.
