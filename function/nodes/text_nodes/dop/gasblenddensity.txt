"""A microsolver that blends the density of two fields."""

The Gas Equalize Density DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, advanced users may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Blend Density DOP blends a density field into a goal field.
It tries to blur the behavior, so that it looks more like
the density field sharpens into the goal field rather than a pure
linear interpolation.

@parameters
    Blend Amount:
	The speed at which the fields blend.  A higher value will
	cause them to blend faster but will make the transition look sharp, rather than a subtle blend.
    Blend Distance:
	How far apart the density and goal fields will influence each
	other.  Beyond this distance no blending will occur.
    Blending Blur:
	The actual blend effect is blurred by this amount.  This
	avoids sharp lines in the goal field from immediately showing
	up in the density field.  For the final stages of a blend one
	may want to tighten this up.

    Fields:
	These parameters control what name will be used for the input
	fields and the internal fields.

	Density Field:
	    The field to blend into the goal.
	Density Blur Field:
	    A blurred version of the density field.
	Goal Field:
	    The target field which density will be blended towards.
	Goal Blur Field:
	    A blurred version of the goal field.
	Error Field:
	    The blurred difference between density and goal.
