"""Lets you paint capture attributes directly onto geometry."""

Capture Layer Paint is a specialized paint operation for painting
capture attributes.

[Include:/shelf/paintcapturelayer#includeme]

@parameters
    Capture Type:
        #channels: /capturetype

        The type of capture (the attribute) to modify.

        Bone:
            Modify the `boneCapture` point attribute when painting.
        Metaball:
            Modify the `metaCapture` point attribute when painting.

    == Operation ==

        Group:
            #channels: /group

            Specifies a subset of points to affect. If this is blank,
            all points are affected.
        Group Type:
            #channels: /grouptype

            The type of geometry to use in the group. If the group has
            only one type of geometry (for example, points), you can
            just use "Guess from group" and Houdini will figure out the
            geometry type from the contents of the group.
        Operation:
            #channels: /op

            The operation used by Apply To All.
        Default Skeleton Root Path:
            #channels: /skelrootpath

            Default prefix applied to capture region paths if none is
            supplied by the geometry.
        Capture Region:
            #channels: /cregion

            The capture region to paint.
        Maximum Paint Value:
            #channels: /maxpaint

            The maximum value of a capture weight that can be reached in
            the layer using the paint operation.
        Minimum Reduce Value:
            #channels: /minreduce

            The minimum value of a capture weight that can be reached in
            the layer using the reduce operation.
        Apply To All:
            #channels: /flood

            Applies the operation to all of the selected geometry.
        Reset All Changes:
            #channels: /clearall

            Restores the geometry to its initial state.
        Flatten Layers:
            #channels: /flatten

            Updates the layer to contain a snapshot of the current
            capture weights.
        Visualize Attribute:
            #channels: /visualize

            Whether to visualize the capture weights by coloring the
            geometry.
        Visualize Normalized Weights:
            #channels: /visnormal

            Indicates the visualized weight values should be
            normalized.
        Visualize Layer:
            #channels: /vislayer

            Whether to visualize the weights in the layer or the result
            after compositing.
        Visualize:
            #channels: /vistype

            Whether to visualize weights for the selected capture region
            or all capture regions.
        Visualize Mode:
            #channels: /vismode

            For single bone, how to map the weight to a color.
