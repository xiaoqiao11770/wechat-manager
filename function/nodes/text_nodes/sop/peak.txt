= Peak =

"""Moves primitives, points, edges or breakpoints along their normals."""

The Peak operation translates primitives, points, edges or breakpoints
along each of their normals. If no group is specified, all the points
are translated along their normals.

When using primitives, the points are translated along the average
normal of their primitives. This differs from translating along the
points' normal because only primitives specified in the group are
considered and the points normal attribute is ignored.


@parameters
    Group:
        Primitives, points, edges or breakpoints to translate.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the group field.
    Distance:
        #channels: /dist

        The translation distance.
    Recompute Point Normals:
        Recomputes point normals if they exist.
@locals
    NPT:
        The number of points.
    NPR:
        The number of primitives.
