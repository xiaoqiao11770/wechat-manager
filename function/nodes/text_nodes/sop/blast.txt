"""Deletes primitives, points, edges or breakpoints."""

Blast is designed to remove geometry that you select interactively in the viewport, as opposed to [Icon:COMMON/delete][Delete|Node:sop/delete] which is a more procedural tool.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of the input geometry to delete.

    Group Type:
        The type of the specified group.  If this is not __Guess from group__,
        the group must be the indicated type.

        Guess from group:
            Infer which type of group is specified based on the contents
            of the group.
        Breakpoints:
            Delete points affecting NURBS breakpoints in the specified breakpoint group.
        Edges:
            Delete points used by the specified edge group.
        Points:
            Delete points in the specified point group.
        Primitives:
            Delete primitives in the specified primitive group.

    Recompute Normals:
	The removal of geometry can change the effective normals on
	the surface.  This option will recompute any point normals to
	ensure they reflect the result of the deletion.

    Delete Non Selected:
	Negates the sense of the selection.  Instead of deleting
	anything selected, will delete anything not selected.  This is
	very useful to isolate some geometry.

	Note that Breakpoints groups cannot be inverted with this
	toggle.
    
    Fill Simple Holes:
	Caps complete holes that result from the deletion of points. A hole
	is said to be complete if it is a negative polygon i.e it has borders.
	This option works only with non-manifold geometry. After capping, it
	removes degenearate polygons that are formed during the deletion.

	Fill simple holes is only enabled when point groups are used for
	deletion.

    Delete Unused Groups:
	Remove any groups that are left empty after deleting
	points/primitives.
