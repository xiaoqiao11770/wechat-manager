= Volume Ramp =

"""Remaps a volume according to a ramp."""

The Volume Ramp SOP uses a volume as a key to lookup values in a ramp
to generate a new volume of the same resolution and size.  It can
either use a scalar ramp that ramps one volume to one volume, or a
color ramp to generate three volumes according to the red, green, and
blue values of the ramp.

To generate a color field that will be understood by Mantra, set New
Name to "Cd" to generate Cd.x, Cd.y, and Cd.z volumes that
will override the shader's color value.

@parameters

    Volume Primitive:
	Which primitive number in the input should be remapped.
    New Name:
	If not blank, the name attribute of the volume will be changed
	to match this name.  If a color ramp is used, .x through .z
	will be appended.
    Source Min, Source Max:
	The range of values to map from in the input volume.  Any
	value less than the source min will be clamped to the left
	hand side of the ramp, anything greater than source max to the
	right hand side of the ramp.
    Dest Min, Dest Max:
	The vertical range of the scalar ramp and the color range of
	the color ramp both default to a 0..1 range.  This allows you
	to remap them to a larger range.  Values outside of the 0..1
	range on the ramp will be clamped to 0..1 before this
	remapping is applied.
    Use Color Ramp:
	Determines if the scalar ramp or color ramp will be used to
	look up values from.
    Scalar Ramp:
	The scalar ramp to use for mapping.
    Color Ramp:
	The color ramp to use for mapping.
