= Whitewater Source =

"""Generates emission particles and volumes to be used as sources in a Whitewater simulation."""

The Whitewater Source SOP generates emission particles and surface
and velocity volumes to be used as input to the 
[Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver].
It calculates emission probabilities by analyzing the input particles and 
volumes according to several criteria, choosing the maximum probability for
each candidate particle.  The probability of each particle emitting
whitewater is stored in its `emit` attribute.  All particles with 
non-zero emission probability are put in the `emitters` group, and 
non-emitting particles are deleted.

Input to this SOP will often be the output of a FLIP simulation, including
particles, a Signed Distance volume named `surface` that represents the
liquid, and three velocity volumes named `vel.x`, `vel.y`, and `vel.z` 
containing the velocity values from the input fluid simulation.

Input can also consist of only particles from a Particle Fluid simulation
or another simulation package, in which case this SOP can generate
compatible volumes. Conversely, it can take surface and velocity volumes from
the Liquid Solver or another volume-based liquid simulation and generate
emission particles.

== Tips == (tips)

* If the source fluid simulation is cached to disk or memory, this SOP allows
  quick preview and tuning of whitewater emission particles throughout the
  frame range of the source simulation. Choosing 
  [Hide Other Objects|/basics/view] in the Scene Viewer can ensure no 
  simulations solve in the background when scrubbing frames.

* If the input particles have been packed using the [Fluid Compress|Node:sop/fluidcompress]
  or [Pack Points|Node:sop/packpoints] SOPs and are being read from disk files, ensure that
  __Delay Load Geometry__ is enabled on the [File|Node:sop/file] or [File Cache|Node:sop/file]
  SOP used to read them in. With this setup, particles won't actually load from disk until
  needed for emission, saving load time if using __Distribution__ to divide emission into regions.
  
:task:Create swirls of bubbles underneath the surface:
    Turn on __Reseed Compressed Fluid__ on the [Whitewater Source SOP|Node:sop/whitewatersource]. This will create new particles under the specified particle bandwidth to use as potential whitewater emitters.
        
:task:Only emit whitewater at the surface:
    Turn on __Limit By Depth__ on the [Whitewater Source SOP|Node:sop/whitewatersource]. This will limit whitewater emission to particles with a certain depth range within the surface SDF.  Alternatively, because FLIP compression already culls particles deep below the surface, it can often be effective (and faster) to simply turn off __Reseed Compressed Fluid__.
    
:task:Only emit whitewater in a particular region:
    Change the __Division Type__ to __Specified Box__ on the __Divisions__ tab of the [Whitewater Source SOP|Node:sop/whitewatersource]. This will only load whitewater in the specific slice.



== Advanced Tips == (advancedtips)

When fine-tuning emission criteria or generating whitewater for very large
liquid simulations, it is important to understand the multiple stages of this
node's operation:

* _Culling_ the input particles based on __Min Speed__ and __Distribution__
  settings.

* _Sampling_ the emission criteria from the input volumes into attributes on
  the culled points.

* _Mapping_ the sampled attribute values onto their emission values, with
  the final emission probability being the maximum of all emission values.

* _Visualization_ of the attribute or emission values for any criterion.

* _Grouping_ emitting particles into the `emitters` group and culling
  any non-emitting particles.

Enabling parameters such as __Keep Curvature Attributes__ allows inspecting the
sampled attribute values directly in the
[Geometry Spreadsheet|/ref/panes/geosheet] to determine good ranges for mapping
to emission probability.

The __Cache__ tab allows caching the candidate emission points to file after the
_Culling_ and _Sampling_ stages.  At this point there are typically far
fewer candidate points and the input volumes no longer need to be sampled,
so fine-tuning only _Mapping_ stage parameters such as __Min Accleration__
will be much faster.  

@inputs
    Liquid Simulation:
        Particles and / or surface and velocity volumes or VDBs from a liquid 
        simulation.

    Liquid Simulation Volumes:
        Surface and velocity volumes or VDBS from a liquid simulation.

@parameters

== Emission == (emission)

Particles will only emit whitewater when they have sufficient speed and,
optionally, are within a specified surface depth range. The maximum value
from all other criteria is taken, then the particle's emission probability
is fit to a 0-1 range based on its speed.

Min Speed:
    The minimum speed at which a particle can emit whitewater.

Max Speed:
    The maximum speed at which a particle can emit whitewater.

Reseed Compressed Fluid:
    If the input fluid simulation has been compressed with the 
    [Fluid Compress SOP|Node:sop/fluidcompress], automatically reseed
    potential emitter points below its specified particle __Cull Bandwidth__.
    Disabling this option will speed up emission and avoid creating emitters
    deep within the liquid, which is sometimes preferable.  The density
    of the reseeded particles is controlled by the __Particle Separation__
    parameter on the __Sources__ tab.  

Limit By Depth:
    Limit whitewater emission to particles with a certain depth range
    within the surface SDF.

Min Depth:
    The minimum depth at which a particle can emit whitewater.

Max Depth:
    The maximum depth at which a particle can emit whitewater.

Output Points Only:
    Do not include input volumes in the output of this node.

Keep Non-Emitting Points:
    Do not cull points with zero emission probability.  This is mostly useful
    for inspecting sampled attribute values.

Remap Speed:
    Remap the speed curve from a linear mapping to a specific curve.

Speed Ramp:
    The ramp for remapping speed.

Remap Emission:
    Apply a global ramp to the emission probability after all other criteria
    have been applied.

Emission Ramp:
    The ramp for remapping emission.

Visualize Emission:
    Visualize the emission probability of each source particle as
    color.

Emission Color Ramp:
    The ramp for mapping emission probability to color.

== Curvature == (curvature)

Emit From Curvature:
    Create emission particles based on the curvature of the surface SDF, which
    can be an effective criteria for detecting the leading edge of breaking
    waves.

Keep Curvature Attributes:
    Retain the `curvature`, `velocityangle`, and `curvatureemit` attributes
    sampled when __Emit From Curvature__ is enabled.  This option is useful for
    inspecting the raw curvature values to determine good settings for
    the mapping parameters below.

Min Curvature:
    The minimum surface curvature at which to emit whitewater.

Max Curvature:
    The maximum surface curvature at which to emit whitewater.

Max Velocity Angle:
    The angle between the velocity of the particle and the surface normal must
    be lower than this value for whitewater emission. This limit helps ensure
    that whitewater is only created on the leading edges of waves.

Remap Curvature:
    Remap the curvature emission probability from a linear mapping to
    a specific curve.

Visualize:
    #channels: /vizcurvature
    Visualize the sampled attribute values or emission probability from
    curvature.

Curvature Ramp:
    The ramp for remapping curvature.

== Acceleration == (acceleration)

Emit From Acceleration:
    Create emission particles based on the magnitude of the acceleration
    occurring at a particle's position within the velocity volumes.  This
    value is calculated by comparing the particle velocity to the velocity at
    that point in the velocity volumes time-shifted by one previous frame.
    Acceleration is effective at detecting areas when particles are rejoining
    existing parts of the fluid, resulting in trapped air that causes
    whitewater.

Keep Acceleration Attributes:
    Retain the `acceleration` and `accelerationemit` attributes sampled
    when __Emit From Acceleration__ is enabled.  This option is useful for
    inspecting the raw acceleration values to determine good settings for
    the mapping parameters below.

Min Acceleration:
    The minimum acceleration magnitude at which to emit whitewater.

Max Acceleration:
    The maximum acceleration magnitude at which to emit whitewater.

Remap Acceleration:
    Remap the acceleration emission probability from a linear mapping
    to a specific curve.

Acceleration Ramp:
    The ramp for remapping acceleration.

Visualize:
    #channels: /vizaccel
    Visualize the sampled attribute values or emission probability from
    acceleration.

== Vorticity == (vorticity)

Emit From Vorticity:
    Create emission particles based on the the vorticity, or magnitude of
    rotation, within the velocity volumes.  This criterion can be effective in
    identifying churning areas of the fluid, which generally occur deeper
    below the surface.

Keep Vorticity Attributes:
    Retain the `vorticity` and `vorticityemit` attributes sampled
    when __Emit From Vorticity__ is enabled.  This option is useful for
    inspecting the raw vorticity values to determine good settings for
    the mapping parameters below.

Min Vorticity:
    The minimum vorticity at which to emit whitewater.

Max Vorticity:
    The maximum vorticity at which to emit whitewater.

Remap Vorticity:
    Remap the vorticity emission probability from a linear mapping to
    a specific curve.

Vorticity Ramp:
    The ramp for remapping vorticity.

Visualize:
    #channels: /vizvorticity
    Visualize the sampled attribute values or emission probability from
    vorticity.

== Sources == (sources)

This SOP can modify the input sources before generating emission particles or
generate potential emission points or volumes from the input.

Type:
    Particles and Volumes:
        The input contains particles to use as possible emission points and
        surface and velocity volumes.
    Particles Only:
        The input contains only particles from which to generate surface and
        velocity volumes.
    Volumes Only:
        The input contains only surface and velocity volumes.   Candidate
        emission points will be generated inside the surface volume.
    Particles and VDBs:
        The input contains particles to use as possible emission points, 
        a surface VDB, and a velocity VDB.
    VDBs Only:
        The input contains only surface and velocity VDBs.   Candidate
        emission points will be generated inside the surface VDB.

Volume Division Size:
    The voxel size for generated volumes.

Volume Limit Size:
    The maximum size of generated volumes.

Max Extrapolation:
    The distance outside the surface volume to extrapolate valid
    depth values.  This value should be greater than the sum of the foam
    __Depth__ and __Iso Surface__ parameters of the 
    [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver].

Particle Separation:
    The smallest distance between any two of the generated points 
    in the initial configuration.

Particles Radius Scale:
    Scales the __Particle Separation__ value to calculate a radius
    stored in the `pscale` attribute of generated particles.

Jitter Scale:
    The amount of jitter to apply to the positional values of the 
    generated candidate points.  

Jitter Seed:
    The random seed for the jitter operation.

Rebuild Surface SDF:
    Rebuild the depth values in the surface SDF, up to the distance specified
    by __Max Extrapolation__.  This operation can be useful if the input
    surface volume only has valid depth values for a very narrow bandwidth
    around the zero iso-surface, but the 
    [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] needs depth values 
    farther away from the surface to create a thick foam  layer.

Delete Attributes:
    Delete all specified attributes on the input geometry.

== Distribution == (distribution)

Division Type:
    Divide the input points into multiple regions, allowing the resulting source
    particles to be distributed across multiple machines.  When divisions are
    active the bounding area of the __Current Region__ will be displayed in this
    node's guide geometry.

    None:
        Turn off divisions.
    Specified Box:
        Divide the box specified by the __Box Size__ and __Box Center__ into
        regions according to the __Divisions__ parameter.

        TIP:
            Press ((Enter)) in the Viewport to display a handle for sizing and
            positioning this box.

    particles are packed geometry and loaded with Delay Load Geometry, no
    particles will be loaded from disk outside this region.

Z Near:
    The distance from the camera to start emitting whitewater.

Z Far:
    The distance from the camera to stop emitting whitewater.

Use Camera's Window:
    If set, the camera's window scale, offset, and crop parameters will be
    used in addition to the following __Window X/Y__ settings.

Window X/Y:
    The min/max portions of the camera's view for emission.
    This allows you to add padding to ensure good boundary conditions or focus
    into a key area of the scene.

Divisions:
    The number of regions along each axis.

Current Region:
    Specifies the region to evaluate.  If distributing simulations across
    machines,  this parameter will often be set to a variable like `$SLICE` that
    represents the region for the current job.

== Visualization == (visualization)

Show Surface:
    Show the polygonized surface volume as guide geometry to help visualize
    the whitewater emission in the context of the source fluid simulation.

Surface Detail:
    Controls the sample rate of the polygon conversion for the 
    guide surface volume.

These parameters allow caching the candidate points after sampling the
volumes into attribute values, but before mapping to final emission
probability.
