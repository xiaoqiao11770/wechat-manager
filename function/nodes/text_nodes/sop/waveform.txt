= Waveform =

"""Creates a waveform shape out of surface geometry"""

This operator is used to generate a wave shape oriented in the XZ-plane.  
The orientation and shape of the wave can be controlled directly, 
while the waveform's resolution corresponds to the detail of the geometry 
to which it is applied.

A wave created by this operator can be used to create a moving wave in a 
Particle Fluid.  To make this possible, enable __Output Wave Velocity 
Attributes__ and perform a [Finalize Waves|Node:sop/finalizewaves] operation
on the object containing the wave.

@parameters
    Height:
	#channels: /H

	The height of the wave.
    Wavelength:
	#channels: /d

	The length of the wave, relative to the height.
    Width:
	#channels: /width
	
	The distance from the center along the wave axis the wave will be applied
    Gravity:
	#channels: /g

	The gravity that the wave will be subjected to.
    Position:
	#channels: /t{xyz}

	The center of the waveform.
    Rotation:
	#channels: /r{xyz}

	The orientation of the waveform in the XZ-plane.
    Output Wave Velocity Attributes:
	#channels: /output_attrib

	Enabling this option will allow a subsequent Finalize Waves operator
	to properly given particle velocities to points inside the wave.
	NOTE:
	    If this Waveform will be part of a Particle Fluid object, this
	    option should be enabled, and a Finalize Waves operator should
	    be used before the creation of the Particle Fluid.
    Falloff Type:
	Controls how the wave decreases in intensity the farther the surface gets from the wave center.

	None: 
	    The wave is the same intensity, regardless of how far away it is from the wave center.

	Linear:
	    A linear falloff of intensity of the wave between the minimum and maximum distances from the wave center.


	Quadratic:
	    This is a general form of falloff.  Three coefficients are specified to create a quadratic equation.

	    C = Constant coefficient L = Linear coefficient Q = Quadratic coefficient

                The mathematics of this model are represented by

                Cl = 1 / ( C + L*D + Q*D*D)

    Min:
	Mininum distance from the wave center to start the falloff.
    Max:
	Maximum distance from the wave center to falloff to.

    Constant Coefficient:
	_C_ in the falloff formula (see above).
    Linear Coefficient:
	_L_ in the falloff formula (see above).
    Quadratic Coefficient:
	_Q_ in the falloff formula (see above).
