"""Verify that a bsdf conforms to the required interface."""

This node provides some useful checks and balances that can be used to
verify whether a `cvex_bsdf` conforms to the required interface. It works
by randomly sampling and evaluating the bsdf with point samples, and will
additionally show a visualization of the shape of the bsdf as a point
cloud.

By default, the Hair BSDF's `R` component is used. Modify
the `verify_bsdf` [VOP SOP|Node:sop/vopsop] inside this node to change
the BSDF.

For more information on how to verify a BSDF with this node, refer to the sticky notes inside this node.
            
@parameters
