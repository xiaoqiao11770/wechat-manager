"""Converts the input geometry into line segments."""

Unlike the [Convert SOP|Node:sop/convert], this node will not copy the unconverted geometry.
Primitive attributes and groups are not preserved.

This replaces the incoming primitives with two-point line segments.  Each
segment connects any point connected in the source.

NOTE:
    Two points will only be connected by a single segment, regardless of the number of connections in the source.

@parameters

Compute Length:
    Computes the length of each resulting line segment and stores
    it in the given attribute.
