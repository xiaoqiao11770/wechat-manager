= Volume Resample =

"""Resamples the voxels of a volume to a new resolution."""

The Volume Resample operation resamples the voxels of a volume to a
new resolution.

This is similar to scaling an image in COPs, so similar filtering
operations are provided.

NOTE:
    The volume bounding box will be unchanged by this operation. This means that unless the new resolution is an integer multiple of the old, the resulting voxels may no longer be square.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be resampled.
    Filter:
        Specifies the type of filter to use when scaling. The __Box__ filter
        is the fastest. The __Gaussian__ is typically the best choice for most uses. __Catmull__ is used when you need something a bit sharper than Gaussian.
    Filter Scale:
	The default scale is set to properly capture the information
	in the original volume.  Increasing this results in a blurring
	effect and decreasing may cause it to start to ignore incoming
	voxel information.

    Specify Exact Resolution:
	The final voxel resolution may either be computed from the
	size of the box or set as a ratio to the incoming resolution.

    Uniform Sampling:
	This parameter controls which axis is divided into __Uniform
	Sampling Divs__.

    Uniform Sampling Divs:
	The number of voxels to divide the __Uniform Sampling__ axis into.
	The other axes will be divided into the number of cells that
	fit for this voxel size.

    Sampling Divs:
	When using non-uniform voxel cells, each dimension's resolution
	can be specified here.

    Div Size:
	The uniform size of the voxels, when specifying the voxel size
	directly.  The given sized box will be filled by voxels of
	this size.

    Resolution Scale:
	The ratio of the original resolution to use.  2.0 will result
	in twice as many voxels in each dimension, for a total of 8
	times the voxels.
