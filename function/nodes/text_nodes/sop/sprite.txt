= Sprite =

"""A SOP node that sets the sprite display for points."""

The Sprite node adds attributes to specify the sprite display of points.

This operator modifies the `spritepath`, `spriteuv`, `spriterot`, and `spritescale` attributes.

NOTE:
    For the sprites to show up in Mantra you should set your object's material
    to the contained Sprite SHOP.

NOTE:
    If no `pscale` attribute is present, the viewport defaults to 1.0 while
    Mantra default to 0.1.  Add a `pscale` attribute to make these systems
    equivalent.

@parameters

Group:
    A subset of points in the input geometry to add sprite attributes to.
    Leave this blank to affect all points in the input.

Sprite SHOP:
    The sprite SHOP to display the sprites with.  This needs to have the proper procedural shader attached.  For convenience, this POP contains a SHOP that can be used.
Sprite Map:
    The texture map to use.  This is linked to the internal SHOP, so it only has effect when the internal SHOP is used. It also cannot be animated per particle. To do so you must either assign a separate Sprite SHOP per particle or use the texture crop on a sprite sheet.

Draw Sprites for:
    By default sprites are only drawn on unconnected points.  This allows 
    them to be mixed with traditional geometry and get the expected
    behavior.  However, you can override this to display sprites on
    all points, even if they are connected to a primitive.

    NOTE:
	This is global to the geometry and does not just affect the
	points in the group!

Texture Crop:
    Controls if the `spriteuv` attribute will be edited.  This attribute handles the cropping of the displayed sprite, allowing you to select different sprites on a sheet.
Mode:
    You can specify the crop region by an offset/size in 0..1 UV space, or by treating it as a tiled array, which you can create using the [Mosaic COP|Node:cop2/mosaic].
Texture Offset:
    Where, in 0..1 coordinates, to start the sprite.
Texture Size:
    How big, in 0..1 coordinates, that the sprite should take up in the texture file.
Sprite Index:
    Which sprite in the sprite sheet to use. This is a linear index that goes over all the sprites in row/column order.
Rows and Columns:
    How many sprites are in the sheet.
Rotate:
    Rotates the displayed sprite around the view axis.  Measured in degrees.
Sprite Scale:
    Scales the sprite.  Note `pscale` is also used, this is multiplied by the `pscale` and allows anisotropic shapes.

@inputs
    Points to Add Sprites to:
        The geometry to add sprite display attributes to.
