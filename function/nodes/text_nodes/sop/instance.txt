"""Instances Geometry on Points."""

This SOP instances geometry onto the input points.  It creates packed primitives to hold the instanced geometry.  It also collates the instance attribute to minimize in memory copies.

This can be applied to the output of POP simulations that use the [Instance POP|Node:dop/popinstance] to instantiate their geometry for viewing or rendering.

@parameters

Group:
	Points to instance onto.

Instance Attribute:
	String attribute to instance with.  It points to files on disk or op: operator references. 

Display As:
	Allows you to use proxy geometry to reduce the expense of drawing the geometry.

Pack Using Expanded/Absolute File Path:
	Expands the file path when generating packed file primitives, ensuring they will work in .hip sessions started in different locations.

Use Object Transform:
	The relative object transform of the instanced SOP and this object will be baked into the instance operation if this is specified.
