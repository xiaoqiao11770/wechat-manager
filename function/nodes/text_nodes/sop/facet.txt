"""Controls the smoothness of faceting of a surface."""

This node also lets you consolidate points or surface normals.

Facet, like Divide, works as a pipeline to change geometry in stages.
For this reason, Compute Normals appears twice. For example, you can
compute surface normals before making any points shared by different
polygons unique, which gives you the unusual result of smooth shading
and unique point, as the normals get computed while the points are still
shared.

This tool is useful for cleaning up polygons. You can reorient back-facing polygons, remove degenerative polygons, consolidate or unique points, or cusp polygon based on edges.

TIP:
    This op is great for cleaning up geometry read in from _.dxf_ files.
    It corrects flipped normals present in some _.dxf_ files.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of geometry to facet.

Pre-Compute Normals:
    Computes normals based on incoming geometry.

Make Normals Unit Length:
    Resizes the incoming normals to a length of 1.

Unique Points:
    Creates new points for any vertices sharing a point so that
    points will be unshared.

Consolidate:

    No Consolidate:
        Points are not fused together.
    Consolidate Points Slow/Fast:
        Points within a specified distance of each other share a
        point.
    Consolidate Normals Slow/Fast:
        Points within a specified distance of each other have their
        normals averaged.
    
    NOTE:
        The slow versions of consolidation should not be used. They
        are for backwards compatibility only.
        
Distance:
    #id: dist

    Threshold distance for consolidation.

Use Accurate Distance:
    #id: accurate

    Forces Distance to represent consolidate distances accurately,
    and forces consolidation to be performed in order of point
    number, to avoid moving points to within Distance of other points.

Remove Inline Points:
    Remove points from polygons if they lie on the line connecting
    the previous and next point.

Distance:
    #id: inlinedist

    Threshold distance for collinearity.

Orient Polygons:
    Winds all polygons the same direction.

Cusp Polygons:
    Creates hard edges between adjacent sides by uniquing points when the
    edge angle exceeds __Cusp Angle__.  Using a [Normal node|Node:sop/normal]
    to compute vertex normals may be preferable, since uniquing points
    of a watertight mesh will make it no longer watertight.

Cusp Angle:
    #id: angle

    Threshold angle to cusp at.

Remove Degenerate:
    Cleans up any degenerate polygons.
    
Make Planar:
    Flattens each of the polygons so their points lie along a plane.  
    
Post-Compute Normals:
    Computes normals based on result of this operation.

Reverse Normals:
    Reverses the direction of all of the point normals.  Performed
    after all the other computations.
