"""Reads and collates data from disk."""

The output of a distributed DOP simulation is often multiple sequences of
geometry files.  Each frame of the volume or particle simulation is broken into
several files.  The File Merge SOP reassembles these into a single piece of
geometry.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    #id: file

    The name of the file to read.  It is important it has the keyword `$SLICE`
    in its name.  This will be replaced by the merge number, independent of any
    current value of that variable.

    NOTE:   
        This cannot be a channel reference or the `$SLICE` expansion will fail.

Reload Geometry:
    #id: reload

    Force a reload of the file.

Merge Range:
    The `$SLICE` variable in the file name will be replaced by this sequence of
    numbers.  The first is the start, the second the end, and the third the
    increment.  For example, to load files 0..3 from disk, the value should be
    0, 3, 1.

Delete Points from Other Files:
    Particle simulations store a particle slice attribute when distributed.
    Since particles will show up in more than one file, you will get
    duplicate particles if you just merge them all together.  This option will
    delete any particles whose slice attribute doesn't match the
    current merge number.

Missing File:
    What should be done if the specified file does not exist on disk.
    By default, if no file of the given name exists, the SOP will error.  This
    can be troublesome in a network that can recover from the error.  In these
    cases the behavior can be set to __No Geometry__ so only a warning is
    posted.

Load:
    Some file formats, in particular .bgeo and .geo, contain meta-data in the header than can be loaded without loading the entire file. This is useful for dealing with large data sets.
    
    All Geometry:
        Loads the whole file.

    Info:
        Creates one point if the file loads successfully and attach attributes for each named component of the meta-data.

    Info Bounding Box:
        Tries to build a bounding box using the information stored in the header of the file.

Merge Variable:
    The variable name in the __Geometry File__ that will be replaced by
    each number in the __Merge Range__.

Cache Length:
    The number of geometries to cache.  The same File SOP is used internally
    for each of the slices; so this should be a multiple of the number of
    slices.   For example, if merging four slices over ten frames, the
    cache length should be forty.
