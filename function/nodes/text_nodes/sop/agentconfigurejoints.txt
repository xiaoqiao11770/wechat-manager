= Agent Configure Joints =

"""Creates point attributes that specify the rotation limits of an agent's joints."""

The rotation limits are described by a minimum and maximum rotation about each
axis, which forms an elliptical cone within which rotation may take place.

@parameters

    Group:
        The agents to configure joint limits for.

    Joints:
        Joint Limits:
            The number of joint limits to configure.
        Transform Name:
            Specifies which transform in the agent's rig to configure the rotation limit for.
        Parent Transform Name:
            Specifies which transform in the agent's rig the cone should be attached to.
            Typically this should be the parent of the __Transform Name__, but for some rigs another transform (such as the grandparent) may be a more appropriate choice.
        Child Rotation:
            Specifies the rotation of the twist axis, up axis, and out axis in the space of the child transform.
            By default, the twist axis is aligned with the bone.
        Anchor Position:
            The position of the cone in the local space of the parent transform.
        Cone Rotation:
            The orientation of the cone in the local space of the parent transform.
        Twist Rotation Range:
            Specifies the minimum and maximum rotation about the twist axis in degrees.
        Up Rotation Range:
            Specifies the minimum and maximum rotation about the up axis in degrees.
        Out Rotation Range:
            Specifies the minimum and maximum rotation about the out axis in degrees.
    Guides:
        Scale:
            Adjusts the size of the guide geometry.
        Cone Limit Color:
            The color of the guide geometry for the __Up Rotation Range__ and __Out Rotation Range__.
        Twist Limit Color:
            The color of the guide geometry for the __Twist Rotation Range__.
        Twist Axis Color:
            The color of the guide geometry for the child's twist axis.
        Up Axis Color:
            The color of the guide geometry for the child's up axis.
