= Slide Modifier Paint =

"""Lets you paint the slide modifier and inflation modifier attributes
onto geometry interactively."""

The slide modifier attribute is used by the
[Deform Muscle node|Node:sop/deformmuscle]
to determine how much sliding is allowed for each point in the geometry.
This SOP is used to increase or decrease the amount of sliding that
occurs when deforming points in the geometry. The sliding attribute can
take any value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 or less results in no
sliding, while a value of 1 or more results in the maximum level of
sliding.  This node may also be used to paint an inflation modifier
attribute on points in its input geometry.  This attribute is used by
the [Deform Muscle node|Node:sop/deformmuscle] to determine how much
a given point should inflate over underlying muscle geometry.

@parameters

    == Operation ==

        Attribute to Paint:
            The attribute to paint on the input surface.
            Surface Sliding Modifier:
                Painting modifies an attribute controlling how much
                points should slide over their underlying muscle geometry
                when transformed by the [Deform Muscle SOP|Node:sop/deformmuscle].
            Surface Inflation Modifier:
                Painting modifiers an attribute controlling which points
                should inflate over their underlying muscle geometry
                in the [Deform Muscle SOP|Node:sop/deformmuscle].  A value of
                1 on a point indicates that the point should fully inflate
                over underlying muscles.  A value of 0 indicates that no inflation
                should occur, while values in between 0 and 1 blend points
                between their uninflated and fully inflated positions.
                This can be used to control precisely which points in the
                input geometry are inflated by the
                [Deform Muscle node|Node:sop/deformmuscle].
        Operation:
            The operation used by Apply To All.
        Merge Mode:
            How the painted attribute value is to be applied to the
            surface.
        Accumulate To Stencil:
            See  [about accumulate to stencil|/basics/brush] . By
            default, the operation is applied and the stencil cleared
            after every brush stroke. When this option is on, Houdini
            does not apply the stencil until you click __Apply and Clear
            Stencil__.
        Apply & Clear Stencil:
            Applies the operation and clears the stencil. This is
            equivalent to right-clicking in the viewport.
        Apply To All:
            Paints all of the selected geometry.
        Reset All Changes:
            Restores geometry to initial state.
        Visualize Attribute:
            Whether to do a false color visualization of the sliding
            attribute and what range to map to.
        Visualize Mode:
            How to map the attribute value to a color.
