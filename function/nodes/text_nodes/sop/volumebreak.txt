"""Cuts polygonal objects using a signed distance field volume."""

The Volume Break operation cuts polygonal objects using a signed distance field (SDF).  An SDF is a function over space, which evaluates to the signed distance
to the surface of a specified volume.

It can be specified whether to keep the portion of the cut geometry lying
inside or outside the volume, or keep all the geometry.  Additional geometry
may also be generated to close any holes created by the cut.

[Include:no_vdb]

@parameters
    Geometry to Keep:
	Retain the geometry *inside* or *outside* the SDF volume, or *all*.

    Closing Geometry:
	Add geometry to fill in holes created by the cut, or leave them open
	(*do not close*).

	* *Flat*: create one polygon for each hole (may not be planar).

	* *Pyramid*: find an apex point so that the closing geometry is a pointy approximation to the volume.

    Close Polygons:
	If holes are left open, then check this option to close polygons that
	were opened by the cut.  If holes are closed, then polygons are
	automatically closed.
    
    Snapping Tolerance:
	A high tolerance will cause cuts to occur from vertex to vertex, while
	a low tolerance will cause the geometry to be split more accurately by
	introducing new vertices.  To avoid tiny polygons, set the tolerance
	above zero.

    Create Groups:
	Create groups to tell between the output geometry lying inside and
	outside the volume.

    Inside Group:
	Primitive group containing polygons inside the volume.

    Closure:
	Primitive group containing the closing geometry with
	respect to the inside geometry.

    Outside Group:
	Primitive group containing polygons outside the volume.

    Closure:
	Primitive group containing the closing geometry with
	respect to the outside geometry.  The contents are identical to that of
	the first closure group.

@inputs
    Geometry:
        The polygonal geometry to be cut.
    
    Volume:
	    The SDF volume used to cut the geometry.
