"""Places points and primitives into groups based on a user-supplied
rule."""

NOTE:
    This SOP creates a large number of disjoint groups. This is often a very
    inefficient workflow.  Instead, consider creating a single string attribute
    that stores what would be your group name using Attribute Create or
    Attribute Wrangle.  If the string attribute you make was named
    `tag`, you can isolate all the elements named `kiwi` with the
    ad-hoc group `@tag=kiwi`

    To convert a set of disjoint groups, such as created by this SOP,
    into a single string attribute use the Name from Group option
    of the Name SOP.

The Partition SOP places points and primitives into groups based on a
user-supplied rule. For example, in order to put each point in its own
group named `pt_<<pointnumber>>`, enter the rule `pt_$PT`.

The rule can be any valid Houdini expression. Rules should evaluate to
valid group names. The result of a rule may be modified to make it a
valid group name (for example a result of `1` will be turned into the
group `_1`).

Standard local variables are available as well as local variables
created with the Attribute Create SOP.

@locals

[Include:standardvariables]

@parameters

Group:
    The primitives or points considered for the operation.
Entity:
    The type of the entity specified in the group parameter.
Geometry Type:
    The type of primitives to consider for this operation. Only
    applicable when Entity is set to Primitives.
Rule:
    The rule with which to evaluate each primitive or point. The
    result of the rule is the name of the group in which the
    primitive or point will be placed.
