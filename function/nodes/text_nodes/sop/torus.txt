    == Torus ==

        Primitive Type:
            Type of geometry to create.
        Surface Type:
            Type of surface skinning the torus.
        Orientation:
            The plane in which the torus is built.
        Radius:
            #channels: /radx /rady

            First value: The radius of the torus. Second value: The
            radius of the ring.
        Center:
            #channels: /tx /ty /tz

            Offset of torus center from object origin.
	Uniform Scale:
	    #channels: /scale
	    Uniform scaling.
        Rows:
            #channels: /rows

            Number of divisions along the swept shape.
        Columns:
            #channels: /cols

            Number of divisions along the cross-section.
        Imperfect:
            Approximates the surface using non-rational points.

    == Detail ==

        U Order:
            #channels: /orderu

            Order of NURBS/Bezier curve in U direction.
        V Order:
            #channels: /orderv

            Order of NURBS/Bezier curve in V direction.
        U Angle:
            #channels: /beginangleu /endangleu

            The start and end sweep angles of the torus.
        V Angle:
            #channels: /beginanglev /endanglev

            The start and end angles of the cross-section circle that is
            swept to make the torus.
        U Wrap:
            Wraps the surface in the U direction.
        V Wrap:
            Wraps the surface in the V direction.
        U End Cap:
            Puts end-caps on the ends of the torus if it is less than
            360 degrees.
        V End Cap:
            Applies a face between the top and bottom of the torus, if
            it is open.
