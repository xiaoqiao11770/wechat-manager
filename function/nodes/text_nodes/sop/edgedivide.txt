"""Inserts points on the edges of polygons and optionally connects them."""

This node allows you to specify the number of segments you want
in the cut line, and whether or not the new points will be shared by the
coincident edges.

@parameters

Group:
    Space separated list of edges on which to insert points.

    This field will usually be filled in automatically when you use
    this operator in the viewer. However, you can also specify edges
    manually using the format `p<<a>>-<<b>>`, where <<a>> and <<b>> are
    point numbers with a common edge.

Divisions:
    #id: numdivs

    The number of segments resulting from the original edge.
    
Apply To All Coincident Edges:
    #id: applytoall

    If the edge is specified by primitive, this option toggles
    between whether or not the edge division will apply to all the
    edges that share the points. If the edge is specified by points,
    this option has no effect.
    
Share New Points:
    #id: sharedpoints

    Toggles whether or not each coincident edge will get its own
    points, or if they will all share the new points.
    
Connect Points:
    #id: connectpoints

    Toggles whether or not the new points should be connected. The
    points are connected in the order that the edges are specified.
    
Close Path:
    #id: closepath

    Toggles whether or not the path traced out by the connected
    points should be closed. When a path is closed, the point on the
    last edge is connected to the point on the first edge. Since the
    connections are done with a minimum distance criteria, to get
    the desired results, the length of the path from the first edge
    to last edge should be smaller than the length of the rest of
    the path.
    
Tolerance:
    Tolerance used when performing geometric calculations.
