= Volume FFT =

"""Compute the Fast Fourier Transform of volumes."""

The Volume FFT SOP computes the forward or inverse Fast Fourier Transform
of input volumes.  The volumes should be specified in pairs, representing
the real and imaginary parts of complex number input and output.

TIP:
	For best performance, volume resolutions should be a power of two.

	To take the forward FFT of a typical real-valued volume, an empty volume of the
	same resolution should be provided as the zero-valued imaginary input, and to
	hold the imaginary spectral output.

	Using the `name` attribute is an effective way of specifying pairs of volumes 
	in the __Source Group__ parameter, e.g. `@name=X_real @name=X_imag @name=Y_real @name=Y_imag`.

	Enabling __Center DC__ to shift the DC component to the center allows easier visualization of spectra with the [Volume Slice|volumeslice] node.

@parameters

Source Group:
	The volume primitives to be transformed by FFT.

Center DC:
	When performing a forward FFT, shift the DC (zero-frequency) component of the
	spectrum to the center of the volume.  When performing an inverse FFT, assume
	the DC component is located at the center of the volume.

Invert:
	Calculate an inverse FFT.

Normalize:
	Apply a normalization factor so that a forward FFT followed by an inverse FFT yields the original input.

Compute 2D Slices:
	Treat a 3D volume as a series of 2D transforms along the specified axis.
