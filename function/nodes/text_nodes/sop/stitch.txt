= Stitch =

"""Stretches two curves or surfaces to cover a smooth area."""

This node can also be used to create certain types of upholstered
fabrics such as cushions and parachutes.

If a second input is given, it must contain one surface that the
primitives in the first input can stitch to. The left input can contain
either faces or surfaces; in either case, each primitive in the first
input is stitched to a parametric area of the surface in the second
input in such a way that the parametric area allocated to each primitive
is the same and the size of all areas added together equals the
parametric range specified in the _R_ Width (see below).

Please refer to the [Align OP|Node:sop/align] for a discussion of "left"
and "right" primitives as well as the option of an auxiliary input.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to stitch.
    Stitch:
        Allows stitching of subgroups of N primitives or patterns of
        primitives.
    N:
        #channels: /inc

        Pattern to stitch.
    
    Wrap Last to First:
        If this option is turned on, the last stitched primitive is stitched to the first stitched primitive, creating a closed loop.
    
    Direction:
        Direction in which stitching occurs.
    Tolerance:
        #channels: /tolerance

        Minimizes modification to the input sources.
    Bias:
        #channels: /bias

        Which primitive remains unaffected `[0,1]`.
    Left/Right UV:
        #channels: /leftuv1 /leftuv2 /rightuv1 /rightuv2

        Point on left/right primitive to begin/end the stitch.
    LR Width:
        #channels: /lrwidth1 /lrwidth2

        Width of the right and left segments of the stitch.
    Stitch:
        Moves a single row from each primitive to coincide.
    Tangent:
        Modifies neighboring rows on each primitive to create identical
        slopes
    Sharp partials:
        Creates sharp corners at the ends of the stitch when the stitch
        partially spans a primitive.
    Fixed Intersection:
        Allows specification of which side of each slope is modified.
    LR Scale:
        #channels: /lrscale1 /lrscale2

        Direction and position of the tangential slopes.
