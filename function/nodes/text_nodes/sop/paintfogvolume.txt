= Paint Fog Volume =

"""Creates a fog volume based on drawn curve"""

Paint Fog Volume allows freehand drawing of volumes in the viewport. Different projection options allow the drawn volume to be snapped to either an orthographic plane or a collision geometry.

This is a [digital asset|/assets/] build from the [Draw Curve node|Node:sop/drawcurve] and the
[Volume Rasterize Curve node|Node:sop/volumerasterizecurve].

@parameters

== Volume ==

Voxel Size:
    Size of the voxels of the created volume.

== Brush ==

Sample Rate:
    Distance used to sample the curves.
    
Radius:
    Radius multiplier of the brush.

== Projection ==

Live Reprojection:
    None:
        Projection is only done at drawing stage.
            
    Send Rays:
        Reproject by resending rays on underlying changing collision geometry.
            
    Use UVs:
        Use the uv coordinates from the initial projection on changing collision geometry.
            
Trim Curves:
    Delete parts of drawn curves that don't hit any collision geometry.
            
Projection:
    XY/YZ/ZX/Screen Plane:
        Projection of the curve is done on specified orthographic plane.
        
    Geometry:
        Projection is done on the collision geometry that is plugged into first input.     
                  
Projection Center:
    Center of the orthographic projection plane.

== Stroke ==

Individual stroke information is kept as dynamic multiparms.
