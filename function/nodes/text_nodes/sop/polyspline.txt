= PolySpline =

"""The PolySpline SOP fits a spline curve to a polygon or hull and
outputs a polygonal approximation of that spline."""

The PolySpline SOP fits a spline curve to a polygon or hull and outputs a
polygonal approximation of that spline. You can choose either to create
divisions between the original points, or to ignore the position of the
original points and divide the shape into segments of equal lengths.

PolySpline can optionally resample the output curve, providing control
over the length and number of its segments.


TIP:
    When using this op, it is useful to enable Points display in the
    Viewport options dialog. This way you can see exactly what effect
    the op is having.


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of faces to use
    Spline Type:
        Spline type: Bezier, Special Bezier, Special Smooth Bezier,
        Degree 2 Bezier, BSpline, Cardinal, or Linear
    Close:

        Off:
            Output spline open
        On:
            Output spline closed
        If polygon does:
            Use the closure of the input face
    Division Method:

        Standard:
            Do not resample curve
        Even Length Segments:
            Resample - ensure equal segment lengths
        Even X Segments:
            Resample - ensure segments have equal length in x
        Even Y Segments:
            Resample - ensure segments have equal length in y
        Even Z Segments:
            Resample - ensure segments have equal length in z
    Segment Length:
        #channels: /segsize

        The length of the segments in the resampled curve. If set to
        zero, segment length is calculated using the Output Divisions
        parameter.
    Output Divisions:
        #channels: /polydivs

        Number of segments in the resampled curve. If set to zero, the
        number of output divisions is calculated using the Segment
        Length parameter.
    Sample Divisions:
        #channels: /egdedivs

        Number of spline divisions before resampling
    First CV Count:
        #channels: /first

        Number of times to repeat the first control vertex, determining
        its multiplicity
    Last CV Count:
        #channels: /last

        Number of times to repeat the last control vertex, determining
        its multiplicity
    CV Tension:
        #channels: /tension

        Spline tension
