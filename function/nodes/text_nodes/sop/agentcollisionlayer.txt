= Agent Collision Layer =

"""Creates a new agent layer that is suitable for collision detection."""

This nodes creates an agent layer that consists of simple static shapes such as capsules and boxes.
The resulting layer is suitable for use as an agent's collision layer.

@parameters

    Group:
        The agents to add the new layer to.
    Layer Name:
        The name of the new layer.
    Set as Current Layer:
        Sets the current layer of each agent to the new layer.
    Set as Collision Layer:
        Sets the collision layer of each agent to the new layer.
    Collision Shapes:
        The number of collision shapes that should be added.
    Transform Name:
        Specifies which transform in the rig the shape should be attached to.
    Translate:
        Specifies the translation of the shape in local space.
    Rotate:
        Specifies the rotation of the shape about the xyz axes in local space.
    Scale:
        Specifies the size of the shape in local space.
    Pivot:
        Specifies the local pivot point for rotations.
    Shape:
        Specifies the type of primitive shape to create.

@inputs
    Agents:
        Agent primitives.

@outputs
    Agents:
        Agent primitives with additional layer and shapes.
