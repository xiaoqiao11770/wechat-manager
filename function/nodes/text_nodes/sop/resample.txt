"""Resamples one or more curves or surfaces into even length segments."""

The Resample op works natively with all curve types including polygon,
NURBS or Bezier curve inputs. However, for NURBS or Bezier curves the
resample SOP will use a polygonal approximation to calculate the length of
the curve using the LOD parameter - though the final sample points will
still lie on the original curve. Other non-curve geometry will first be
converted to polygon curves before resampling.

== Inputs / Geometry Types ==

The Resample op works in conjunction with any primitive type that
can be converted to polygons. This includes Bezier curves, NURBS
curves, circles, and polygons.

== Example ==

To create a constant length flag with the Resample SOP:

# Create a number of horizontal lines using a [Grid
  SOP|Node:sop/grid]: Primitive Type: Polygon; Connectivity:
  Rows; Size: 3, 1

# Append a [Group SOP|Node:sop/group]: Group: group1; Entity:
  Points; Number: Enable; Pattern: 0-99:1,10

# Append a [Spring SOP|Node:sop/spring]: Source Group: group1;
  Forces/Wind: 1, 0, 0; Turbulence: 1, 0, -1

# Clip each line to a constant length by appending a Resample
  op: Maximum Segments: On; Segments: 15

# Appending a [Skin SOP|Node:sop/skin] whose parameters can stay
  at the default, and enable the Points display in the Viewport
  options.

# Click Play to view the result. Adjust the view as necessary.

# Toggle the display op back and forth between the [Spring
  SOP|Node:sop/spring] and the [Skin SOP|Node:sop/skin]. Notice
  how the lines are stretched and deformed from their original
  length by the forces acting on them in the [Spring
  SOP|Node:sop/spring]. After resampling, they are a constant
  length.

@parameters

Group:
    Group of curves of surfaces to resample.

Level of Detail:
    #id: lod

    Level of detail at which to convert non-polygonal inputs.
    
Resample by Polygon Edge:
    #id: edge

    Each edge of the polygon will be resampled independently. This
    option will preserve corners in the input.
    
Method:
    #id: method

    Even Length Segments:
        Measure the natural edge length.
    Even X Segments:
        Measure the edges against the X axis.
    Even Y Segments:
        Measure the edges against the Y axis.
    Even Z Segments:
        Measure the edges against the Z axis.

Measure:
    #id: measure
    
    Along Arc:
        Measure distance along the original curve between resampled
        points.

    Along Chord:
        Measure distance between resampled points.
        
Maximum Segment Length:
    #id: length

    Specify maximum length of resulting edges.

Length:
    The maximum segment length of resulting edges. If you are working in centimeters, the default is 10. If you are working in meters, the default is 0.1.

Maximum Segments:
    #id: segs

    Specify the maximum number of edges.

Segments:
    The maximum number of edges.

Even Last Segment Same Length:
    #id: allequal

    When enabled, and __Method__ is __Even Length Segments__, and
    __Maximum Segment Length__ is enabled, instead
    of having a last segment that is shorter than the rest, all
    segments are shrunk slightly, so that they all have the same length.

Maintain Last Vertex:
    #id: last

    Include final CV of original in resampled polygon.

Randomize First Segment Length:
    #id: randomshift

    When resampling multiple curves, randomly adjust the first segment
    length for each curve. The randomly chosen length is based on the
    curve primitive number. This option can help to eliminate aliasing
    when using the resample SOP to convert curves to a point cloud.

Create Only Points:
    #id: onlypoints

    Instead of creating new polygon primitives, create only the points
    on the resampled curve. This option can be faster when only the
    resulting points are required.

Treat Polygons As:
    #id: treatpolysas

    Set this to __Subdivision Curves__ to resample polygons as if they are
    smooth, subdivision curves, instead of the usual __Straight Edges__.  The
    __Interpolating Curves__ option will resample them as if they are
    smooth curves that pass through all of the points in the polygon.

Output as Polygon Curves to be Subdivided Later:
    #id: outputsubdpoly

    This option moves the output points in such a way that if the curves
    being output will be subdivided later, e.g. in Mantra or the viewport,
    their subdivided forms should pass through the sampled points.
    This is particularly useful when downsampling
    curves to a small number of points before rendering as subdivision curves.
    Without this option, the shape of the subdivided curves won't match
    the original curves as well.

Distance Attribute:
    #id: ptdistattr

    Create a point attribute storing the length of output curve that
    is closest to each point along the curve.  This is half the sum
    of the lengths of all edges connected to each output point.
    When creating only points, this value
    can be used to determine how much of the original curve each point
    represents.

Tangent Attribute:
    #id: tangentattr

    Create a point attribute storing the normalized curve tangent for
    each point on the resampled curve. When creating only points, this
    value can be used to determine the tangent of the original curve at
    that point.

Curve U Attribute:
    #id: curveuattr

    Create a point attribute storing the unit curve parameter value for
    the resampled point.

Curve Number Attribute:
    #id: curvenumattr

    Create a point attribute storing the curve primitive number for the
    resampled point.
