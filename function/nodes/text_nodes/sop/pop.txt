= POP Merge =

"""Loads the geometry from a pop network back into 
this Geometry object as points."""

This SOP uses an external POP network to run a particle simulation. It
will import the state of the external POP network using the provided
parameters. By connecting SOPs to the inputs of this SOP, one can
override the Context Geometry which is used by the POP network.

TIP:
    To jump to the POP network, press ((RMB)) on a POP Merge node tile
    and choose __Edit POP Network__. This also sets the View Operation
    parameters of the POP viewer to match those of the POP Merge node.

== Context Geometry ==

    All POP networks can have 'Context Geometry'. These context
    geometries are set in the parameters of the POPNET, the Particle
    CHOP, or the Pop Merge SOP. In the Pop Merge SOP they can also be
    set by wiring OPs into the inputs of the operator. These context
    geometries can be referenced by the following POPs: Source POP,
    Collision POP, SoftBody POP, Attractor POP, Creep POP (All of which
    have the parameter - Geometry Source > _Use Context Geometry_). So,
    instead of hard-coding a specific piece of source geometry or
    collision geometry, a single POP network can be used by several Pop
    Merge SOPs to generate several different outputs, depending on the
    geometry input into the Pop Merge SOP.


@parameters
    POP Path:
        A path to the POP to cook. If it points to a POP network, it
        will use the cook POP of that network.
