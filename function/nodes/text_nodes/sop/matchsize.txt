"""Resizes and recenters the geometry according to reference
geometry."""

The Match Size operation moves and scales the first input to match the
second input.  If no second input is present, the provided center and
size are used to define the destination bounding box.

@parameters

Size:
    Size of the destination bounding box along xyz axes.

Center:
    Position of the center of the destination bounding box.

Do Transform:
    Whether to move the geometry to match the center of the
    destination.

Do Scale:
    Whether to scale the geometry to match the size of the
    destination.

@inputs

Source Geometry:
    The geometry which will be resized to fit the destination.
    
Destination Size:
    The geometry whose bounding box will be used to determine how
    to center and size the source.
