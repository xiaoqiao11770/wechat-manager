"""Defines groupings of metaballs so that separate groupings are treated
as separate surfaces when merged."""

If primitive groups are defined by the input, this SOP defines
"groupings" of metaballs - lists of one or more groups containing
metaballs. All of the metaballs in a grouping are merged in the standard
way, while separate groupings are not merged in to the same surface.
This allows users to specify how metaballs are to be merged. In
particular, metaballs in the same grouping are merged by taking the sum
of their weights, while separate metaball groupings are merged by taking
the maximum of the weights of metaballs in the separate groupings.

See the [Meta Expressions|Node:sop/metaball] section of the [Icon:SOP/metaball] [Metaball|Node:sop/metaball] help for more information.

@parameters

Number of Metaball Groupings:
    Specifies the number of metaball groupings to be defined by this
    SOP. The number of groups can be adjusted using either the
    numeric field or the 'More', 'Less' and 'Clear' buttons.

Metaball Grouping:
    A unique field with this name is generated for each metaball
    grouping added by the Number of Metaball Groupings parameter.
    This field specifies the primitive groups to be included in a
    particular grouping. Multiple group names in this field should
    be separated by spaces.
