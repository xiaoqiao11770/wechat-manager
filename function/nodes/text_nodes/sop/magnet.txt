"""Deforms geometry by using another piece of geometry
to attract or repel points."""

The "magnetic field" of influence of the "magnet" geometry is defined by a
metaball field. It allows the creation of animated bumps and dents
within objects, and other special effects.

The actual deformation comes from the
Translates of the Magnet op, and not from the metaball. The metaball
defines the area of effect for the Translates of the Magnet op. The
weight of the metaball determines the effectiveness of the Translates
within the magnet op.

@parameters

Deform Group:
    Geometry to deform.

Magnet Group:
    Magnets to use for the deformation.

    Order in which transformations occur.

Rotate Order:
    Order in which rotations occur.

Translate:
    #id: tx /ty /tz

    Translation caused by the magnet.

Rotate:
    #id: rx /ry /rz

    Rotation caused by the magnet.

Scale:
    #id: sx /sy /sz

== Attributes ==

Affect Position:
    Geometry is deformed.

Affect Point Color:
    Point colors are altered by the magnet.

Clamp Color:
    The point color RGB values are clamped to `[0, 1]` interval.

Affect Point Normal:
    Reorients point normals of the source.
