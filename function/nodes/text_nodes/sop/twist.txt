@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to deform.
    Operation:
        Type of deformation.
        
        Bend:
            Bends the geometry.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_bend]

            NOTE:
                __Rolloff__ acts as a bias for this operation.
        Linear taper:
            Linearly scales the geometry along its length.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_linear_taper.png]
            
        Shear:
            Moves the points on one side of the geometry up and the other
            side down.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_shear.png]
            
        Squash and Stretch:
            Scales up or down in one direction, while doing the opposite
            in the other two directions, to deform the geometry while
            retaining the same volume.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_squashstretch.png]
            
        Taper:
            Scales the geometry along its length.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_taper.png]
            
        Twist:
            Twists the geometry around the axis.
            
            [Largeicon:SHELF/twist_twist.png]
        
    Primary Axis:
        Deformations occur about the primary axis.
    Secondary Axis:
        Points along the secondary axis remain unchanged.
    Pivot:
        #channels: /px /py /pz

        Local origin of deformation.
    Strength:
        #channels: /strength

        Strength of the deformation.
    Rolloff:
        #channels: /roll

        Attenuation of deformation.

        NOTE:
            This parameter normally represents an exponent, but when
            __Operation__ is __Bend__, points along the __Secondary Axis__
            scale the bend from __Rolloff__ - 0.5 to __Rolloff__ + 0.5, so
            you will usually want to keep __Rolloff__ between -0.5 and 0.5.
        
@inputs
    Twist Source:
        Can be any geometry, including NURBS and Beziers, but should
        have sufficient points for a better deformation. Use the [Divide
        SOP|Node:sop/divide] or [Refine SOP|Node:sop/refine] to achieve
        this.
        
@locals
    CEX, CEY, CEZ:
        The centroid of the input
    XMIN, XMAX:
        The X extents of the bounding box of the input
    YMIN, YMAX:
        The Y extents of the bounding box of the input
    ZMIN, ZMAX:
        The Z extents of the bounding box of the input
    SIZEX, SIZEY, SIZEZ:
        The size of the bounding box of the input
