= Point =

"""Manually adds or edits point attributes."""

In Houdini, each geometry primitive has a list of points (numbered from 0). Each point has _attributes_ such as XYZ location, color, alpha, texture UV, weight, and normal direction.

(Polygons, NURBS, and primitives also have a list of _vertices_, which reference points by their position in the point list. These points are shared between multiple polygons/NURBS/primitives.)

The Point SOP lets you edit the attributes of points, including their position. For example, you can change the distance of a point from the center of the object's bounding box (using the local variables `$BBX`, `$BBY`, and `$BBZ`), change the color of a point (`$CR, $CG, $CB`), or change the normal of a point (`$NX, $NY, $NZ`).

This is an extremely general and powerful operator. You can use it for an almost infinite variety of purposes, including deforming a surface (by changing point positions), creating interesting color effects (by changing point colors), and altering the initial trajectories of emitted particles (by changing the point normals).

It is important to note that the expressions in this operator are
evaluated _for each point_. The `$PT` local variable contains the point number of the point currently being processed.

== Tips ==

- When writing  [expressions|/expressions]  for
  editing points, you may find the [point|Exp:point] and
  [pointavg|Exp:pointavg] functions useful.

- To see the point numbers of points in the viewer, turn on the Point numbers icon in the  [display options
  window|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]  (__Viewport Menu > Display > Display
  Options__, or press ((D))) or in the display toolbar on the right side of the viewer.
    
- To flip normals, turn on __Add normals__ and enter `-$NX -$NY -$NZ`.

- While this operator edits the attributes of points, the [Primitive SOP|Node:sop/primitive] edits attributes of entire primitives.

- The local variables in the Point SOP are relative to the point. You can use the prefixes "det", "prim", or "vtx" to use detail, primitive, or vertex variables. For example, `$primTX, $primTY, $primTZ` is the barycenter of the first primitive the point belongs to.



@parameters

    Match By Attribute:
	When there are two inputs the standard behavior is to match
	according to point number.  However, if the inputs are
	particle systems, this might not match properly as one wants
	to match the same particle even if particles are deleted or
	created.  Match By Attribute will have $TX2 refer to the point
	on the second input whose attribute matches the attribute of
	the currently evaluated point.

	If more than one point on the second input matches, the point
	with the greatest point number will be used.
    Attribute To Match:
	Which attribute to use for matching.  This attribute must be
	present on both inputs of the Point SOP.  Equality will be
	determined by treating it as an integer.

    NOTE:
        `Keep` uses the default values, `New` and `Add` allow you to assign new values, and `No` removes all values.
