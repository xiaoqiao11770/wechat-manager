= Unpack =

"""Unpacks packed primitives."""

This SOP takes packed primitives in the input and unpacks them so they can be modified by Houdini.

Packed primitives have an opaque representation and cannot be modified by SOPs , with the exception of simple transforms.  Some packed primitives (Alembic) can represent deforming geometry. However, to allow SOPs to apply deformations, the packed primitives need to be unpacked.

This SOP will not pass through non-packed primitives, unless they are excluded from the group parameter.

@parameters
Group:
    Subset of input geometry to unpack.

Limit Iterations:
	A packed primitive may unpack to further packed primitives.  This
	parameter enables a maximum number of iterations for unpacking.

Iterations:
	The number of iterations specifies how many levels of packed primitives
	you want to unpack.

Transfer Attributes:
	Specifies a list of attributes to transfer to the unpacked geometry.
	Computed point velocities will be transferred if both "v" and "w" point
	attributes exist and are specified.

Apply Style Sheets:
	Causes material style sheet evaluation during the unpack, with the
	resulting style information being attached to the unpacked primitives
	as the `material_stylesheet` attribute. The output from a render
	should not be affected by the unpacking of style sheet information,
	and unpacked style sheet information is much less efficient for
	rendering than specifying styles at the scene or object levels.
	However unpacked styles are much easier to read and understand, and
	are a useful tool for testing and validating that complex style sheets
	will generate the results you expect. See
	[Style Sheets|/shade/stylesheets] for more information on creating
	and using material style sheets.

Scene Style Sheet:
	Equivalent to the style sheet passed to mantra with the `-S` argument.
	Targets in this style sheet must target the object that contains this
	SOP, and specify primitives as sub-targets. To reference a style sheet
	file on disk, you can set this parameter to contain an `importFiles`
	specification in the style sheet such as
	`{ "importFiles" : [ "mss/main_style.json" ] }`.

Object Style Sheet:
	Equivalent to the Style Sheet parameter on the Object. Targets in this
	style sheet will refer directly to the primitives input to the SOP.
