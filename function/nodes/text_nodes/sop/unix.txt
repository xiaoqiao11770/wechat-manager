"""Processes geometry using an external program."""

This operator lets you write an external program/script that reads in
.geo or .bgeo formatted data|/io/geo]
(Houdini automatically detects the format), manipulates the data,
and writes out modified `.geo` or `.bgeo`
(set using the __Output format__ parameter).

NOTE:
    Despite its name, the `unix` command works on non-UNIX operating
    systems.

Houdini includes a number of  [standalone utilities|/ref/utils]
in $HFS/bin (starting with `g`) that process geometry data and
support all geometry types.

Often the standalone utilities included with Houdini follow a
convention where filenames prefixed with `stdin` or `stdout` will
read from standard input or write to standard output, instead of
reading from/writing to a file. For example, you can use gconvert
with this node by calling it as `gconvert stdin.geo stdout.geo`.

TIP:
    You can use an external process to generate geometry rather than
    filtering it by ignoring the input and simply having the external
    program write out the geometry you want to generate.

@parameters
    Command:
        The command string to execute.
        
    Output format:
        Controls the format Houdini sends to the external process,
        `.geo` or `.bgeo`. This is _not_ the output format written by
        the external program (Houdini automatically detects that).

        ASCII:
            Write out .geo data to the external process.
        Binary:
            Write out .bgeo data to the external process.
            
    Force Recook:
        Click to force the node to recook and execute the command.
