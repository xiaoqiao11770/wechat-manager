"""Recreates the shape of the input surface using "high-quality" (nearly equilateral) triangles."""

== Overview ==

This node tries to maximize the smallest angle in each triangle.
(A "high quality" triangle mesh is one where all angles are as close as possible to 60 degrees.)

This node does two types of remeshing:

Fixed length:
    The node tries to equalize all edge lengths, giving triangles of equal size.

Adaptive:
    The node uses bigger triangles in broad areas and smaller triangles in detailed areas.
    This uses allows you to represent the original surface with fewer triangles.
    However, since edge lengths vary, this mode will have fewer equilateral triangles than fixed length.

You can "harden" certain edges to make the remesher preserve them.
This is useful for keeping sharp corners and preserving seams.

== Attributes ==

You can add [point attributes|/model/attributes] to the input surface to give "hints" to the remesher.

Name ||
    Datatype ||
        Description ||
`targetmeshsize` |
    Float |
        An initial target edge length for the edges incident to each point.
        If the value is <= 0, the attribute is ignored.
        The remesher adjusts this value to prevent violation of your selected gradation.
`minmeshsize` |
    Float |
        A minimum target edge length.
        If `targetmeshsize` is less than this value, the remesher uses this value.
`maxmeshsize` |
    Float |
        A maximum target edge length.
        If `targetmeshsize` is greater than this value, the remesher uses this value.

@parameters

Hard Edges Group:
    An [edge group|/model/groups] containing the "hard" edges.
    The remesher may subdivide hard edges, but will preserve them in the output.
    The remesher always preserves boundary (unshared) edges
    and non-manifold edges (edges shared by three or more polygons).
    Use the [Group Geometry SOP|Node:sop/group] to create edge groups.
    
    For example, the remesher changes the shape of a cube by trying to create good triangles.
    Adding the corner edges to a "hard edges" group preserves the shape of the cube.

Iterations:
    Increasing this increases the quality of the generated mesh but takes more time.
    The first few iterations take longer to perform than later iterations,
    but later iterations have decreasing benefit.
    Typically the maximum useful number of iterations is 3 to 4.
    
    If you set the iterations to `0`,
    the node will generate the `targetmeshsize` attribute when __Export size function__ is on,
    and may subdivide edges and polygons,
    but will not generate new high-quality triangles.

Recompute Normals:
    Compute new normals for the generated mesh.
        
Smoothing:
    The amount of additional smoothing to apply after remeshing.

== Fixed Length ==

Target Edge Length:
    How long (in Houdini units) you want the triangle edges to be.

Use Input Points Only:
    Restricts the remesher to only use the points from the input geometry.
    This can severely limit the remesher's ability to generate good triangles.

== Adaptive ==

Gradation:
    The rate at which edge lengths are allowed to change from one triangle to the next.
    Higher values generate fewer triangles but overall quality is lower.
    
Density:
    Higher values give more, smaller triangles.
    If __Gradation__ is high, this parameter will have less effect.
    
    Values less than `1` can coarsen/decimate the mesh,
    however the [PolyReduce node|Node:sop/polyreduce] is better for that.

Min Edge Length:
    A global minimum edge length.
    Increasing this can substantially improve performance with affecting the output.
    
    If you want to set a minimum size only in certain areas,
    use the `minmeshsize` point attribute to set a minimum length
    for edges that include the point.

Max Edge Length:
    A global maximum edge length.
    
    If you want to set a maximum size only in certain areas,
    use the `maxmeshsize` point attribute to set a maximum length
    for edges that include the point.

Export Size Function:
    Create the `targetmeshsize` point attribute on the generated mesh.
    The attribute contains the "best" edge size the remesher calculated at each point.

Visualize Size Function:
    Sets the point color attribute (`Cd`)
    to visualize the "best" edge size the remesher calculated at each point.
    This can give you a sense of where the remesher is generating small and large triangles
    in case where the edges are hard to distinguish in the viewer.
