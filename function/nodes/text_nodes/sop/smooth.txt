= Smooth =

"""Smooths out (or "relaxes") polygons, meshes and
curves without increasing the number of points."""

This node rearranges the existing points in the geometry
to reduce roughness. To smooth by increasing the number of
points, try using the [Subdivide node|Node:sop/subdivide].

Smooth can also smooth any floating-point attributes,
including color and texture coordinates.

[Include:/shelf/smooth#includeme]

TIP:
    Turning the cutoff frequency up beyond 1 sometimes gives much smoother results than sticking to the default 0-1 range.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of primitives to smooth.
Apply To:
    Apply smoothing operation to point position, texture uv's, color,
    or other attributes specified by name.
Attribute Names:
    #channels: /attribname

    Point or vertex attributes to smooth
Cutoff Frequency:
    #channels: /frequency

    Noise frequency to remove. The larger this value, the more it
    will keep the original shape of the geometry.
Smoothing Iterations:
    #channels: /iterations

    Number of smoothing steps.
