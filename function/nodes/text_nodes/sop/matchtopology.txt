"""Reorders the primitive and point numbers of the input geometry to match some reference geometry."""

The vertex counts, point counts, and primitive counts must match between the two pieces of geometry.

If more than one mapping was possible, a warning is raised and the unclear area is
highlighted. Additional point mappings can be specified in this area to force a solution.

If the mapping fails, the failed connected set of primitives will be highlighted.

TIP:
    Match Topology uses vertex order when it checks whether two
    topologies are consistent. If you have two surfaces which seem
    to have identical topologies but Match Topology gives a warning,
    try adding a [Reverse node|Node:sop/reverse] to one of the inputs.
    
NOTE:
    This SOP doesn't match the first input's geometry to the second input's topology.

@parameters

Tracking Points:
    This is a set of points on the first input.

Reference Points:
    This is the set of points that correspond to the tracking points
    on the second input. The order is important here.

Assume Primitives Match:
    If only point orders have been scrambled, checking this toggle
    performs a faster operation.

@inputs

Scrambled Source:
    The geometry whose point and primitive numbers have become
    rearranged.

Reference:
    The geometry whose point and primitive numbers you wish to match
    to.
