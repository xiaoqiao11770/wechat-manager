"""Generates surfaces by stretching cross-sections between
two guide rails."""

The Rails op generates surfaces by stretching cross-sections between two
rails. This is similar to the [Sweep SOP|Node:sop/sweep], but it gives
more control over the orientation and scaling of the cross-sections. The
first op input is the cross-section which will be replicated, and is
typically placed in the XY plane. The second input op source is the
rails along which the cross-section is replicated.

NOTE:
        Each rail should be a single, [open curve (NURBS, polygon, or bezier)|/shelf/curve], and the cross-section is a cross-section of the object resulting if a [Skin SOP|Node:sop/skin] is applied to the output.

@inputs
   Input 1:
        The Cross-section geometry.

    Input 2:
        The Rails geometry.

@parameters
    X-Section Groups:
        Subset of cross section geometry to use.
    Rail Groups:
        Subset of rails geometry to use.
    Cycle Type:
        How the cross-section should be applied to the rails.
    Sweep Along Pairs of Rails:
        Sweeps along rail 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6 etc. instead of 1 & 2, 2 &
        3, 3 & 4 etc.
    Sweep Along First and Last Rail:
        Sweeps along the first and last rail.
    Stretch to Rails:
        Stretches cross-section geometry to rails geometry.
    Use Vertex:
        Specifies two cross section vertices to be placed on rail1 and
        rail2 respectively.
    Connection Vertices:
        #channels: /vertex1 /vertex2

        The vertices used by Use Vertex.
    Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Scales the cross section in x & y.
    Roll:
        #channels: /roll

        Rolls the cross section in z.
    Fix Flipping:
        Tries to correct flipped normals.
    Use Direction:
        Uses specified direction vector.
    Direction:
        #channels: /dirx /diry /dirz

        Direction to point cross sections.
    Create Output Groups:
        Places created rails in a new primitive group.
    Group Name:
        Name of group to create.
