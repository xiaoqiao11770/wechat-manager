"""Cleans up a series of break operations and creates the resulting pieces."""

This operator is used to finish the process of breaking a piece of geometry. It uses the groups and connected pieces created by the [Break|Node:sop/break] operator to output a set of disconnected pieces.

NOTE:
    If your broken object is made into a dynamic object, you do not need to append an assemble because one will be added automatically.
    
The assemble node cleans up the geometry. The following screen captures show what the geometry looks like before using the assemble tool, and after.

@parameters
    Group:
	#channels: /group

	The group that will be finalized.  Ideally this should encompass 
	all geometry that has been affected by a [Break|Node:sop/break] operator.
    Inside Group:
	#channels: /inside_group

	The group name corresponding to the inside faces created by the 
	preceding break operators.  This name should remain consistent 
	for all breaks affecting the same geometry.
    Output Prefix:
	#channels: /outside_group

	The prefix applied to the name attribute and names of the groups
	created by the operator. 
	
	For example, an object broken into 3 parts and given an Output 
	Prefix of `piece` will have three groups named `piece0`, `piece1` 
	and `piece2`.
    
    Piece Attribute:
	An integer primitive attribute with the piece number will be created
	storing which piece the primitive belongs to.

    Create Groups:
	Create a new group for each piece.

    Create Name Attribute:
	Create a primitive attribute called "name" identifying primitives
	belonging to each piece.

    Connect Inside Edges:
	#channels: /connect

	Whether the inside faces of the broken geometry will be connected 
	to the outside faces.  When enabled, the geometry of each output 
	piece will be fully connected.

	TIP:
	    Disabling this option can help create the illusion that 
	    the geometry is not actually broken, since the outside surface 
	    of the object remains unchanged.
    Cusp Edges:
	#channels: /doCusp

	Whether the edges of the output geometry will be cusped.  Ideally, 
	enabling this option will cusp the edges between the outside 
	and inside faces of the broken object.  
	
	However, here the cusp will be applied to all acute angles in 
	the geometry, not just the intersections between the cutting 
	surfaces and the object.

	TIP:
	    This is another option designed to hide the appearance of 
	    fracture lines in the broken object.  

	    However, __Cusp Edges__ should 
	    only be used for smooth geometry with no acute angles, or for 
	    objects that are going to be cusped anyway.
    Create Packed Geometry:
        If the output geometry contains a primitive attribute called "name", a
        packed fragment will be created for each unique value of the name
        attribute. Additionally, a point attribute called "name" will be
        created to identify the piece that packed fragment contains.

        Otherwise, the output geometry will be packed into an embedded packed
        primitive, and the __Output Prefix__ will be used to create the "name"
        point attribute.
    Pivot Location:
	Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
	packed primitive.
