= Pack Points =

"""Packs points into a tiled grid of packed primitives."""

== Packing Points Spatially into Primitives ==

This SOP takes the input geometry and packages it up into a grid of packed primitives.

This provides a way of sorting point data so the delayed-load option on the [File SOP|Node:sop/file] can allow for only paging in regions of interest.

@parameters

Group:
    The subset of the input points to pack.

Tile Size:
    Space is divided into tiles of this size.  All points inside a tile
    are put into a single new packed primitive.  For efficiency, there
    should be at least a thousand points in each resulting primitive.

Display As:
    How packed primitives should be displayed in the viewport.

Path Attribute:
    The path attribute assigned to the newly created packed primitive.  If this
    field is left blank, no path attribute will be created.

Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.
