= Refine =

"""Increases the number of points/CVs in a curve or surface
without changing its shape."""

You can localize the effect to a subsection of the input geometry.

You can also use this node to decrease the number of points/CVs
within a given tolerance, as a simplistic but fast method of
data reduction.

== The Difference Between Refinement and Unrefinement ==

    Refinement and unrefinement work both on faces (polygons, Bezier
    curves and NURBS curves) and surfaces (primitive meshes, Bezier
    surfaces and NURBS surfaces). To unrefine a face or a surface you
    need to specify a parametric interval (not just a single value as in
    refinement). This allows you to unrefine primitives within arbitrary
    intervals, either locally or globally. For example, to unrefine the
    whole primitive choose 0 and 1 as the two parametric boundaries;
    `[0,0.5]` will unrefine only the first parametric half of the
    primitive.

    The interval boundaries are given by the First/Second U/V fields.
    Since refinement does not need an interval, the Second U/V fields
    are disabled by default.

    The Tolerance control is only available for unrefinement, and not
    for refinement. Refinement does not need tolerances because it
    generates a curve or a surface that is mathematically identical to
    the original. Unrefinement, however, may tend to smooth out (or
    "melt") the original in a given area. In short, unrefinement is
    lossy; refinement isn't.

            refining NURBS geometry. /refineu
        Uniform Domain Lengths:
            Refine splines at equal intervals.
        Uniform Arc Lengths:
            Each refinement is done at the center of the maximum knot
            spans (splines) or edge length (polygons).
    Unrefine:

        NURBS Count U, V:
            Number of knots to remove from NURBS geometry at each
            location. /unrefineu /unrefinev
        NURBS Tolerance U, V:
            Only remove knots that do not change the /tolu resulting
            shape by more than this distance. /tolv
    Subdivide:

        Uniform Domain Lengths:
            Divides splines at equal intervals.
        Uniform Arc Lengths:
            Each divide is done at the center of the maximum knot spans
            (splines) or edge length (polygons).
