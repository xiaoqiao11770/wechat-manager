"""Uses a metaball to attract or repel points or springs."""

This node adds force attributes to a metaball field which
make the field attract or repel particles or
springs created by the [Spring node|Node:sop/spring].

In general, force values greater than 0 cause points to be attracted,
less than 0 cause points to be repelled.

You can use this node in conjunction with a [Particle
SOP|Node:sop/particle] to create natural particle simulations of
whirlwinds, tornadoes, water swirling down a drain, and so on.

== Tips ==
  
* To view the metaball field of influence, turn on the hulls display
  of the input metaball/s object/s. Both the [Particle
  SOP|Node:sop/particle] and [Spring SOP|Node:sop/spring] will display
  these hulls as guide geometry.

* Adjust the weights of the metaball inputs to increase or decrease
  the field effect within the metaball field of influence.
 
* In general, it is a good idea to try and keep the scale of forces
  and force fields to a smaller rather than a larger scale. This tends
  to make particle movement and attraction more manageable and
  realistic.

@parameters

== Radial Force ==

Overview:
    Triggers force to radius of metaball field.

Force:
    #id: radial

    Controls the strength of the radial force.

== Directional Force ==

Overview:
    Allows control of force attributes.

Direction:
    #id: dir

    Primary axis of metaball field.

Axial Force:
    #id: axial

    Force along primary axis of field.

Vortex Force:
    #id: vortex

    Amount of twist around primary axis.

Spiral Force:
    #id: spiral

    Attraction force perpendicular to axis.

@inputs

This node only accepts metaballs. Connecting anything else has no effect.
