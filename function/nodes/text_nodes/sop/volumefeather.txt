= Volume Feather =

"""Feathers the edges of volumes."""

The Volume Feather operation smooths the edges of the scalar data in volume
primitives.  This is done either in an inwards or outwards direction. It sets the maximum rate of change in the volume, clamps either increasing or decreasing transitions, and can be thought of as a one-sided blur.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be feathered.
    Decay:
	The distance multiplier factor to use to adjust the change in the voxel
	value for each unit change in worldspace.  Lower decay values will
	result in a larger feather radius.
    Feather Exterior:
	If this voxel has value `V`, and is distance `D` from another voxel of value `W`, the result is `MAX(V, W-decay*D)` for outside and `MIN(V, W+decay*D)` for inside.  The result is for fog volumes to grow in the outside mode and shrink in the inside mode.
