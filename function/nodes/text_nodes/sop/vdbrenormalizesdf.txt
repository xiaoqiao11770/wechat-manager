"""Fixes signed distance fields stored in VDB volume primitives."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node iteratively adjusts the voxel values to properly respect the distance to the zero crossing line. 
This requires proper signed distance fields for the results to be meaningful.

NOTE:
    If you have significant departures from a proper signed distance field, you can rebuild it with the [VDB From Polygons node|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons].
    That node will implicitly convert an input SDF to polygons, then convert the polygons back to an SDF.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of the VDB volume primitives in the input to be normalized.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Iterations:
    The number of rounds of renormalization that should be performed.  More rounds are slower but will result in a more correct SDF.

Renorm Accuracy:
    #id: accuracy
    
    The method for smoothing the SDF after each iteration.
    Later options in the list are slower but more accurate.
