= PolyPatch =

"""Creates a smooth polygonal patch from primitives."""

The Polypatch op creates a smooth polygonal patch from a mesh primitive
or a set of faces (polygons, NURBS or Bezier curves).

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of input to use
    
Spline Type:
    Cardinal or B-Spline
    
Connectivity:
    How to connect the patch together:

    Rows:
        Creates horizontal lines, which are open polygons
    Columns:
        Creates vertical lines, which are open polygons
    Rows & Cols:
        Both rows and columns, all open polygons
    Triangles:
        Build the grid with triangles
    Alternating Triangles:
        Build the grid with alternating triangles
    Quadrilaterals:
        Four-sided quadrilaterals (default)
    Inherit from Source:
        Same connectivity as the mesh source

U Wrap:
    #id: closeu
    
    The wrapping of the built patch.

    Off:
        Do not wrap in U/V
    On:
        Wrap in U/V
    If prim. does:
        Wrap in U/V if the input primitive does

U Clamp (First):
    #id: firstuclamp
    
    The clamping of the built patch.

    Off:
        Do not clamp the first/last end in the U/V direction
        
    On:
        Clamp the first/last end in the U/V direction
        
    If prim. does:
        Clamp the first/last end in the U/V direction if the input
        primitive does

Output Divisions:
    #channels: /divisionsx /divisionsy

    The number of divisions in the output surface. Use more
    divisions for a smoother surface.

Output Polygons:
    Force polygonal rather than mesh output
