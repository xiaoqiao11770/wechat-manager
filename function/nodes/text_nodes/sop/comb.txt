"""Adjust surface point normals by painting."""

The Comb brush is designed to allow you to intuitively adjust surface
point normals in the viewer. The brush pushes point normals over as it moves
across the surface.

@parameters

== Operation ==

Comb Lift:
    #channels: /lift

    This controls how far the normals will be lifted off the
    surface. A value of 1 will cause the normals to move towards
    an upright position, a value of 0 will cause them to move
    towards lying flat in the dragged direction, and a value of
    -1 will cause them to move towards a downright position.
Keep Normal Length:
    If not set, the normals will be normalized when they are
    combed. If it is set, the length of the normals will be left
    unchanged by the comb operation.
Override Normal:
    This allows you to specify an attribute other than N to
    comb. The attribute must be 3 floats in length.
Reset All Changes:
    This button will restore the geometry to its original
    state.
Operation for All:
    Comb Normals:
         Updates a vector attribute by blending it with a target direction. The target direction is computed by adding the brushed direction (tangent to the surface) and a "lift" amount in the normal direction. The amount of blending is controlled by the __Opacity__.
    Smooth Normals:
        Uses the average of the nearby vector attributes as the target direction.
    Erase Change:
        Uses the original attribute value as the target direction.
    Lift Normals:
         Allows the lift to change, but prevents any rotation about the surface normal.
    Rotate Normals:
        Allows the direction of the vector attribute to change (ie. it can rotate about the surface normal), but prevents the lift from changing.
