= VDB Vector Split =

"""Splits a vector VDB primitive into three scalar VDB primitives."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node will create three new scalar primitives named `<<input>>.x`, `<<input>>.y`, and `<<input>>.z`.

TIP:
    To reverse the split (merge three scalar VDBs into a vector VDB), use [VDB Vector Merge node|Node:sop/vdbvectormerge] and set the groups to `@name=*.x`, `@name=*.y`, and `@name=*.z`.

@parameters

Group:
    The name of a vector VDB primitive to split.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Remove Source VDBs:
    Removes the split vector VDB from the output.

Copy Inactive Values:
    If enabled, split the values of both active and inactive voxels.
    If disabled, split the values of active voxels only.
