"""Deletes input geometry by group, entity number, bounding volume,
primitive/point/edge normals, and/or degeneracy."""

In addition to simply deleting unwanted parts of a model, this operator
is useful for culling primitives from very dense geometry to speed up
cooking of nodes downstream.

This operation can also delete profile groups (for example,
`0.5 1.2-3.9`) and mixed groups (for example, `0 0.5 4-12 1.2-3.9`).
 It can also delete entire paste hierarchies or pasted surfaces, 
causing the remaining hierarchy to update. By deleting the root of a 
paste hierarchy, the whole hierarchy becomes undone.

@parameters

NOTE:
    This node deletes entries in the __Group__ field and any polygons matching the criteria in the __Operation__, __Entity__, and __Geometry Type__ fields.
        
Group:
    Subset of the input geometry to delete, in addition to those parts matching
    the other criteria.

Operation:
    How the rules below affect the geometry.

    Delete selected:
        Delete the geometry that matches the rules below.
    
    Delete non-selected:
        Delete the geometry that _doesn't match_ the rules below.
    
Entity:
    Points:
        Delete points.
    
    Primitives:
        Delete primitives.

    Edges:
	Delete the points associated with each selected edge.

Geometry Type:
    Type of geometry to delete.

== Number ==

Enable:
    Turns on the controls for this tab and allows you to delete by point/primitive/edge numbers.

Operation:
    How to choose which points/primitives/edges to delete.
    
    Delete by pattern:
        Delete points/primitives whose numbers match a pattern
        string. Edges use primitive numbers.
    Delete by range:
        Delete points/primitives whose numbers fall within a
        certain range, and/or delete every few
        points/primitives. Edges use primitive numbers.
    Delete by expression:
        Evaluate an expression for each point/primitive and
        delete it if the expression returns true.
Filter Expression:
    #id: filter

    (When __Operation__ is "Delete by expression") Evaluates
    this expression for every point/primitive and, if the
    expression is true, deletes the point/primitive.

    You can use all the local variables of the
    [Point|Node:sop/point] and [Primitive|Node:sop/primitive]
    operations in this expression.

Pattern:
    (When __Operation__ is "Delete by pattern") Deletes
    points/primitives/edges that match this pattern.

Start/End:
    #id: rangeend

    (When __Operation__ is "Delete by range") The range of
    geometry to be deleted.

Select _ of _:
    #id: select

    (When __Operation__ is "Delete by range") Deletes every
    (number in the left field) points/primitives for every
    (number in the right field) points/primitives in the input.
    Edges are ranged by primitive numbers.


== Bounding Volume ==

Enable:
    Turns on the controls for this tab and allows you to delete entities inside a bounding volume.

Bounding Type:
    Shape of bounding volume.


    Bounding box:
        Delete points/primitives/edges within a bounding box.
    Bounding sphere:
        Delete points/primitives/edges within a bounding sphere.
Size:
    #id: size

    Size of the bounding volume.

Center:
    #id: t

    Center of the bounding volume.

== Normal ==

Enable:
    Turns on the controls for this tab and allows you to delete entities based on their normals.

Direction:
    #id: dir

    Delete points/primitives/edges with normals pointing in this
    direction. Use the __Spread angle__

Spread Angle:
    #id: angle

    Angle of deviation from specified direction for which
    geometry will be deleted.

Backface from:
    Specifies a camera. Polygons that face away from the camera are deleted.

== Degenerate ==
    
    Enable:
        Turns on the controls for this tab and allows you to delete degenerate entities.

    Delete Degenerate Primitives:
        #id: degenerate

        Remove repeated references of points and vertices within faces and
        then delete all degenerate primitives.

    Delete Zero-Area Faces:
        #id: zaf

        Delete faces with no surface area (that is, a face whose
        points are all in a line).

    Treat Open Faces as Closed:
        #id: doopen

        Consider open faces as if they were closed when deciding to
        delete zero-area faces.

    Tolerance:
        #id: tol

        Precision of algorithm used to compute degeneracy and
        colinearity.

Delete Unused Groups:
    Remove any groups that are left empty after deleting
    points/primitives/edges.

Keep points:    
    By default, if you delete a lot of polygons, the points that are no longer in use are also deleted. Turning on __Keep Points__ will keep these points floating in space.

@locals

N:
    The number minus one of points or primitives, depending on the
    "Entity" choice.
