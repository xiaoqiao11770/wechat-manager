@parameters

Consolidate Points:
    Fuses together points with similar positions.
    
Remove Degenerate Primitives:
    Deletes degenerate primitives such as polygons with zero area.
    
Orient Polygons:
    Changes the orientation of polygons so they all face the same
    direction.
    
Reverse Winding:
    Reverses the orientation, or winding, of all the primitives.  This
    is useful when importing or exporting to packages which use the
    opposite winding order of Houdini.
    
Fix Overlaps:
    Deletes polygons which overlap, (share all the same vertices).
    
Delete Overlap Pairs:
    When this option is on, overlapping polygons are both deleted.
    This is useful when the overlap comes from two objects fusing
    along an edge. When this option is off, the first overlapping
    polygon is kept and the second polygon is deleted.
    
Remove Unused Points:
    Delete points which are not part of a primitive.
    
Remove Attributes:
    Remove point, primitive, detail, or vertex attributes that
    match a pattern.
    
Remove Groups:
    Remove point or primitive groups that match a pattern.
    
Remove NANs:
    Delete points with positions containing a `NaN` (Not a Number)
    floating point value.

    `NAN` is a special floating point bit pattern which indicates a
    failure, such as zero divided by zero or the square root of minus
    one. Houdini strives not to introduce these numbers, but this
    option is available for any cases where `NaN` values appear.

    Expert users can examine the VOP network inside this node to see
    how to detect `NaN` values in their own networks if necessary.

Manifold-Only Topology:
	Ensures that all polygon topolgy is made up of manifold patches. Non-manifold points are minimally duplicated and their incident polygons are reassigned to various copies to make sure this is the case. 
	
Delete Small Manifold Patches:
	If the __Manifold-Only Topology__ checkbox is turned on, this option deletes any maximal manifold patch that contains fewer polygons than the threshold specified in the __Primitive Threshold__ parameter. Such small manifold patches can particularly be generated (detached from the input geometry) during repair of non-manifold topology. 
	
Primitive Threshold:
	Specifies the maximum number of primitives in a manifold patch that is to be deleted.
