= Particle Fluid Tank =

"""Creates a set of regular points filling a tank."""

This operator is used to generate a regular set of points that fill 
a given tank. This can be useful for initializing 
a [flip fluid|Node:dop/flipobject].

Increasing the __Particle Separation__ will lower the resolution, which will make your simulation faster to process. __Particle Separation__ is measured in meters, so a particle separation value of 0.1 is 10 cm. The lowest possible value is 0.2, or 2 cm.

The __Particle Radius Scale__ is a visual tool that will affect surfacing. The smaller this value is, the higher detail the surface will be. If this value is high, it will result in a smoother surface.

@parameters
    Particle Separation:
	#channels: /particlesep
    
	The smallest distance between any two of the generated particles 
	in the initial configuration. 

    Point Configuration:
	#channels: /inittype

	The configuration of the points to be generated, before any 
	jitter is applied.

	Grid:
	    A loosely packed configuration that places the points at 
	    the vertices of a regular three-dimensional grid.
	Tetrahedral:
	    A tightly packed configuration placing points at equal 
	    distance from each of the three other closest points.
    
    Water Level:
	How deep to fill the liquid.  Measured as actual distance
	above the water level reference to the top of the water.
	To empty the tank, lower this past the bottom of the tank.
    Size:
        #channels: /sizex /sizey /sizez

        Size of the tank along xyz axes.
    Center:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Position of center of tank.
    Water Level Reference:
	The water level parameter fills the tank to an offset of
	this location.  By having a separate parameter, you can
	either make the water level an absolute value or have
	it relative to the tank by using a `ch("./tx")` style
	expression.
    Jitter Seed:
	#channels: /jitterseed
	
	Random seed for creating jitter.
    Jitter Scale:
	#channels: /jitterscale
	
	The amount of jitter to apply to the positional values of the points.  
	Jitter causes random changes to the positions of the points.

	TIP:
	    Set this value to 0 if no jitter whatsoever is desired.
    Up Axis:
	The direction to fill the box in.  Controls which way
	the water level cut off is applied.

    Add Scale Attribute:
	Creates the `pscale` attribute and sets it to 2x the particle
	separation.  This allows the [ Fluid Surface SOP|Node:sop/particlefluidsurface] to
	get the right scale for rebuilding the original surface.

    Particle Radius Scale:
	The scale attribute is this multiple of the particle
	separation.  Having the particles larger than the separation
	ensures no particles are lost in the gaps between voxels.

    Padding Bandwidth:
        Pad the boundaries of the tank to the specified distance, which can help reduce boundary jittering in a FLIP simulation.  This parameter is specified in multiples of the __Particle Separation__.

    Scatter Density:
        Scatter points on the surface of the tank, which can help create flat surface for 
        a FLIP simulation.  For a value of 1 the scattered points will be approximately separated
        by __Particle Separation__. Increasing this value will oversample the surface.

    Relax Iterations:
        When enabled, scattered points will be relaxed, pushed away from each other, to avoid clumping.
        This is done gradually, to avoid chaotic behavior and to allow control over how much relaxation
        takes place.  More relaxation iterations results in points that are more separated from each other.
        A distribution of points in which they are well separated is often called "blue noise".

    Oversampling:
        The amount to oversample the points within a distance from the surface of the tank,
        as specified by the __Oversampling Bandwidth__.

    Oversampling Bandwidth:
        The points will be oversampled to this distance from the the surface of the tank.  This parameter
        is specified in multiples of the __Particle Separation__.

    Viscosity:
	Creates a `viscosity` attribute and sets it to the given value.  If the
	fluid solver has both __Viscosity__ and __Use Particle Viscosity__
	enabled, this will be multiplied with the fluid's base viscosity.  

    Density:
	Creates a `density` attribute and sets it to the given value.  If the
	fluid solver has __Density From Attribute__ set, this will be scaled
	against the fluid's base density to determine the effective
	per-particle mass.  This attribute is scale independent, so it shouldn't
	vary with the particle separation.

    Create Output Group:
	Create a group containing the generated points. 

    Output Group:
	The name of the generated output point group.
