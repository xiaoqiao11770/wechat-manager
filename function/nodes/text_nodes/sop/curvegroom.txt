"""Allows intuitive manipulation of guide curves in the viewport."""

@parameters

Cache Strokes:
    Bakes all recorded strokes into a cache and deletes the strokes.

Reset Strokes:
    Deletes all recorded strokes and the cache, so the output will be identical to the input geometry.

== Initial Setup ==

Primitive Group:
    The group of curves to affect.
    
Collision Radius:
    Controls how far hairs are pushed away from the skin geometry during collision resolution.
    
Curve Segments:
    The number of segments in each guide. When this node is created using the Grooming shelf tools, this is linked to the Fur object's Segments parameter, since that is what will be used during rendering.

== Brush ==

Tool:
    Lets you choose one of various grooming tools.

    All tools have a corresponding shelf tool. These are documented in detail at the links below.

    [Icon:FUR/screen_brush][Screen Brush|/shelf/screenbrush]:
            Groom hair in screen space.
            
    [Icon:FUR/surface_brush][Surface Brush|/shelf/surfacebrush]:
            Groom hair along the surface of your geometry.
            
    [Icon:FUR/cut_hair][Cut Hair|/shelf/cuthair]:
            Interactively trim hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/length][Extend Hair|/shelf/extendhair]:
            Interactively lengthen hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/lift_hair][Lift Hair|/shelf/lifthair]:
            Interactively push hair away from the surface.
            
    [Icon:FUR/clump_hair][Clump Hair|/shelf/clumphair]:
            Interactively pull hair into a clump.
            
    [Icon:FUR/part_hair][Part Hair|/shelf/parthair]:
            Interactively push hair away from your stroke.
            
    [Icon:FUR/adjust_length][Adjust Length|/shelf/lengthadjust]:
            Interactively vary the length of the ends of the hair.
            
    [Icon:FUR/smooth][Smooth Hair|/shelf/smoothhair]:
            Interactively smooth areas of hair.

    [Icon:FUR/plantguides][Plant Guides|/shelf/plantguides]:
            Interactively plant individual guides.

Radius:
    The radius of the brush.

Strength:
    Controls the strength of the effect of various brushes.

Lift:
    Enforces a minimum lift angle while brushing. Only hair that is currently lifted higher than the specified value is affected. The __Collision Radius__ needs to enclose all hair for this to work correctly.

Smoothing Radius:
    The radius within which the smooth tool looks for neighboring guides.

Randomize:
    Values greater than zero will randomize the effect various brushes have.

Constrain Length:
    Turning this off allows you to freely sculpt hair points without any length constraints.

Lock Roots In Place:
    Turning this off will allow you to move the hair and roots around on the skin surface.

With the Adjust Length tool:

Target Length:
    Adjust the length of hairs on the brush to this value.

Random Length:
    For each guide, use a random length between the length between the Min/Max value.

Target Length Range:
    The range of lengths from which to randomly pick a length when __Random Length__ is active.

With the Plant Guides tool:

Interpolate Neighbors:
    Interpolate the length and shape of neighboring guides when planting new ones.

Default Length:
    When __Interpolate Neighbors__ is off, use this length for newly planted guides.

=== Falloff ===

Ramp:
    Controls the falloff of the brush from the center. The buttons above can be used to apply various presets.

=== Mirroring ===

NOTE:
    Mirroring only works when the guides on both sides are part of the Curve Groom node's selection.

Mirroring:
    When enabled, mirrors grooming strokes as they are made.
Origin:
    The origin of the mirror plane.
Direction:
    The direction to across.

== Display ==

NOTE:
    When using the grooming shelf tools, the texture parameters are automatically hooked up to the fur shader.

Use Textures:
    Sample display colors from textures. These are looked up in the skin's UV space. When using the grooming shelf tools.
Root Brightness:
    Can be used to artificially darken the displayed root color, which makes it easier to see the shape and direction of densely packed guides.
Root Color Texture:
    Texture for the guide's root color.
Tip Color Texture:
    Texture for the guide's tip color.
Root Color:
    Uniform color of the guide roots.
Tip Color:
    Uniform color of the guide roots.
