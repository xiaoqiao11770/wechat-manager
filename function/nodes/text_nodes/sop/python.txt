"""Runs a Python snippet to modify the incoming geometry."""

This node is designed to modify the input geometry.
If you just want to run a script whenever the network cooks, see the [Script SOP|Node:sop/script].

This node lets you modify geometry in a network using a quick ad-hoc script.
To create a new, reusable geometry node type using python, see
[creating a geometry SOP with Python|/hom/pythonsop#node_type].

See [editing geometry using python|/hom/pythonsop] for information on how to write the script.
