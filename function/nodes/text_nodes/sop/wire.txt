= Wireframe =

"""Constructs polygonal tubes around polylines, creating
renderable geometry."""

The Wireframe operation converts edges to tubes and points to spheres,
creating the look of a wire frame structure in rendering.

Wireframe works only with polygons and/or particles as input.

TIP:
    Use the [Poly Wire node|Node:sop/polywire] to create more
    complex tube geometry from curves, with smoother bends and
    intersections than Wireframe, especially for
    [L-systems|Node:sop/lsystem].

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to convert.
    Wire Radius:
        #channels: /radius

        Radius of individual wires used in construction.
    Round Corners:
        Places spheres at locations of points.
    End-Caps:
        Places endcaps on tube geometry.
    Remove Polygons:
        Removes the original geometry.
