= Point Jitter =

"""Jitters points in random directions."""

This node will randomize point locations by slightly altering their
values.  This is useful when precisely aligned data can be a problem.
For example, a set of springs that are exactly aligned might be in
unrealistically precise balance.  Jittering the point positions
will break the artificial symmetry.

This node works on points.

@parameters
    Group:
        Points to jitter.
    Id Attribute:
	Instead of using the point number as the seed, use this integer
	attribute.
    Scale:
        Overall scale of the offset to move the points.  Points are
        jittered by a value of -0.5 to 0.5 times this scale, and then
        modified by the other scales.
    Axis Scales:
        Each axis of jitter is scaled by the corresponding scale here.
        This can be used to achieve a two dimensional jitter by
        setting the unwanted axis to 0.
    Seed:
        The random number seed used to generate the jitter values.
        Changing this will create a different set of jitter offsets.
    Use PScale:
        If enabled, the `pscale` point attribute will be used to further
        scale the jitter amount.  This provides per-point jitter
        control.
