"""Deforms captured points according to muscle deformations. """

Connect the output of a [Capture Metaball SOP|Node:sop/capturemeta]
that uses muscles as its capture regions to the input of this node.
This node deforms the captured skin geometry as the muscles deform
using the attributes created by the Capture Metaball SOP to determine
which surfaces are controlled by which metaball groups.  Muscles are
created using the [Muscle Object|Node:obj/muscle].

This deformation occurs in two stages. First, the skin geometry is
deformed according to the positions of the metaballs contained in each
muscle (see also [Deform Metaball|Node:sop/deformmeta]). Next, the skin
geometry is inflated over the muscle surface (see also
[Inflate|Node:sop/inflate]) so that the shape of the muscles is
preserved by the skin.

Muscles are generated using blended metaballs. The density of each
metaball where it captured to the skin geometry at the capture frame
controls how much influence the metaball has when it deforms the skin
geometry. This density is multiplied by the weight of the group that
metaball is contained in. Group weights are specified by the [Capture
Metaball|Node:sop/capturemeta] and [Capture Layer
Paint|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint] nodes.  Group weights are also used
by this operator to determine which muscles influence each point
during inflation.

@parameters

== Deform ==

This tab controls point deformation.  In this stage, input
points are deformed according to changes in the captured
muscle structure.

Normalize Group Weights:
    #id: normalize

    Normalize group weights before performing the deformation.

Pre-Compute Normals:
    Calculates point normals before doing anything. You can use
    these normals with __Deform Normals__.

Deform Normals:
    Deforms point normals to match the deformation of the
    points. This can help keep normals pointed correctly after
    deformation.

Deform Vector Attributes:
    Deforms vector attributes to match the deformation of
    the points.

Vector Attributes:
    Vector attributes to deform.

Deform Quaternion Attributes:
    Deforms quaternion attributes to match the deformation
    of the points.

Quaternion Attributes:
    Quaternion (Float\[4]) attributes to deform.

Position Bias Multiplier:
    Increasing this parameter biases the capture weights of
    points more towards metaballs that are close to that point's
    capture position. It can be used in conjunction with the
    Capture Position Bias parameter on the Muscle Object.
    This parameter acts as a multiplier to the muscle specific
    __Capture Position Bias__ parameter in the
    [Muscle Object|Node:obj/muscle].  Increase this parameter
    to reduce the effective radius of influence of metaballs
    on surrounding points during deformation.  Decrease this
    parameter to increase this radius of influence.

Assume Only Coordinate Changes In Input:
    Enables the assumption that only point positions need to be
    re-cached when the input geometry has changed to allow faster
    cooking. Unpredictable results will occur with this enabled if
    attributes or topology changes.

== Inflate ==

This tab controls point inflation.  In this stage, points are
optionally inflated to lie on top of the captured muscle
geometry.

Enable Inflation:
    Enables or disables the inflation step of the deform
    process. If inflation is disabled, then the captured
    geometry is deformed according to the underlying muscle
    positions but is not inflated to lie on top of the muscle
    surface.

Points To Inflate:
   Specifies which points in the input geometry should be
   influenced in the inflation step.

   Inflate All Points:
        All points in the input geometry may be inflated.
   Use Inflate Modifier Attribute:
        The [Slide Modifier Paint operator|Node:sop/slidemodifierpaint]
        may be used to paint a "Surface Inflation Modifier" attribute
        using the __Attribute to Paint__ parameter on this node.
        This attribute is used to determine how to inflate points
        in the input geometry when "Use Inflate Modifier Attribute"
        is specified.  This float attribute may take any value between
        0 and 1.  A value of 0 specifies that a point should remain at
        its deformed position without inflating.  A value of 1 specifies
        that a point should be transformed to its fully inflated position.
        Values in between 0 and 1 blend linearly between the two
        positions.  This option can be used to specify exactly what
        locations of the input geometry require inflation.

Muscles For Inflation:
    Use this parameter to specify a list of muscles over which the
    input geometry is to be inflated.  Points in the input geometry
    will only be inflated over the muscles in this list.

Maximum Inflation:
    The maximum distance that a point can be pushed away from
    its original position. If a muscle cannot be found within
    this distance, the point is kept at its original position.

Inflate Tolerance:
    This controls the tolerance used when trying to locate a
    position on the muscle surface to place each point in the
    deformed geometry. A higher tolerance can provide increased
    performance, while a lower tolerance results in a smoother
    skin surface. In general, a higher tolerance such as 0.01 is
    sufficient for interactive work, while a lower tolerance
    such as 0.0001 is more appropriate for animation.

Joint Group:
    The points in this group will be considered joint points,
    and so special consideration for them will be given when
    inflating and __Exclude Opposing Metaballs for Joint Group__
    is enabled. When a point is in a joint group, it will not be
    inflated to any metaballs whose normals point in an opposite
    direction to the point's normal. This is especially useful
    for points in the inside curve of a joint because it will
    keep points from inflating to a muscle on the opposite side
    of the joint. The [Group Paint SOP|Node:sop/grouppaint] can
    be used to easily paint this group.  Alternately, inflation
    can be avoided entirely in the inside of a character's joints
    by setting __Points to Inflate__ to
    "Use Inflate Modifier Attribute" and painting points such that
    these points are not inflated.

Exclude Opposing Metaballs for Joint Group:
    Checks to make sure that a metaball's normal and the point
    normal for a given point are not pointed in opposite
    directions. If they are, the point should not be inflated to
    that metaball, since it is on the opposing side of the
    joint. This option turns this check on or off for points in
    the joint group.

Enable Sliding:
    If this parameter is enabled then the Deform Muscle SOP
    simulates the effect of skin sliding over top of the underlying
    muscle surface. For this to work, each [Muscle
    Object|Node:obj/muscle] to which the geometry is captured must
    define a rest anchor.

Sliding Coefficient:
    The amount of sliding to allow during deformation. If this
    parameter is set to zero, then points in the captured geometry
    stick perfectly to the muscle surface during deformation and no
    sliding occurs. If this parameter is set to one, then points do
    not stick to the underlying muscle surface at all, and the skin
    slides freely over the muscles. This parameter may be modified
    on a per-point basis using the [Slide Modifier
    Paint|Node:sop/slidemodifierpaint] operation.

== Smoothing ==

This tab controls geometry smoothing.  It can optionally be used to
smooth out portions of the input geometry that have deformed or
inflated in an undesirable way.  See also the
[Smooth SOP|Node:sop/smooth].

Enable Smoothing:
    Enables or disables geometry smoothing.

Primitive Group to Smooth:
    Use this parameter to specify a primitive group in the input
    geometry to perform the smoothing operation on.

Smoothing Cutoff Frequency:
    Noise frequency to remove. The larger this value, the more it
    will keep the original shape of the geometry.

Smoothing Iterations:
    Number of smoothing steps.

Boundary Clamping:
    When this parameter is set to 0, points on the boundary of the
    group specified in __Primitive Group to Smooth__ may also be
    affected by the smooth operation.  Setting this parameter to 1
    clamps this points to remain in their original position.
    Values between 0 and 1 blend the boundary point positions between
    their un-clamped and fully clamped positions.

@inputs

Captured Geometry:
    This must be geometry that has a valid `metaCapture` point
    attribute, such as the output of a [Capture Metaball
    SOP|Node:sop/capturemeta].

@outputs

Output:
