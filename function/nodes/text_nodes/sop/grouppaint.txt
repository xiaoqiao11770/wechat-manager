"""Sets group membership interactively by painting."""

The Group Paint SOP lets you use a brush over points to add them to
or remove them from a point group.

If the group specified does not exist, then this SOP creates it.

@parameters

== Operation ==

Point Group:
    The point group to be affected by the paint operation.

Operation:
    The operation performed by the brush when painting.

    Add Points:
        Adds the painted points to the group.
    
    Remove Points:
        Removes the painted points from the group.

Accumulate To Stencil:
    See  [about accumulate to stencil|/basics/brush] . By
    default, the operation is applied and the stencil cleared
    after every brush stroke. When this option is on, Houdini
    does not apply the stencil until you click __Apply and Clear
    Stencil__.

Apply & Clear Stencil:
    Applies the operation and clears the stencil. This is
    equivalent to right-clicking in the viewport.

Reset All Changes:
    Restores the selected group to its initial state.

Visualize Attribute:
    Whether to do a false color visualization of what points
    are currently included in the specified point group.

Visualize Mode:
    How to map group inclusion to a color.

== Brush ==

Shape:
    The basic shape of the brush: circle or square.

Radius:
    #id: radius

    The radius of the brush when painting in the 3d viewport

Brush Angle:
    #id: brushangle

    How far to rotate the brush.

Brush Squash:
    #id: squash

    Amount to squash the brush in the y direction before
    rotation.

== Symmetry ==

Reflective:
    If set, the brush will perform reflective symmetry. Any
    strokes will be mirrored along the plane of symmetry.

Rotational:
    If set, the brush will perform rotational symmetry. Any
    strokes will be rotated around the axis of symmetry.

Axis:
    #id: symaxisx /symaxisy /symaxisz

    This defines the normal of the plane of symmetry for
    reflection and the axis of symmetry for rotation.

Origin:
    #id: symorigx /symorigy /symorigz

    This defines the origin of the plane of symmetry for
    reflection and the origin of the axis of symmetry for
    rotation.

Number of Rotate:
    #id: symrot

    This defines the degree of rotational symmetry. A degree of
    3 means the stroke will be applied 3 times at 120 degree
    separation. A value of 5 will perform the stroke 5 times
    with 72 degrees of separation.

Reflection Dist:
    #id: symdist

    This is the distance of the plane of symmetry from the
    origin of symmetry.

UV Reflection:
    If set, the brush will reflect when brushing is done in the
    UV viewport.

UV Origin:
    #id: symuvorig

    The origin of the line of reflection in the UV viewport.

UV Angle:
    #id: symuvangle

    The angle of the line of reflection in the UV viewport. 0
    will mirror about the U axis, 90 will mirror about the V
    axis.

== Stroke ==

Orient Brush to Surface:
    Switches between the brush being perpendicular to the
    surface or always oriented along the view direction. If you
    are having trouble with a shaky brush, try turning this
    off.

Use Connectivity:
    If set, the tool will only affect points connected to the
    closest point to the intersection. This is usually a good
    thing, as it avoids accidentally painting through the
    geometry (but see the depth parameter), but can prevent
    smoothly painting across seams.

Realtime Mode:
    Set this to paint geometry as it's deforming.

Direction:
    The current direction of the brush. If orient to surface is
    on, this is the normal direction of the surface hit by the
    brush. Otherwise, it is the direction from the eye to the
    surface.

Hit Location:
    The current location of the brush. This tracks the surface
    as the brush moves along it.

Hit Primitive:
    The primitive number of the primitive the current brush is
    centered at.

Hit UV:
    The location the current brush is on the current primitive.
    Note this is a parametric UV location, not the texture UV
    location.

Hit Pressure:
    The amount of force the brush is currently applying. This
    is only meaningful when a tablet interface that supports
    pressure is used.

Hit Point:
    The point closest to the current brush's center.

Event:
    Controls the current state of the brush. When it is on
    No-op, the values of the stroke tab are ignored and no
    updating of the geometry is done. Other values are set
    automatically as you brush the surface, allowing the SOP to
    update in response to your actions.
