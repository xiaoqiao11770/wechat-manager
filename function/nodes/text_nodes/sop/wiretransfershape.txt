= Wire Transfer Shape =

"""Transfers the shape of one curve to another."""

Wire Transfer Shape SOP is used to transfer the shape of curves between
two selections. The source curves are blended by a weighted average to
produce the destination curves. Weights are calculated by evaluating a
meta ball positioned at the first vertex of each curve in the source
geometry. The source and destination curves are expected to all contain
the same number of vertices.

The "Kernel Function" can be set to any available metaball kernel. The
kernels are parameterized by distance and typically give more weight to
source curves that are closer. Only the first vertex of each curve is
used in the distance calculation. The "Kernel Radius" specifies the
drop-off radius for the kernel function. As the kernel radius parameter
increases, the filter approaches uniform weighting. In cases where all
source points lie beyond the kernel radius of each metaball, the
destination curves remain unchanged.

        transferred to.
    Kernel Function:
        Interpolating  [metaball
