"""Computes a 3D metamorphosis between shapes with the same
topology."""

Blend Shapes can blend between its inputs using average weights of each
input's respective channel. It interpolates point colors and/or texture
co-ordinates between shapes.


@parameters
    Group:
        Points or primitives in the first input to be blended.
    Differencing:
        Exaggerates blends between objects where values above 1 or less
        than 0 will result in over-scaled shapes.
    Selection Index:
        #channels: /selectionidx

        Specifies which input to use when generating the cooked
        selection.
    Blend Position:
        Enables blending of point positions.
    Blend Colors:
        Enables blending of point colors and alphas.
    Blend Normals:
        Enables blending of point normals.
    Blend Texture:
        Enables blending of texture coordinates.
    Blend Voxel Data:
	Matching volumes will blend their data.  This is not done by spatial
	position, but by absolute voxel index.
    Shortest Path Transform Blending:
	Enables use of spherical linear interpolation to blend primitive
	transforms.
    Point Id Attribute:
	If this attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding points
	in the different blend shapes.  For example, using id will allow
	particle systems to find matching points even if particles are deleted.
	If it does not exist or is blank, point numbers will be used for the
	matching.
    Primitive Id Attribute:
	If this attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding
	primitives in the different blend shapes.  For example, using name
	will allow fluid systems to find matching volumes even if volumes
	are reordered.  If it does not exist or is blank, primitive numbers
	will be used for the matching.
    Assume Only Coordinate Changes In Input:
        This accelerates the blend speed when there exists an animated
        input that only has changing point positions. Unpredictable
        results will occur with this enabled if attributes or topology
        changes.
    Assume Morph Network Setup:
        This accelerates the blend speed when the inputs have the
        particular wiring the Morph tool creates. The blend speed can be
        accelerated when the following three properties are true: 
        # All of the inputs to the BlendShapes SOP after the first input are Edit SOPs. 
        # The first input to the BlendShapes SOP is the same as the first input to all of the Edit SOPs. 
        # If the Edit SOPs have a second input, they must all be the same.
    Blends:
        #channels: /shape0 /shape1 /shape2 /...

        Controls contribution of geometry inputs.
