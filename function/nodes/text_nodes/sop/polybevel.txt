= PolyBevel =

"""Bevels points and edges."""

In the simplest case of zero repetition, this node
replaces points and edges with faces. With more repetition,
it replaces those faces with more faces, leading to
smoother bevels.

This is useful for rounding off sharp edges on polygonal
geometry.
You can also use it to increase detail in facial features
by beveling edge loops around eyes and mouths.

    # To bevel corners, select the corner points. To bevel
      edges, select the edges.
    
    # Choose Poly Bevel.

NOTE:
    _Relative_ inset is calculated as a percentage of the primitive's
    size. If the original object changes size/shape, the size of the
    bevel will change. If you want the bevel to always be the same size,
    use the Absolute parameter instead.

WARNING:
    If you modify the original (upstream) geometry after creating the
    bevel node, the bevel may break.

    In this case, use the [Fuse operator|Node:sop/fuse] to re-fuse the
    points and re-apply the bevel. See  [repairing
    polygons|/model/repair_polys]  for information.

@parameters
    Group:
        The edges or points to bevel.
    Bevel Type:
        At zero repetition, all four bevel types result in identical
        outputs (that is, single surfaces are formed in place of selected
        points and edges). The difference between the bevel types is
        characterized by the way each adds detail to the resulting
        beveled faces with increasing repetition values. There are four
        bevel types:

        Flat:
            The bevel surfaces remain flat, but are divided into
            symmetric sets of new geometry.
        Low Density Round:
            Edges are rounded with additional geometry added in place of
            flat bevel surfaces with curvatures that approximate the
            original edges. Faces that replaced corners in edge and
            point beveling are substituted by minimal additional
            geometry to maintain a sense of curvature around the
            original corner. The low density round is often a better
            option than the high density round in the cases of beveling
            irregular geometry and large sets of geometry because it is
            unlikely to produce unexpected or overlapping geometry in
            the corner areas.
        High Density Round:
            Edges in the high density round bevel are treated in the
            same way as in the low density round bevel. However, faces
            that replaced corners in edge and point beveling are
            substituted by multiple quad patches between adjacent
            boundary edges. It is important to note that there is not
            necessarily continuity between patches that share a common
            boundary edge and that this lack of continuity becomes more
            apparent at higher repetitions. It is recommended that the
            subdivide sop be used for further smoothness. In the case of
            point beveling, the high density round may not be the best
            choice for obtaining a rounded corner. One alternative is to
            corner bevel the point and smooth the resulting geometry
            from the corner bevel using the divide sop.
        Corner:
            This bevel type maintains the shape of the original geometry
            while additional geometry are introduced.
            
    Default Entity:
    	With no group selection made, the default entity parameter 
    	determines if the operation bevels all points or edges of the
    	geometry. This parameter has no effect if a group is specified.
    	
    Relative Inset:
        #channels: /relinset

        Inset is interpreted as a ratio of the distance from a
        primitive's vertices to its center. This type of inset is
        bounded. It is the best choice when bevellng large sets of
        geometry, facial features, and in cases where very different
        sizes of primitives are involved.
    Absolute Inset:
        #channels: /absinset

        Inset is interpreted as an absolute length from either a vertex
        along an corresponding edge or from an edge along its
        perpendicular. This type of inset is generally not bounded. It
        is useful when beveling symmetrical geometry, small sets of
        geometry consisting of primitives with similar sizes, and in
        cases where the desired inset is explicitly known.
    Repetitions:
        #channels: /repetitions

        Repetitions is a measure of the quantity of additional geometry
        introduced. It correlates to twice the number of geometry added
        in place of an edge and to twice the number of segments each
        edge of the new face created in place of a point is divided
        into.
    Recompute Point Normals:
        Re-evaluates point normals if they exist. If this is not set,
        the point normals will be interpolated in the same manner as the
        points.
