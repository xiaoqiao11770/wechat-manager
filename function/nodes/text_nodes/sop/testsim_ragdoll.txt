"""Provides a simple Bullet simulation for testing the behavior of ragdoll."""

This asset contains a simple Bullet simulation for use while setting up the [collision geometry|Node:sop/agentcollisionlayer] and [joint limits|Node:sop/agentconfigurejoints] of a ragdoll.
This can be used to quickly observe how the ragdoll behaves under different settings.

@parameters
Display Collision Layer:
    Sets the agent's current layer to be the same as its collision layer.
    This can be used to visualize the collision geometry used by the solver.
Number of Substeps:
    Specifies the number of substeps to be used by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].
Constraint Iterations:
    Specifies the number of constraint solver iterations to be used by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].
Initial Velocity:
    The initial velocity of the ragdoll.
Initial Angular Velocity:
    The initial angular velocity of the ragdoll.
Enable Gravity:
    Controls whether gravity is enabled.
    Disabling gravity can be useful when debugging situations where agents are initially violating their rotation limits.
Gravity:
    Specifies the acceleration due to gravity.
Ground Plane Position:
    The translation of the ground plane.
Ground Plane Rotation:
    The rotation of the ground plane.
