= Round =

"""Generates round fillets of a specified radius between two surfaces."""

The Round operation generates round fillets of a specified radius
between two surfaces. It can also be used to round closed surfaces, as
it will generate spherical patches to fill in the corners.

Each surface in group one is compared with each surface in group 2. If
they come within the specified radius of each other, a rounded fillet is
generated between them. The direction of the fillet is determined by the
normal of the surfaces, modified by the Flip Fillet Direction toggles.
For best results, ensure that the normals of all surfaces face outward
from the center of the object being rounded. Note that self-fillets are
not performed, even if a surface is in both group one and two.


@parameters
    Round group 1:
        Subset of NURBS and Bezier surfaces
    Round group 2:
        Subset of NURBS and Bezier surfaces
    3D Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol3d

        World space precision of fillet
    2D Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol2d

        Domain space precision of fillet
    Marching Steps:
        #channels: /step

        Number of steps for tracing each profile span
    Radius:
        #channels: /radius

        Radius of the fillet
    Span Density:
        #channels: /spans

        Density to build fillet. Higher densities will provide a more
        accurate rounded fillet at the expense of more geometry. The
        actual number of isoparms in the fillet is a function of this,
        the radius, and the length of the fillet.
    Flip Left Fillet Direction:
        #channels: /flipnorma

        Logically flip normals of left surfaces
    Flip Right Fillet Direction:
        #channels: /flipnormb

        Logically flip normals of right surfaces
    Trim Primitives:
        #channels: /trimedges

        Try to cut surfaces back to the fillet
    Cusp Angle:
        #channels: /angle

        Angle at which a sharp corner is made
