"""Manually adds or removes a creaseweight attribute to/from polygon
edges, for use with the Subdivide SOP."""

This operator adds the creaseweight attribute to specific edges in the
input geometry so they will crease when you convert to subdivision
surfaces with the [Subdivide SOP|Node:sop/subdivide].

@parameters
Group:
    The edges to crease.

    Normally you will use this operator in the viewer and simply
    select the edges you want; however, if you need to you can also
    use a space-separated list of the following codes in this field
    to specify edges:

    [Include:edgespec]

Operation:
    How this node affects any creaseweight values already on the
    edges.


    Add To Existing Value:
        Add the __Crease value__ below to the existing value.
    Set:
        Replaces any existing crease with the __Crease value__
        below.
    Delete:
        Remove any existing crease value.
Crease:
    #channels: /crease

    Value to add/set for the creaseweight attribute.

Add Vertex Color:
    Adds color to creased vertices to make them easy to recognize in
    the viewer.
