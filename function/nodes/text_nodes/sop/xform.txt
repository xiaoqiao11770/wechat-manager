"""The Transform operation transforms the source geometry in "object space" using a transformation matrix."""

The Transform operation transforms the source geometry in "object space" using a transformation matrix.

All primitives selected will receive the same transform.  To vary the transform by a point attribute, use the [Transform By Attribute SOP|Node:sop/xformbyattrib].


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to transform.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
    Transform Order:
        Order in which transformations occur.
    Rotate Order:
        Order in which rotations occur.
    Translate:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Amount of translation along xyz axes.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Amount of rotation about xyz axes.
    Scale:
        #channels: /sx /sy /sz

        Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.
    Shear:
        Amount of shearing. The three values represent shearing in the
        X direction on the XY plane, in the X direction on the XZ plane,
        and in the Y direction on the YZ plane, respectively.
    Pivot:
        #channels: /px /py /pz

        Local pivot point for transformations.
    Uniform Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Uniform scaling.

    Attributes:
        These attributes are transformed, if they are marked as transforming.
        Use [Attribute Create|Node:sop/attribcreate] to set the transformation type on an attribute to __Position__, __Vector__, __Normal__, __Quaternion__, or __Transform Matrix__. Set the type to __None__ to make an attribute non-transforming, or
        remove it from this list.  Primitive transforms are affected if and only if `P` is transformed.
    Recompute Point Normals:
        Recomputes all normals as point normals, if a normal attribute exists.
    Recompute Affected Normals:
        Recomputes any normals that are affected by polygons that use both transformed and untransformed points. When transforming the full geometry or full connected components, the results should be the same as when this option is off, i.e. the normals will just be transformed and not recomputed. This does nothing if `P` is not being transformed.
    Preserve Normal Length:
        Normal lengths remain unaffected.
    Invert Transformation:
        Use the inverse of the transformation. This is the transformation which undoes the specified transformation. Two transform SOPs with all parameters but this equal will cancel out each other's transformation.
