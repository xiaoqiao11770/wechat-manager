= UV Pelt =

"""Relaxes UVs by pulling them out toward the edges of the texture area."""

UVPelt operates very similar to how a tanner
creates a pelt. Cuts are made to the geometry to produce a surface
topologically equivalent to a disc. The boundaries of this surface are
connected to a frame and stretched out.

Any closed face can be used as a frame for the pelt. A circle is used if
no frame is specified. A hint polygon is used to specify which section
of the geometry to pelt after performing the cuts. The boundary with an
edge closest to the hint polygon is the one connected to the frame. The
frame is parameterized to the range `[0, 1)`. The boundary points are
spaced around the frame at distances in the frame's parameterization
that are proportional to the edge length with the neighboring boundary
point.

[Include:texture_common#visualizePara]

UVPelt creates the UV texture attribute if it does not already exist.
The attribute class (Vertices or Points) is determined by the Target
Type. It is recommended that UVs be applied to vertices, since this
allows fine control on polygonal geometry and the ability to fix seams
at the boundary of a texture.

NOTE:
    UVPelt only operates on polygons. Other geometry type such as Bezier
    and NURBS surfaces can be converted to polygons using a Convert
    operation prior to applying UVPelt.

            #channels: /orientation

            Specifies where on the frame to position the first boundary
            point (the boundary point closest to the hint polygon).
        Weight Attribute:
            #channels: /weight

            Specifies an attribute of the frame's points that will guide
            the process of connecting boundary points to the frame.
