"""Imports option and record data from DOP simulations into points with
point attributes."""

The DOP Import Records SOP will import option, field, and record data
from a DOP simulation into SOPs.  It creates a point for each
record imported and sets the attributes of that point to the
values from the source.

Each imported field will create an attribute of that field name.
If the same field name shows up in different data with different types,
the first type controls what sort of attribute is created.  This
may mean the later types will not be imported if they are not compatible.

Several standard attributes are always created to make it easier
to track the origin of the point data:

`objname`: The name of the object the record comes from.

`objid`: The unique identifier for the source object.

`datapath`: The path to the data which contains the record.

`recordname`: The name of the record.

`recordnum`: A given named record may have many entries.  For example, the Impact
data will have one for each impact.  This stores which record in the list
generated the point.

@parameters

DOP Network:
    #id: doppath

    The DOP Network to extract the records from.
Object Mask:
    #id: objpattern

    Specifies the objects within the DOP Network to extract the
    records from.
Data Path:
    #id: datapath

    The subdata path for the data to import records from the DOP
    Network. The same data path will be used for all source objects.
     This can be a list or globbed expression.
Record:
     Which type of record to extract from the matched data.
     The most common record is Options.  This contains the
     information returned by the `dopoption` hscript command and
     usually has all the parameters set on the data from the DOP network.

     Another useful record is Impacts to extract the impact data
     from the Impacts or Feedback data.

     This can be a globbed expression.
Fields:
     Which fields to extract from matched records.  This can
     be a globbed expression.

Position Field:
     If an extracted field matches this field, and it is a
     floating point field, it will overwrite the position of the
     generated point.  If more than one field matches, the result
     is undefined.

     This can be a globbed expression.
