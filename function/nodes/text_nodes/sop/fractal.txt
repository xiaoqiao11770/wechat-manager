"""Creates jagged mountain-like divisions of the input
geometry."""

This node will create random-looking deviations and sub-divisions
along either a specified normal vector (the Direction xyz fields) or the
vertex normals of the input geometry. This is great for the creation of
terrains and landscapes.

This node works on polygons or meshes.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of geometry to apply the fractal effect to.

Divisions:
    #id: divs

    Number of subdivisions of the Source geometry.

Smoothness:
    #id: smooth

    Inversely scales the deviations per division.

Scale:
    #id: scale

    Scales amplitude of deviations.

Seed:
    #id: seed

    Seeds the random number generator.

Fixed Boundary:
    Prevents boundary edges from being fractalized.

Use Vertex Normals:
    Sets direction of fractalization to direction of source
    normals.

Direction:
    #id: dir

    Direction of the fractalization.
