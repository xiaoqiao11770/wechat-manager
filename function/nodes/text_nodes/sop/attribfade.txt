"""Fades a point attribute in and out over time."""

The Attrib Fade operator scales a point attribute into and out of existence
over a given time range.  This can be useful for triggering the input to
a dynamic simulation, for example fading a fuel map in and out.

Additional point attributes can be used to control the fade start
and length times on a per point basis.

@parameters
    Visualize Fade:
	Sets the color attribute (`Cd`) to the fade value for
	fast visualization of what is going on.
    Point Group:
	The points in the first input that will be faded.

    == Attributes ==

	Fade:
	    The attribute whose values will be faded.  If this attribute
	    doesn't exist, the initial value will be 1.  The result
	    of this node is to set this attribute to the faded value.
	
	Fade Start Frame:
	    This attribute controls the start of the fading for each point.  If
	    not present, a frame start of 0 (modified by the frame offset in
	    the timings tab) is used.

	    If the second input is wired, this attribute is read from
	    the second input.  Otherwise it is fetched from the first.
	
	Start Frame Retime:
	    Retimes the fade start attribute.  The default 0-1 causes the
	    attribute to be measured in frames.  Setting it to 1, `$FPS` will
	    measure in seconds.

	Hold Frame Scale:
	    This point attribute scales the __Fade Hold Frames__ timing parameter.
	    If not present, a value of 1 is used.

	    If the third input is wired, this attribute is read from
	    the third input.  Otherwise it is fetched from the first.

    == Timings ==

	Frame Offset:
	    This is added to the __Fade Start Frame__ to control when fading
	    begins.  Note this is when the Fade In begins, not when the hold is
	    reached. So, if you want to measure the time when the maximal
	    fade value is reached, rather than when the fading begins, this
	    should be negative __Fade in Frames__.

	Fade In Frames:
	    How long the fade in process should take.

	Fade Hold Frames:
	    For this many frames the full fade value will be held.

	Fade out Frames:
	    How long the fade out process should take.

	Fade In Ramp:
	    This ramp describes how the fade attribute changes over the fade in
	    time period.

	Fade Out Ramp:
	    This ramp describes how the fade attribute changes over the fade
	    out time period.
