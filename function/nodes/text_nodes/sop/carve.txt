"""Slices, cuts or extracts points or cross-sections from a
primitive."""

The Carve op works with any face or surface type, be that polygon,
Bezier, or NURBS. It can be used to slice a primitive, cut it into
multiple sections, or extract points or cross-sections from it.

Like the [Project SOP|Node:sop/project], it also creates profile curves,
but they are extracted as iso-parametric (2D) profiles directly from a
surface, whereas the [Project SOP|Node:sop/project] extracts a 3D curve
projected onto a surface.

NOTE:
    When using a Carve op on a trimmed surface, you can't fillet or join
    the trim curves.

== Tips ==

Opening a Closed Primitive:

    Given a closed surface, it can be converted to an identical open
    surface at any location by using the Carve op, and cutting at a
    single location (e.g. First U enabled, Second U disabled). The
    same is true for faces.

Dicing a Face or Surface:

    Select the Cut operation, First U = 0, Second U = 1, First V =
    0, Second V = 1, with (at least) three divisions for U and V.
    This will dice the surface into (at least) 3 x 3 components.
    This can later be used with the [Primitive
    SOP|Node:sop/primitive] to "explode" the surface.

Cutting a Hole in a Surface:

    Select the Cut operation, First U = 0.33, Second U = 0.66, First
    V = 0.33, Second V = 0.66, 2 divisions for U and V. Keep Inside
    is off, Keep Outside is on. This will cut a rectangular region
    from the center of the surface.

Animating a Point Over a Face or Surface:

    Select the Extract option, First U = x, Last U disabled, First V
    = y, Last V disabled, Extract Point is on, Keep Primitives is
    optional. This will create a point over any position on the
    surface (0<=x<=1, 0<=y<=1).

@parameters
    Group:
        Specifies a subset of primitives to carve.
    First U:
        #channels: /domainu1

        Starting location in the U direction.
    Second U:
        #channels: /domainu2

        Ending location for the operation.
    U Divisions:
        #channels: /divsu

        Number of cuts/extracts to be performed.
    Cut At All Internal U Breakpoints:
        Cut only at ends or along all internal breakpoints. Only At
        Breakpoints must be toggled.
    First V:
        #channels: /domainv1

        Starting location in the V direction.
    Second V:
        #channels: /domainv2

        Ending location for the operation.
    V Divisions:
        #channels: /divsv

        Number of cuts/extracts to be performed.
    Cut At All Internal V Breakpoints:
        Cut only at ends or along all internal breakpoints. Only At
        Breakpoints must be toggled.
    Cut:
        Splits primitive at locations specified above.
    Keep Inside:
        Keeps the primitives between First and Second U.
    Keep Outside:
        Keeps the primitives outside First and Second U.
    Extract:
        Extracts points, cross-sections, or curves-on-surface along each
        location specified above. Only points can be extracted from a
        face and the V parameter has no effect. Extraction of
        cross-sections and curves-on surface is possible only if the
        primitive is a surface.
    Keep Original:
        Will keep the original primitive from being removed.
    Only At Breakpoints:
        Perform the operation only at breakpoints for NURBS and Bezier
        surfaces or faces and at vertices for polygonal faces and
        surfaces.
