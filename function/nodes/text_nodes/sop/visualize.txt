"""Lets you attach visualizations to different nodes in a geometry network."""

== Overview ==

While the [visualization interface|/basics/visualizers] lets you attach visualizations to specific nodes, sometimes you want to move the same visualization around to different nodes in a geometry network to inspect the geometry as it moves through the network. This node lets you do that by attaching visualizers to this node, then using a shortcut key to move this node around the network quickly.

== How to ==

# Hover over a geometry node in the network editor and press ((X)). Houdini will wire a visualize node onto that node and set the display flag.

# Use the controls on the visualize node's __Visualizers__ tab or the [visualizers interface|/basics/visualizers] to set up the visualization.

# Hover over various nodes in the network and press ((X)). The visualize node will automatically move and rewire as you go.

TIP:
    Pressing ((X)) again on the node with the visualize attached will unwire the visualize node.

@parameters

Clear Incoming Visualizers:
    Don't show any visualizers that were already on the node the visualize node is wired to. (Technically, this clears the `visualizers` attribute on the incoming geometry.)
