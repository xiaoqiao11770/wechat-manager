"""Transfers groups between two pieces of geometry, based on
proximity."""

GroupTransfer is used to transfer primitive, point, and edge groups between two
selections. Closest proximity is used to map primitives/points/edges in the
destination to primitives/points/edges in the source. Those that map to
primitives/points/edges in the selected source groups are included in their
respective destination group. If the source group is ordered then the
destination group will also be ordered. The order is determined by the
order of the mapped primitive/point/edge. Those that map to the same
primitive/point/edge are further ordered by their proximity.

New destination groups are created with the same names as their source
group counterparts. The names can have an optional prefix. If a group in
the destination selection shares the same name as the proposed name then
a number of methods are available to resolve the conflict. The transfer
process can be skipped for that particular group in conflict, the
existing group can be overwritten, or a numerical suffix can be appended
to the name of the new destination group. The suffix starts at 2 and
increments by 1 until a unique name is found.

@parameters
Primitive Groups:
    Source primitive groups to transfer.  Leaving this empty is equivalent
    to `*`.

Primitive Group Prefix:
    Destination primitive group name prefix.

Point Groups:
    Source point groups to transfer.  Leaving this empty is equivalent to `*`.

Point Group Prefix:
    Destination point group name prefix.

Edge Groups:
    Source edge groups to transfer. Leaving this empty is equivalent to `*`.

Edge Group Prefix:
    Destination edge group name prefix.
Group Name Conflict:
    Methods to resolve destination group name conflicts.

    Skip Group:
        Conflicted source group not transferred.
    Overwrite:
        Already existing group overwritten.
    Add Suffix:
        Unique numerical suffix added.

Distance Threshold:
    Minimum distance requirement for destination point/primitive/edge to
    source.

Create Groups Even If Empty:
    When enabled, groups that will be empty will still be created.
    When disabled, these groups will not be created.
