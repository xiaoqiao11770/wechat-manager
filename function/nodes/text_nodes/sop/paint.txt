= Paint =

"""Lets you paint color or other attributes on geometry."""

* In the viewer, choose the Paint SOP, select the surface you want to
  paint on and press ((RMB)) to finish the selection. Then you can move
  the brush over the surface and press the mouse buttons to paint.

* You have two colors: the foreground (__FG__, ((LMB))) and background
  (__BG__, ((MMB))).

* Use the controls on the operation controls toolbar to set the foreground color
  (__FG__), background color (__BG__), radius, and opacity.

* Press ((RMB)) to show a menu of tool options. You can assign
  different operations to ((LMB)) and ((MMB)) (see the __Operation__
  parameter).

* See the  [brush tools help|/basics/brush]  for more information.


TIP:
    To paint an arbitrary attribute instead of color, turn on __Override
    color__ and set the attribute name.

TIP:
    To see the surface colors without lighting affecting the colors,
    do the following:
    
    # Create a VEX Constant shader and [assign it to the object|/shade].
    # In the parameter editor for the shader, click the
      [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] Gear menu and choose __Edit Rendering Parameters__.
    # In the __Render Properties__ tab, open `SHOP Options > OGL` and drag the
      "Use Lighting" property over to the __Existing Parameters__ side to
      add it to the shader's interface.
    # Click __Accept__.
    # In the shader's parameter editor, turn off __Use Lighting__.

@parameters

    == Operation ==

        Operation:
            The operation used by Apply To All.

            Paint:
                Paints your new color onto the geometry.
            Eye Dropper:
                sets the foreground color to the color nearest the
                center of your brush.
            Smooth:
                Blends the colors of points under the brush.
            Erase Changes:
                Restores the colors under the brush to the pre-paint
                values.
            NOTE:
                This parameter only affects the flood fill options. To change the current paint mode, ((RMB)) in the viewport and select the operation for ((LMB)) or ((MMB)).
                
        Merge Mode:
            How the color is to be applied to the surface.

            Replace:
                The result is a blend between the original color and
                the brush color according to the brush alpha.
            Add:
                The scaled brush color is added to the original
                geometry color.
            Subtract:
                The scaled brush color is subtracted from the original
                geometry color.
            Multiply:
                The result of multiplying the brush color by the
                original geometry color is blended into the original
                color by the brush opacity.
            Screen:
		        The colors are mixed together in an additive manner
		        that clamps at one.  This only really works if the
		        existing color and painted color are in the 0..1 range.
            Hue:
                The hue of the original color is replaced by that of
                the brush color. The result is blended into the
                original color.
            Saturation:
                The saturation of the original color is changed to that
                of the brush color. The result is then blended into the
                original color.
            Lightness:
                The lightness of the original color is changed to the
                brush color. The result is then blended with the
                original color.
            Red:
                Replace only the red (first) channel.
            Green:
                Replace only the green (second) channel.
            Blue:
                Replace only the blue (third) channel.
            Invert:
                Does not use the brush color. Instead, does a replace
                operation with the inverse (1.0 - orig) of the original
                color.
            Custom:
                When in custom mode, the brush color will be
                re-evaluated for every point. The evaluated color is
                then blended using replace semantics. Local variables
                are present, so you can paint with ($BBX, $BBY, $BBZ).
                
        Accumulate To Stencil:
            See  [about accumulate to stencil|/basics/brush] . By
            default, the operation is applied and the stencil cleared
            after every brush stroke. When this option is on, Houdini
            does not apply the stencil until you click __Apply and Clear
            Stencil__.
            
        Apply & Clear Stencil:
            Applies the operation and clears the stencil. This is
            equivalent to right-clicking in the viewport.
            
        Foreground/Background:
            #channels: /fg /bg

            Colors to apply unless bitmap stamping is enabled. If
            __Accumulate To Stencil__ is on, the left mouse does
            foreground and the middle mouse erases.
            
        Stamp Bitmap Instead Of FG/BG Color:
            If set, the color channels of the bitmap are used directly
            rather than the brush color.
            
        Apply To All:
            Paints all of the selected geometry.
            
        Operation for All:
            Operation to use for __Apply to All__.

            You can not use this parameter to switch the Paint SOP into other operations. You can only use the ((RMB)) in the viewport to set these operations. 

            For example, if you set this parameter to __Erase Changes__, but the ((RMB)) menu is set to __Paint__, this parameter will switch to __Paint__ as soon as you click in the viewport.

        Reset All Changes:
            Restores geometry to initial state.
            
        Create Missing Color And Alpha Attributes:
            Adds the `Cd` and `Alpha` point attributes if not present
            and not overridden and required.
            
        Accumulate Alpha:
            When set gives a paint-on-glass effect. The painting on the
            surface will increase the alpha, so painted areas become
            visible. Note this has no effect on areas with alpha of
            one.
            
            Alpha values are _accumulated_, so you probably want to reset
            the `Alpha` attribute to `0` using a
            [Point node|Node:sop/point] before the Paint node.
            
        Override Color:
            If enabled, lets you paint values of the specified attribute
            instead of the default `Cd` (diffuse color).
            
            Only `Cd` and `Alpha` affect the display of surfaces in the
            viewport (and __Transparency__ on the __Misc__ tab of the
            [display options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] must be on to
            see `Alpha`). The __Override color__ and __Override Alpha__
            options let you paint alternate attributes, but they won't
            automatically show up as color and transparency in the 
            viewport like `Cd` and `Alpha` do. (You can use
            __Visualize attribute__ to show a non-color attribute as
            false colors.)
            
        Override Alpha:
            If __Accumulate alpha__ is on, this node will use the `Alpha`
            attribute to accumulate alpha data (based on the opacity of the
            brush). If enabled, this parameter stores the stroke opacity data
            in the specified attribute instead of the default `Alpha`,
            similarly to __Override color__.
            
            You could instead use __Override color__ set to `Alpha` to
            paint directly into the Alpha channel. In that case, the value
            of the color would be set as the alpha value, instead of the
            opacity of the brush being accumulated.
            
        Visualize Attribute:
            Whether to do a false color visualization of the overridden
            attribute and what range to map to. See also
            [visualizing attributes|/basics/attributevisualization].
            
        Visualize Mode:
            How to map the attribute value to a color.
            
    The Paint SOP uses the `Cd` attribute to store color data. The __Override Color__ parameter lets you specify a different attribute to use for the color data. Similarly, if __Accumulate Alpha__ is enabled, the Paint SOP will use the `Alpha` attribute to accumulate alpha data. The __Override Alpha__ parameter lets you specify a different attribute to use for the alpha data. Alpha values are accumulated so you often wish to initialize the Alpha value to 0.

    NOTE:
        If the geometry contains attributes named `Cd` and `Alpha`, they will be used when rendering in the viewport. Overriding the names in the Paint SOP let you manipulate a different set of attributes but the viewport will only recognize `Cd` and `Alpha` as having special meaning.
