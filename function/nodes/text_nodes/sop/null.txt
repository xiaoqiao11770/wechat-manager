= Null =

"""Does nothing."""

This operation does nothing. It acts simply as a placeholder to make
wiring networks easier, or to allow you to reference a single output SOP
without having to update all the references to it if the real output SOP
changes.

This SOP passes through its input untouched, so it does no cooking.
Adding a null does not increase memory usage
(except when "Cache Input" is on).

@parameters
    Copy Input:
	Disabling this flag will cause the Null SOP to cook its input,
	but not copy the result.  This is useful if you want to enforce
	the cooking of a node at a certain time, but are not interested
	in the result.  You can use a [Merge SOP|Node:sop/merge] to collect a lot
	of dependencies into a single input this way.
    Cache Input:
        If this flag is turned on, then the null will cache its input.
        This makes it possible to unload the Null SOP's input.
        This flag is off by default.
