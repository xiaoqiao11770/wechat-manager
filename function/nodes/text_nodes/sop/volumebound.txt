= Volume Bound =

"""Bounds voxel data."""

This node computes the bounds of voxels that meet a certain
requirement.

A volume-aligned bounding box is made.  All of the voxels inside of
this bounding box will match the desired region settings.  For
example, a value greater than 0.1 will create a bounding box that contains
all the voxels whose value is greater than 0.1.

TIP:
    The bounding box is conservative, so it includes voxels that don't meet the condition.

Voxel values are stored at the center of the voxels, but by default are bound at the edges. Whether a voxel is included in the region is based on the value at the center.

This grid represents voxels. The voxel values are stored in the centre of the voxels and are represented by points. The three boxes represent the bound created based on different values in the __Voxel Padding__ parameter.

* A value of 0, 0, 0 will give you the default red region bounding box.
* A value of -0.5, -0.5, -0.5 will create a bound on the center of the voxels, represented by the inner grey region.
* A value of 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 will create a bound represented by the outer grey region. This type of bound ensures that all evaluated values meet the condition inside the box when trilinearly sampled.

Incoming geometry isn't copied, and if no voxels match the condition, no bounding box is built.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of primitives to bound.
    Region to Find:
	The region of voxels to look for: either the bound of voxels
	greater than the bounding value, or the bound of those less.
    Bounding Value:
	The value to compare voxel values against to see if they
	are valid to include in the bounding region.
    Voxel Padding:
	The region will be expanded by this number of voxels.  To
	bound on the center of voxels rather than the edges, use
	-0.5, -0.5, -0.5.
