"""Scatters new guides, interpolating the properties of existing guides."""

[Include:/shelf/reguide#includeme]

@parameters

Group:
        The group of primitives to scatter guides on.

Density Scale:
        Multiplier against the points per area to generate.

Density Attribute:
        Attribute controlling the density of scattered points.

Relax Iterations:
        Number of iterations to use when relaxing point spacing. Higher Values result in more even spacing of guides.

Only Display Roots:
        Don't generate and interpolate guides, just scatter roots. Since the guide generation can be quite slow, this can be used to quickly visualize and dial in density.

Max Source Guides:
        The maximum number of source guides to interpolate for each created guide.

Distance Bias:
        Control over the weighting of source guides based on distance. The higher the value, the faster the influence of source guides is weakened with distance. A value of 0 results in guides being averaged, disregarding distance completely.
