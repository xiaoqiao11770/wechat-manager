= PolySplit =

"""Divides an existing polygon into multiple new polygons."""

This node can handle a chain of cuts, possible self-intersecting, as well as cuts between non-adjacent polygons.

The new polygons that are created preserve vertex and primitive attributes of the polygon from which they were cut. Group memberships are also preserved.

A cut made from one end vertex to another end vertex of an open polygon will close the polygon.

Cuts can be made to positions inside a polygon only if the polygon is closed, an initial edge or vertex is selected, and the viewport is in a non-wireframe mode.

If only one split location is specified and both __Quad Strips__ and __Close Path__ are used, PolySplit will try to find a closed loop around the quad strip.

@parameters
    Split Locations:
        Specifies the chain of locations along which to make cuts. The
        list of locations is separated by a space and can be specified
        in the following ways:

        avb:
            Cut at vertex b of primitive a where a and b are integers.
            (e.g. 0v3)
        aeb:
            Cut at the midpoint of edge b of primitive a where a and b
            are integers. (e.g. 0e3)
        aeb:t:
            Cut at t percent along the edge b of primitive a where a and
            b are integers and t is a real number between 0.0 and 1.0.
            (e.g. 0e3:0.7 will cut at 70% along the edge 3 of primitive
            0)
	af:u,v:
	    Cut at the point on primitive a at location (u,v), where u
	    and v are real numbers between 0.0 and 1.0. (e.g 0f:0.5,0.5
	    will cut to a point in the center of primitive 0)
        pa-b:
            Cut at the midpoint of the edge between points a and b,
            where a and b are integers. (e.g. p1-3)
        pa-b:t:
            Cut at t percent along the edge between points a and b,
            where a and b are integers. (e.g. p1-3:0.7)
    Path Type:
        Specifies the algorithm used to find the desired path. Please
        see above for a description of the algorithms.
    Override Bias:
        Specifies an overriding value for cut locations made along
        edges, even for those where the midpoint is used by default.
    Update Point Normals:
        Update point normals if they exist.
    Close Path:
        Causes an extra cut to be made from the last split location to
        the first.
    Tolerance:
        Tolerance used when performing geometric calculations.
