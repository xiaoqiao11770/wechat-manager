= Transform Pieces =

"""Transforms input geometry according to transformation attributes on template geometry."""

The Transform Pieces SOP can be used to transform input geometry according to
transformation attributes on the template geometry, according to the rules and
precedences described in [Copy and Instancing operations |/copy/instanceattrs].
The template geometry to use for each piece of input geometry is determined by
by attributes on the geometries and the __Attribute Mode__ parameter.

This node can be used in combination with a [Dop Import node|Node:sop/dopimport] in
__Create Points to Represent Objects__ mode to transform the results of a multi-piece RBD
simulation.

@inputs
    Geometry to Transform:
        The geometry to transform.

    Template Points:
        Input points whose attributes are used to transform the geometry.

    Rest Points:
        Optional input points whose attributes define the rest space transform
        for each piece of input geometry.  The input geometry will first be
        transformed to rest space using the inverse of this transform before
        any further transformations are applied.  The number and order of
        these points must match the __Template Points__ input.

@parameters
Attribute Mode:
    Index by Attribute:
        The attribute is an integer that holds the template point number, and
        is used as an index into the template geometry.
    Match by Attribute:
        The integer or string attribute is used to match input and template geometry
        with equal values.
Attribute:
    The name of the attribute used for indexing or matching.  This should be
    a point or primitive attribute.
Point Velocities:
    Controls whether point velocities will be calculated for the geometry from this SOP,
    and the method of calculation. The Instantaneous and Integrated velocity calculations
    are described in [Point Velocities|/nodes/sop/dopimport#id272437].
Integrate Over Time:
    The time interval over which velocities are calculated when using the Integrated Point
    Velocities calculation. This value should be set to a single frame time, or the
    duration of a single geometry segment when using multi-segment motion blur.
Copy Template Attributes:
    Copy attribute values from the template points to the transformed geometry points.
Attributes to Copy:
    The attributes to copy from the template points to the transformed geometry points.
