"""Reads sample data from a chop and converts it into point positions
and point attributes."""

This node is complementary to the
[Geometry CHOP|Node:chop/geometry]. The Channels created by the
[Geometry CHOP|Node:chop/geometry] can be modified and then re-inserted
into the op network via a Channel SOP.

This does what a [Point SOP|Node:sop/point] with a `chopci()` function can
do, but is much faster.

There are two different ways of importing attribute values, 
controlled by the  __Method__ parameter. Each method requires that the CHOP 
channels are set up in a specific way.

The  __Static__ method is used for modeling a surface without any animation. 
A single channel is required for each attribute component, and its length must
be the number of points in the geometry or specified point group(s). 
To modify `P` in a geometry with 100 points, three channels with 100 samples 
would be required.

The second method, __Animated__, provides animation for the attribute. 
There must be one set of channels for each attribute component, and this set
must be indexed from 0 to the number of points minus one, by adding a numeric
suffix. For the attributes `Cd Alpha` with 3 points, you would need 
`r0 g0 b0 a0 r1 g1 b1 a1 r2 g2 b2 a2`.  The length of the channels determines 
the animation length.

The Channel SOP can also update portions of the geometry. By using point groups
from the incoming op, the channels can be inserted only into the groups' points.
To modify only some components of a vector, use brackets to specify the 
component index (_P(1)_ refers to the Y value of the point position). 

@parameters

Group:
    Modify only the points within this point group. If blank, all
    points are modified.

CHOP:
    Retrieves the sample data from this CHOP.

Method:
    The sample data fetch method.

    Static:
        Uses one channel for each attribute, and all points use this
        channel (the first point resides at index 0, the next at 1,
        and so on). The length of the channels should be at least
        the number of points modified.
    
    Animated:
        Uses one channel per attribute per point. The channels show
        the animation of each point's position/attribute values. The channels
        must have a numeric suffix starting at zero, with at least one channel 
	for each point. For vector attributes, there should be one channel per
	component, per point (eg. for the `P` attribute, the channels must 
        follow the pattern `tx0 ty0 tz0 tx1 ty1 tz1 tx2 ty2 tz2...`).

Channel Scope:
    The names of the CHOP channels that will modify the attributes. There must
    be at least one channel name per attribute. Vector attributes may require 
    multiple channels for all components specified in the __Attribute Scope__  
    (eg. an attribute scope of `P` should have a channel scope with three 
     names, such as `tx ty tz`, whereas `P(1)` only needs one, `ty`).

Attribute Scope:
    A string list of attributes to modify. For only one component of
    an array, such as the Y value of the point position, specify the
    number of elements in brackets (in this case, `P(1)` would be
    used).

    The common attributes are:

    table>>
        tr>>
            td>> P
            td>> Point position (X, Y, Z), 3 values
        tr>>
            td>> Pw
            td>> Point weight, 1 value
        tr>>
            td>> Cd
            td>> Point color (red, green, blue), 3 values
        tr>>
            td>> Alpha
            td>> Point alpha, 1 value
        tr>>
            td>> N
            td>> Point normal value (X, Y, Z), 3 values
        tr>>
            td>> uv
            td>> Point texture coordinates (U,V,W), 3 values

Organize by Attribute:
    #id: organize
    
    (Applies to 'Animated Method' only.)
    Will reorganize the fetched channels by the value of this
    attribute. A common example is the `id` attribute found in
    particles. A channel is built for each unique id since the
    number of points may vary.
