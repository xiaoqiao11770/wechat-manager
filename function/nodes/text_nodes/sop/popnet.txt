= POP Network =

"""Contains a Particle node network."""

This node lets you embed a particle network inside
a Geometry object.
See [particle network nodes|/nodes/pop/].

You can reference any geometry you connect to this node's inputs
as "context geometry" inside the particle network.

The DOP Import tab lets you override the output of the SOP with the
result of a DOP Pop Geometry.

    DOP Network:
        The DOP Network to extract the particle system from.  If
        blank, will not attempt to extract anything.
    Object Mask:
        Specifies the objects within the DOP Network to extract the
        simulation from.  Only the first object matching will be used.
    Geometry Data Path:
        The name of the subdata that contains the pop simulation to
        extract from DOPs.  It should be of type POP Geometry.
