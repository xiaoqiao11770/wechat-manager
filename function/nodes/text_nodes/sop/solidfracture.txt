= Solid Fracture =

"""Creates a partition of a tetrahedral mesh that can be used for finite-element fracturing."""

The Solid Fracture SOP divides up the geometry into pieces, each of which consists of primitives that cannot be broken apart by the finite element solver. The primitives are represented by a primitive attribute `fracturepart` that has a distinct number for each unbreakable part. The geometry with the `fracturepart` attribute can then be used as the __Initial Geometry__ on the [Node:dop/solidobject].

Doing finite-element fracturing sims without `fracturepart` is likely to result in breakage of individual tets. It is recommended that you use the Solid Fracture asset or that you create a `fracturepart` attribute manually in order to specify the smallest pieces that should stay together.

This asset works for polygons as well as tetrahedrons. This means that the asset can not only be used for fracturing Solid Object sims, but also for fracturing [Node:dop/clothobject] simulations (tearing).

@parameters

Part Scale:
    This specifies the scale of the fracture parts. The larger this parameter, the larger the fracture parts will be.

Pattern Offset:
    This allows you to shift the position of the pattern that is used to create the parts.
    
Visualize Piece:
    This allows you to see the parts as colors.
