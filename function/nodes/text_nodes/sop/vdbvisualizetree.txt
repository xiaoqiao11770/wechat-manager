"""Replaces a VDB volume with geometry that visualizes its structure."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node may be useful to experts for checking if the VDB volume is wasting memory.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of VDB primitives in the input to visualize.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Tree Nodes:
    Which tree nodes to draw.
    Note that the _meaning of colors in the visualization changes_ depending on this setting.
    
    Disabled:
        Do not draw any tree nodes.

    Leaf Nodes:
        Draw the leaf nodes as wireframe boxes.
        Default nodes are orange, non-default nodes are blue.
    
    All Non-Constant Nodes:
        Draw all nodes.
        Leaf nodes are blue, internal nodes are orange, top-level nodes are green.
    
Active Constant Tiles:
    Draw nodes that are active but hold the default (empty) value.
    Positive values are red, negative values are white.

    Disabled:
        Do not draw constant active tiles.
    
    Points:
        Draw a single point in the middle of each constant node.

    Points with Values:
        Draw a point with a point attribute (based on the primitive name) containing the value of the node.

    Wireframe Box:
        Draw a wireframe box around constant nodes.

    Solid Box:
        Draw a solid box around constant nodes.

Active Voxels:
    Active voxels are visualized.
    They are colored red if positive valued, white if negative valued.
            
    Disabled:
        Do not draw constant active voxels.

    Points:
        Draw a single point in the middle of each constant
        voxel.

    Points with Values:
        Draw a point with a point attribute (based on the primitive name) containing the value of the node.

    Wireframe Box:
        Draw a wireframe box around active nodes.

    Solid Box:
        Draw a solid box around active nodes.

Preview Frustrums:
    If the VDB primitive was created based on a frustum, draw the frustum bounding box.
    See the "Frustum" and "From camera" modes of the [VDB node|Node:sop/vdb].
