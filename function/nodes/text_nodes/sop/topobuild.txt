"""Lets you interactively draw a reduced quad mesh automatically snapped to existing geometry."""

== Overview ==

:vimeo: TopoBuild
    #id: 142306098

This node is useful when you have a very high-resolution model and want to create a much lower-resolution model from it. You can draw the quads of the new mesh by hand, automatically snapping the corners to the existing surface.

== How to ==

:task:Start using the tool:
    # Select the geometry you want to use as the template.
    
    # On the __Model__ shelf, click [Icon:SOP/topobuild] Topo Build.
    
        The tool creates a new [Geometry object|Node:obj/geo] for the new surface. It imports the selected surface into the new object.
    
    # Click four points on the template surface to create the first face.

:task:Draw new quads:
    * Click an existing point to start drawing a new quad.
    
    # Click the other three corners to finish the new quad.
    
        Drawing automatically snaps to existing points.

:task:Extend edges:
    * Click an edge to start creating new faces from the edge.
    
    * You can click multiple times to create a strip of new quads.
    
    * You can ((Shift))-drag to scale or ((Ctrl))-drag to rotate the edges before you click to place them.
    
    * Press ((Esc)) or click ((MMB)) to stop adding.

:task:Create free points to snap to:
    Click outside existing quads.

:task:Select points/edges:
    * To select a free point, click it.
    
    * To select a point that's part of a quad, click it and then press ((Esc)) to cancel drawing.
    
    * To select an edge, click it and then press ((Esc)) to cancel extending. You can use [edge loop selection|/basics/select#edges].
    
    * To select additional points/edges, hold ((Shift)) and click them.

:task:Move existing points/edges:
    Drag existing points or edges to move them across the template surface.

:task:Temporarily disable snapping:
    Hold ((Ctrl)) and click to disable automatically snapping to existing points.

:task: Delete all free points:
    Press ((Shift + Del)).

== Tips ==

* You can drag points onto other points to fuse them.

* You can use a [visualizer|/basics/visualizers] to color the original surface to make it easier to distinguish the new surface.

* Change your [shading mode|/basics/view] to __Hidden Line Ghost__ to get a better view of the new surface.

* Hide the [construction plane|/model/aids] to get a better view of the new surface's edges.

@parameters

Number of Edits:
    As you work, the node records the edits you make in these parameters.

Commit Edits:
    Saves the current edits and resets the parameters to start new edits.

Reset All Edits:
    Restores the geometry to its initial state.

@inputs

Mesh Geometry:
    Quad-mesh geometry from a previous operation. If provided, TopoBuild will continue to build upon this mesh geometry.

Template Geometry:
    The source geometry to re-topologize. The points of the quad mesh will snap to the surface of this geometry.
