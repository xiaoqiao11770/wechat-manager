"""Promotes or demotes attributes from one geometry level to another."""

This provides a straightforward way to convert an attribute
from one class to another. For example, a point attribute can be
converted to a primitive attribute, using any one of a number of
different merge methods.

For index attributes, the merge methods treat the attribute as a string.
Average will perform median, sum will perform concatenation, and the other
numeric methods will just resort to __First Match__.

For attributes with multiple components (such as vector), each merge is
done on each component independently.


@parameters
    Original Name:
        This is the name of the attribute in the source class. Eg: `Cd`
	will pick color.  This can also be a pattern or space separated list of
	attributes, such as `*` or `Cd pscale`.
    Original Class:
        This is the class which the attribute starts in. It can be one
        of point, primitive, detail, or vertex.
    New Class:
        This is the class to which the attribute should be promoted. It
        must be different than __Original Class__ or a warning is raised and
        nothing is done.
    Promotion Method:
        Whenever there is more than one attribute in the original class
        which matches a single entity in the new class, some method must
        be used to determine the new value. For example, if converting
        from point attribute to primitive attribute, there will be many
        points corresponding to a single polygon.

        Maximum:
            Picks the largest match.
        Minimum:
            Picks the smallest match.
        Average:
            The mean, or the sum of all matches divided by the number of
            matches.
        Mode:
            The most common match. If there is more than one most
            common, it will be the minimum of the most common.
        Median:
            The middle of the matches. If there is an even number of
            elements, it is the higher of the two possible middles.
        Sum:
            All of the matches added together.
        Sum of Squares:
            All of the matches squared, and then added together.
        Root Mean Square:
            The square root of the average of the squares of all the
            matches.
        First Match:
            The first valid match. For promoting points to primitives,
            this would be the point of the first vertex in the
            primitive.
        Last Match:
            The last valid match. For promoting points to primitives,
            this would be the point of the last vertex in the
            primitive.
    Change New Name:
        If not set, the new attribute name will match the original
        name.
    New Name:
        The new name for the attribute if __Change New Name__ is set.
	If the source is a pattern, this new name should be a pattern that can
	expand to the same length.  Glob-style renaming is done, so if the
	matching pattern is `instance*` and the new name is `my*instance`, then
	the attribute `instancepoint` would be promoted into `mypointinstance`.
    Delete Original:
        If set, the original attribute is deleted after promotion. Note that in some cases, such as promoting a vertex attribute to a point attribute of the same name, the original attribute will always be deleted. To avoid this, rename the attribute when promoting.
