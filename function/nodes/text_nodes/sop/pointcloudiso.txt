= Point Cloud Iso =

"""Constructs an iso surface from its input points."""

You can use this node to "surface" a point cloud, such as
you would obtain from a laser scanner.

@parameters

Step Size:
    The step size to use when polygonizing the Iso Surface.

Radius Scale:
    Controls the range of influence that each input point has on the
    constructed Iso Surface. Increasing or decreasing this
    parameter may eliminate unwanted cracks or bulges in the final
    surface.

Build Polygon Soup:
    When this option is enabled, a polygon soup primitive will be created
    instead of separate polygon primitives.

@inputs

Point Source:
    The set of points to interpolate. The points must have point
    normals defined, which are assumed to be pointing outwards.
