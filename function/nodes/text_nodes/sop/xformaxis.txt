= Transform Axis =

"""Transforms the input geometry relative to a specific axis."""

This is useful to derive an animatable channel to transform an
object about a single axis.


@parameters
Group:
    Subset of geometry to transform.
Group Type:
    The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
Origin:
    #channels: /orig

    The pivot to do the transform with.
Direction:
    #channels: /dir

    The orientation of the axis to transform with.
Translate:
    #channels: /trans

    Amount of translation along the axis.
Rotate:
    #channels: /rot

    Amount of rotation about the axis.
Scale:
    #channels: /scale

    Non-uniform scaling along the axis.
Recompute Point Normals:
    Recomputes point normals if they exist.
    
Recompute Affected Normals:
    Recomputes any normals that are affected by polygons that use both transformed and untransformed points. When transforming the full geometry or full connected components, the results should be the same as when this option is off, i.e. the normals will just be transformed and not recomputed. This does nothing if `P` is not being transformed.
Preserve Normal Length:
    Normal lengths remain unaffected.
Invert Transformation:
    Use the inverse of the transformation. This is the
    transformation which undoes the specified transformation. Two
    transform SOPs with all parameters but this equal will cancel
    out each other's transformation.
@locals
    CEX, CEY, CEZ:
        The centroid of the input
    GCX, GCY, GCZ:
        The centroid of the input group
    XMIN, XMAX:
        The X extents of the bounding box of the input
    YMIN, YMAX:
        The Y extents of the bounding box of the input
    ZMIN, ZMAX:
        The Z extents of the bounding box of the input
    SIZEX, SIZEY, SIZEZ:
        The size of the bounding box of the input
