"""Sharpens edges by uniquing their points and recomputing point
normals."""

This operator does not unique the two end points of the path to
cusp. Therefore, this operator requires at least two connected edges
to have any effect on the geometry. If you only select two edges,
the node uniques the point that is shared between them, and the cusp
fades into the other two points. This provides for the ability to
tailor the cusp by choosing the edges along which the cusp will
fade.

@parameters

Group:
    The edges with which to create a cusp.

    Normally you will use this operator in the viewer and simply
    select the edges you want, however if you need to you can also
    use a space-separated list of the following codes in this field
    to specify edges:

    [Include:edgespec]

Update Point Normals:
    #channels: /updatenorms

    Recomputes the point normals (if they exist).
