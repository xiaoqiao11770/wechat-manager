= Primitive Split =

"""Takes a primitive attribute and splits any points whose primitives
differ by more than a specified tolerance at that attribute."""

For each point in the input geometry, Primitive Split tests the
specified attribute to see if it is within a specified tolerance on each
primitive sharing that point. For each group of vertices outside the
tolerance, a new point will be created.

This operation is useful for splitting the topology of a polygon mesh
for tristripping or other operations.


@parameters
    Group:
        The point group to act on.
    Attribute:
        The name of the primitive attribute to perform the test on.
    Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol

        The maximum error in any dimension of the attribute before it
        will be split.
