= Vertex =

"""Manually adds or edits attributes on vertices (rather than on points)."""

This node is similar to the [Point SOP|Node:sop/point].
It supports two inputs, and will
inherit the first input source by default.

There are currently four vertex attributes supported: Diffuse Color,
Alpha, Texture Coordinates, and Normal.

When the attribute is defined, it can only occur on either points or
vertices, but not both. Thus, if the input geometry has a point
attribute for diffuse color, the attribute will automatically be
"elevated" to be a vertex attribute (if diffuse colors are added in the
Vertex op).

The op processes every vertex of every primitive. For each vertex
processed, there are variables which allow you to know the:

a) Vertex number of the primitive being processed b) The number of
vertices in the primitive being processed c) The point which is
referenced by the vertex d) The primitive which contains the vertex e)
The total number of points f) The total number of primitives

Set the "Cusp Normal" parameter in order for a cusp operation similar
to that of the [Facet SOP|Node:sop/facet], without uniquing shared points,
to be applied based on the Angle parameter as threshold.  This can also
be done with the [Normal node|Node:sop/normal].

There are also local variables to find out the value of the point
attribute position. See Locals section below.

    Example of manipulation:

    {{{
    vertex/cr = $BBX
    vertex/cg = $CG2
    vertex/cb = $CB - $CB2
    }}}
