"""Creates an axis-aligned bounding box or sphere for the input geometry."""

You can use the bounding box with the [Lattice node|Node:sop/lattice]
to create a deformation cage for the input geometry.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to bound.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
    Keep Original:
        Keep the input geometry.
    Create When Bounds Empty:
	If there is no input geometry or the specified group is empty,
	a zero sized bounding box will be created at the origin.  Turning
	this off will cause an empty geometry to be created instead.

    == Box tab ==

        Overview:
            When this tab is selected, it will compute the bounding box.
        Divisions:
            #channels: /divsx /divsy /divsz

            Number of divisions along xyz axes.
        Enforcement Bars:
            Places diagonal crossbars in the divisions of the box.
	Oriented Bounding Box:
	    Orients the bound box to the axes of the input geometry instead of
	    the world axes.

	    NOTE:
	        This option only works on primitives with vertex hulls, such as polygons or meshes.

    == Sphere tab ==

        Overview:
            When this tab is selected, it will compute the bounding
            sphere.
        Orientation:
            Poles of sphere align with orientation axis.
        Accurate Bounds:
            Use a more accurate (but slower) bounding sphere
            calculation.

    Lower, Upper Padding:
	The computed bounding box or sphere is enlarged by these
	padding values.  Note that in the case of spheres, non-uniform
	padding values will not guarantee the resulting sphere still
	contains the input geometry.
