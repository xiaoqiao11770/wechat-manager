"""Polygonizes metaball geometry."""

This node converts the surface of a metaball into polygons.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of primitives to convert.
    
Accurate Normals:
    Evaluate normals from the metaballs.
    
Adjust Bounding Box:
    With this option turned on, the bounding box will be aligned so
    that the slicing planes will not change unless the divisions
    also change.
    
Style:
    The style of conversion to be performed.
    
Uniform Step Size Style:
    This option will create slice planes at equally spaced steps.
    
Uniform Divisions Style:
    This option will divide the bounding box into a fixed number of
    divisions.
    
Level Of Detail Style:
    This option is roughly equivalent to the method found in the
    convert SOP. Clustering of metaballs will attempt to partition
    the metaballs into exclusive sets of metaballs and process each
    set individually. This means that each set will have a different
    apparent level of detail.
    
Cross Sections Style:
    This option will generate cross sectional polygons. The number
    of cross sections determines how many cross sections will be
    built along the axis specified. The maximum depth determines the
    accuracy of the cross sections.
    
Build Polygon Soup:
    Instead of creating separate polygon primitives, will create a polygon soup primitive.
