= PolyLoft =

"""Creates new polygons using existing points."""

This node generates meshes of triangles by connecting (i.e.
lofting/stitching) the points of open or closed faces without adding any
new points. Polyloft can also connect groups of unrelated points in a
similar fashion. The faces and the point groups need not have the same
number of points.

The optional input specifies the rest geometry, typically the copy of
the main input at a specific face (usually 1). This forces the point
order to remain constant throughout the animation and prevents the
triangular stitch from popping as the geometry deforms. If you specify
face or point groups for lofting using rest geometry, make sure they are
defined in the second input.


@parameters
    Connect Closest Ends:
        Start stitching at the two closest points, and handle arbitrary
        face orientation and start vertices
    Consolidate Points:
        Fuse neighboring points before stitching
    Distance:
        #channels: /dist

        Threshold distance for consolidation
    Minimize:
        Distance minimization goal:

        2-Point Distance:
            Default stitching target
        3-Point Distance:
            May help avoid intersections
    U Wrap:
        Close the stitch in U (close each cross-section)
    V Wrap:
        Connect first and last cross-sections
    Create Polygon Group:
        Place the generated triangles into a group
    Collinearity Tolerance:
        #channels: /coltol

        The tolerance for the collinearity check. This check prevents
        the building of a triangle using three collinear points.

    == Faces ==

        Overview:
            Stitch a set of faces by connecting their control vertices
        Group:
            Subset of faces to loft
        Keep Primitives:
            Preserve the cross-sections after stitching

    == Points ==

        Overview:
            Stitch up to 6 sets of points, each set acting as a
            cross-section
        Group 0-5:
            Point group
