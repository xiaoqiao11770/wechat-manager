"""Pushes geometry out from the center to create an exploded view."""

This operation pushes selected geometry out from the center.  It does so
piece-by-piece to create an exploded view of the geometry.  This can be
very useful in visualizing how fractured geometry was broken up.

@parameters

Group:
     The geometry to push outwards.
     
Scale:
     The amount to expand the pieces.  Each piece is moved proportionally to
     its distance to the center.  A value of 1 will approximately
     double the size of the object.  To undo an outwards scale of 1, an
     inwards scale of -0.5 can be used.

Override Center:
     The center to push pieces out from is normally computed as the center
     of the bounding box of the input.  This parameter lets you override
     that choice.

Piece Type:
     Controls how pieces to expand are detected.  Auto-detect tries to use
     some heuristics to detect.  It will first test if the group mask
     matches any primitive groups.  If it does, it will use the group mask.
     It then tests to see if the piece attribute is present as a primitive
     attribute.  If it is, that is used.  Finally, it will perform its own
     connectivity calculation on primitives into a piece attribute and push
     out with that.

Group Mask:
     Groups matching this mask are treated as individual pieces.

Piece Attribute:
     Primitives with identical values of this attribute, as determined by
     the tolerance, become individual pieces.

Tolerance:
     The difference in piece attribute values before they are considered
     separate pieces.
