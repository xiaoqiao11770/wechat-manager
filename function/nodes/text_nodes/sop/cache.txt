"""Records and caches its input geometry for faster playback."""

Use this when [cook|/basics/cooking] times for a chain of ops is long
and you need quicker playback, at the expense of using more memory.

Once cached, the geometries can be accessed in any order. This is
better than a 2D flipbook or scene render since the geometry is
still three dimensional. It is also ideal for pop networks since once
it's cached you can play it forward or backward.

This lets you scrub otherwise sluggish animations in real time,
play pop networks backwards, etc. because the animation is
precomputed and stored in memory.

You can automate invalidation of the cache by connecting a node to the second
reference input of this SOP.  Any modification of parameters in the reference
input chain will clear the cache, however updates to the parameters due to time changes
will not. The first and second inputs can be connected to the same or different nodes.

NOTE:
    This node can also be used a sliding cache around the current frame
    by putting expressions such as `$F-3` and `$F+3` in the `Start/End`
    parameters.  A sliding cache can greatly accelerate calculations that
    involve multiple time-shifting nodes, such as calculating point velocities with a
    [Trail SOP|Node:sop/trail] from geometry interpolated by a [TimeBlend SOP|Node:sop/timeblend].

@parameters

Cache Any Frame:
    #id: anyframe

    When enabled, there is no frame range limitation or granularity limitation on which frames will be cached.
    Instead, there is just a __Max Frames to Cache__ parameter.

Max Frames to Cache:
    #id: maxframes

    When __Cache Any Frame__ is enabled, this indicates the maximum number of different frames of geometry to keep cached.
    Lower this to reduce the risk of running out of memory.
    Raise it if more frames need to stay cached.

Clear Cache when Change Upstream:
    #id: clear on change

    When enabled, if a parameter or connection is explicitly changed upstream,
    i.e. excluding changes that are just due to time changing, the cache is cleared.
    If the second input is used, this parameter is ignored, and the cache will
    always be cleared when that input has such an upstream change.

Start/End/Inc:
    #channels: /range

    A range of values at which to set the the index and param name
    when caching.
Index:
    #channels: /index

    Set to each value within the range for each geometry cached.
Index Param Name:
    #channels: /param

    A stampable parameter set to the index during caching.
Set Frame to Index When Caching:
    #channels: /indextime

    Set the local time to the index for each geometry cached.
Load:
    #channels: /loadmethod

    The loading behavior.
Reload All Cache:
    #channels: /reload

    Clear the cache and reload everything.
Clear Cache:
    #channels: /clear

    Delete all the stored cache.
Cache Points Only:
    #channels: /cachepoints

    Store a single topology for the first cached geometry and only
    point data for the remaining geometries.
Blend Position:
    #channels: /blendpos

    Interpolate points between geometries.
    
    To use this option, replace the __Index__ with the floating point
    frame number `$FF`.
    
    To check that you are blending subframe, use the playbar options to
    turn off integer frame values, and scrub the playbar slowly between
    frames.
