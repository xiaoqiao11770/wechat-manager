"""Merges geometry from its inputs."""

This node merges together the geometry from its inputs
into a single stream of geometry, which you can then send through other nodes.
If you need to continue distinguishing different parts
of the merged geometry later, try using the [Group node|Node:sop/group]
to put the input geometries into groups before merging them.

You can merge together a maximum of 9999 inputs.

NOTE:
    Bypassing this node causes it to only export the first input. It will not compute the merged objects.
