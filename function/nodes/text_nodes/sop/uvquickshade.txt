= UV Quick Shade =

"""Applies an image file as a textured shader to a surface."""

UV Quick Shade is a convenience operator that lets you very quickly put
an image file on a surface without worrying about creating a shader or
adding UVs. If the input surface(s) do not have UVs, this node adds them
using an orthographic projection.

You can append other nodes that replace or modify the UVs created by
this node.

@parameters
    Group:
        Which primitives in the input geometry to apply the texture map
        to.

    Texture Map:
        The image file to use as a texture map.

    Projection Axis:
        The axis to project UV coordinates along. The node uses this
        axis to do an orthographic projection if the input surfaces do
        not already have UVs.

    Texture Scale:
        The scale to apply to the texture coordinates. This is not used
        if the surfaces already have UV coordinates.
