"""Composites vertex, point, primitive, and/or
detail attributes between two or more selections."""

The attributes may be explicitly specified in the corresponding
attribute text field. Exclusion is specified by preceding an attribute
name with the caret character (^). All available attributes can be
specified by leaving the field blank or entering an asterisk (*) in the
field. If the first attribute is preceded by a caret then all attributes
are assumed to be transferred except where explicitly excluded. In all
other cases, no attributes are assumed except where explicitly
included.

The specified attributes of the ordered inputs are composited in
sequence. The attributes are first scaled by the corresponding blending
weights and then composited using the specified compositing operator.
The available operators include Mean, Max, Min, Over, and Under. The
Mean operator determines the weighted average of the input attributes.
The Max and Min operators determine the maximum and the minimum of the
weighted input attributes respectively. For the Mean, Max, and Min
operators, the specified Alpha Attribute affords a per-point,
per-primitive, or per-vertex weight distribution. The Over and Under
operators perform two of the standard alpha blending operations where
the alpha values are taken from the specified Alpha Attribute. The Over
operator scales the incoming weighted input attribute by its alpha value
and adds it to the current intermediate output attribute scaled by one
minus that alpha value:

`source * alpha + destination * (1 - alpha)`

The Under operator is performed in a similar manner but with the alpha
weights swapped:

`source * (1 - alpha) + destination * alpha`

If the Alpha Attribute does not exist for a particular input, then the
alpha mask for that input is assumed to be 1.

@parameters
    Selection Index:
        #channels: /selectionidx

        Specifies which input to use when generating the cooked
        selection.
    Detail:
        Detail attributes to composite.
    Primitives:
        Primitive attributes to composite.
    Points:
        Point attributes to composite.
    Vertices:
        Vertex attributes to composite.
    Match P Attribute:
        If enabled, patterns used in the __Points__ parameter can match the `P`
        attribute.
    Blend #:
        #channels: /blend0 /blend1 /blend2 /...

        Controls contribution of geometry inputs.
    Alpha Attribute:
        Attribute containing the alpha mask.
    Compositing Operation:
        Operator to composite with.
