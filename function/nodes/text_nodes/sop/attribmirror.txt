"""Copies and flips attributes from one side of a plane to
another."""

A correspondence is established between the geometry on the source side
of the model (the side in which the arrow is on) and the closest
mirrored geometry on the destination side.

The closeness of geometry is defined by position. A primitive's position
is computed as the center of its bounding box. Vertex attributes are
mirrored by first finding a mirror primitive, then finding a mirror
point within that primitive. The result is that vertex attributes can be
mirrored perfectly in a symmetric model.

The mirror plane itself is considered to be on the destination side of
the mirror. To correspond two geometry elements, one must be on the
source side and the other must be on the destination side.

== Example ==

    Use the texturing tools to texture one side of a symmetric model
    (such as a human-like character) and then use AttribMirror to
    automatically mirror the UV texture coordinates to the opposite side
    of the model.


@parameters
    Group:
        A subset of the geometry to use as a source or destination for
        the mirror.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
    Use Group As:
        As a source, the elements of the group are mirrored onto the
        rest of the geometry across the mirror plane. As a destination,
        the elements of the rest of the geometry are mirrored onto the
        elements of the group across the mirror plane.
    Attribute:
        Attribute to mirror. "Color" and "Texture UV" are provided for
        convenience. Other attributes can be specified by name by
        selecting "Other Attribute".
    Attribute Names:
        When "Other Attribute" is selected, these are the names of the
        attributes to mirror. The names are separated with a space
        character. Each of the attributes must exist on the geometry
        elements specified by the Group Type parameter.
    Tolerance:
        Create a correspondence between mirrored geometry only if the
        mirrored distance lies within this tolerance.
    Origin:
        #channels: /origin{xyz}

        The origin of the reflection plane.
    Distance:
        #channels: /dist

        Distance to move the reflection plane.
    Direction:
        #channels: /dir{xyz}

        Direction of the reflection plane's normal.
    Attribute Mirror:
        Often one wishes to transform the attribute itself instead of
        just copying it over. This will only take effect for floating
        point attributes.

        No Mirroring:
            The attribute is copied with no change.
        UV Mirroring:
            The attribute is mirrored using the specified UV mirror
            line. This is useful for texture attributes.
        Vector Mirroring:
            The attribute is mirrored using the mirror plane. The
            translational component is ignored. This is useful for
            mirroring Normal attributes.
        Point Mirroring:
            The attribute is mirrored using the mirror plane. This will
            include the translational components, and is most useful for
            attributes such as rest position.
