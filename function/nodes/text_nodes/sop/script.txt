= Script =

"""Runs scripts when cooked."""

This operation runs a list of scripts whenever it is cooked.  This
allows you to tie scripts to be performed at certain points in the
cooking process.  A Script SOP inside a For Each could be used to run
a script for every group on an object, for example.

Unlike the Unix SOP, the script is a Python or Hscript and does not
modify the actual geometry.  

This SOP passes through its input untouched.  Adding a Script SOP does
not increase memory usage.

@parameters
    Make Time Dependent:
        If this flag is turned on, the Script SOP will become
	timedependent even if its input isn't time dependent.  This is
	a way to make a script that is executed on frame change.

    Script:
	Either a Python or an Hscript script that is run whenever this
	SOP would be cooked.
