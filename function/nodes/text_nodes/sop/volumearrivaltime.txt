= Volume Arrival Time =

"""Computes a speed-defined travel time from source points to voxels."""

The Volume Arrival Time SOP computes how long it takes to get to every voxel in
the volume.  This time is measured from a provided set of start points.  The
time taking to cross each voxel is a function of the incoming speed field.

You can take the gradient of the resulting field to get an estimate
for the most efficient way to get to one of the seed points.

@parameters
    Speed Field:
        The volume to use for the speed field.  0 areas will inhibit
	travel from the source points, 1 areas will allow for fast travel.
    Arrival Field Name:
	A new field of this name is created to store the resulting arrival time
	at every voxel.  It is the same resolution as the speed field.
    Normalize Times:
	The times are all scaled between the smallest and largest found
	time.
    Time Cutoff:
	Any times greater than this at the end of the solve are just replaced
	by the maximum time that is not greater.  This avoids unsolved areas
	from getting very large values that can lead to computation problems.
	Setting this greater than 1e10 and turning off the normalize times will
	result in the raw output of the solver.
    Convergence Tolerance:
	How accurate the resulting arrival times have to be before the
	iteration is stopped.
    Maximum Iterations:
	Even if a solution within the tolerance is not found, the process
	will still be stopped if this number of passes has been done.
