"""Extrudes geometry along a normal."""

TIP:
    For extruding polygon faces, use [Poly Extrude|Node:sop/polyextrude]
    instead.

You can use this node for:

* Extruding and beveling Text and other geometry.

* Cusping the beveled edges to get sharp edges.

* Making primitives thicker or thinner.

Extrude by default uses the normal of the surface to determine the
direction of extrusion. In the case of planar or open polygons, the
normal is difficult to determine, and may not always provide the result
that you expect. Turn on the _Primitive Normals_ display in the Viewport
display options to see the normals.

You can also extrude along an arbitrary vector, or along the face
normal. You can specify the number of divisions in the extrusion.

NOTE:
    If you want to extrude a line, use the [Poly Extrude SOP|Node:sop/polyextrude].

== Mouse and Keys ==

((LMB)) |
    Drag to move the selected extrusion to a new location.
((Alt + LMB)) |
    Moves the extrusion in direction of the height vector.
((RMB)) |
    Finish the extrusion.
        
== Extrude Menu ==

Front Face Toggle ((F)):
    Toggles the creation of the extrusion's front face.
Back Face Toggle ((B)):
    Toggles the creation of the extrusion's back face or cap.
Side Mesh Toggle ((I)):
    Toggles the creation of the extrusion's side meshes.
Finish Extruding ((Enter)):
    Completes the extrusion of the geometry.

== Tips ==

* This op can be used for generating two offsetting curves where
  the distance between the two curves remains constant. To do
  this, make sure that you set _Side Mesh_ to _No Output_, the
  first thickness to zero and adjust the second to increase or
  decrease the distance of the offset.

* If your geometry contains normals that are pointed in many
  directions (say after reading geometry from a [File
  SOP|Node:sop/file], or if you have a lot of open or non-planar
  polygons), you can fix it so that they are suitable for
  extrusion.

  Do this by appending a [Group SOP|Node:sop/group] to the SOP
  that contains your geometry, enable Normal, and reduce the
  Spread Angle to something less than 180Â° degrees (e.g. 90). Then
  append a [Primitive SOP|Node:sop/primitive], which should work
  on the group made in the [Group SOP|Node:sop/group]. In the
  Face/Hull page, set the Vertex menu to Reverse.

  Now the normals in your geometry will all be oriented in the
  roughly the same direction, and ready for extrusion. To narrow
  the tolerance, decrease the Spread Angle further.

TIP:
    If you press ((Alt)) and drag the primitive by its normal, each
    primitive in the selection will be extruded along its normal.

NOTE:
    You can also extrude points and edges by enabling them in the
    selection mask before choosing this operator. Extruded points create
    open polygons. Extruded edges create meshes or closed polygons.

@parameters
Source Group:
    The primitives to extrude.
X-Section Group:
    The primitives to use as the cross section.

== Values ==

Point Fusion:
    #id: doFuse

    Consolidates points of polygons that would otherwise
    overlap.

    All points:
        Guarantees no overlapping points.
    Minimal:
        Provides more uniform control with overlapping only in
        extreme cases.
    Individual Faces:
        Implemented only for backward compatibility.
        
Front Face:
    Type of geometry to create for front face.
    
Back Face:
    Type of geometry to create for back face.
    
Side Mesh:
    Type of geometry to create for sides with polygonal
    cross-sections.
    
Initialize Extrusion:
    Attempts to fit the cross section to the source.
    
Thickness Offset:
    #id: thickxlate

    Controls the tangential offset of the cross section
    profile.
    
Thickness Scale:
    #id: thickscale

    Controls the x scale of the cross section profile.
    
Depth Offset:
    #id: depthxlate

    Moves the entire extrusion forward or backward along the
    extrusion.
    
Depth Scale:
    #id: depthscale

    Controls the y scale of the cross section profile.
    
Vertex:
    #id: vertex

    Translates the cross section such that the vertex specified
    is at the cross section origin.
    
Cusp Sides:
    Whether sides are to be smooth-shaded or faceted.

Side Cusp Angle:
    #id: cuspangle

    Threshold angle for edge faceting.

Consolidate Faces:
    #id: shareFaces

    Consolidates the points of the face to the points of the
    sides.

Remove Shared Sides:
    #id: removeSharedSides

    Prevents the creation of duplicate sides.

Hole Polygons:
    #id: dohole

    If polygons overlap in a plane the inner polygons will be
    stamped out of the outer polygons in a fashion similar to
    the hole sop. This allows you to extrude letters like O
    properly.

    The problem with Hole Polygons is that it may incorrectly
    merge polygons that just happen to overlap. If one had
    shards of glass flying through space, it may happen that two
    shards overlap on one frame and will be incorrectly holed.
    Not only does this cut out the shape of one piece of glass
    from the other (an undesired effect), but it also will
    change the primitive count. To avoid this problem, turn off
    Hole Polygons.

== Groups ==

Create Output Groups:
    Generates 3 groups. One for front, back and sides.

Front Group:
    Name of the front group.

Back Group:
    Name of the back group.

Side Group:
    Name of the side group.

@inputs

Source Input:
    Input the op containing the curves that you want to extrude. The
    input can be polygons, Bezier curves, NURBS curves, or any
    combination of the three types.

Cross-Section Input:
    The op on this input will be used to define a cross-section. If
    not specified, a straight line is used to extrude the object.
    This cross-section should be an open Bezier, NURBS, or polygon
    drawn in the XY Plane.
