"""Aligns a group of primitives to each other or to an auxiliary input."""

== Left and Right Primitives ==

The notions of "left" and "right" which follow depend on context. If
an auxiliary input is used, it is always the right primitive and the
primary input geometry are all left primitives. If only one input is
used, then for each pair being aligned, there is a left and a right
primitive. This means that relative to neighboring primitives, one
primitive can be both left and right.

@inputs

Align Source:
    Any geometry type. Treated as left/right primitive pairs or left
    primitives if an auxiliary source is used.

Auxiliary Source:
    Any geometry type consisting of a single primitive treated as
    the "right" primitive.


@parameters

Group:
    Which primitives to align. If blank aligns entire input.
Align To:
    Which primitive to align to. If blank aligns to first primitive
    in the auxiliary input.
Align:
    Can optionally align subgroups of N primitives or patterns of
    primitives.
N:
    #id: inc

    Determines the pattern of primitives aligned.

== Align ==

Overview:
    This tab describes the main parameters for alignment.
Bias:
    #id: bias

    Determines which primitive remains unaffected. 0 : first 1 :
    last.
Left UV:
    #id: leftuv

    Pivot location on the "left" primitive.
Right UV:
    #id: rightuv

    Pivot location on the "right" primitive.
Right UV End:
    #id: rightuvend

    If an auxiliary input is used, this location specifies an
    endpoint for the alignment. Primitives are distributed
    uniformly between the Right UV and the Right UV End.
Individual Alignment:
    Causes each primitive in the group to be aligned. If off,
    only the first primitive is aligned and all others are
    placed relative to it.
Translate:
    Translates primitives during alignment.
Rotate:
    Rotates primitives during alignment.

== Transform ==

Overview:
    This tab describes the post-alignment transformation in the
    local alignment space.
Transform Order:
    Order in which transformations occur.
Rotate Order:
    Order in which rotations occur.
Translate:
    #id: t

    Amount of translation along local xyz axes.
Rotate:
    #id: r

    Amount of rotation about local xyz axes.
Scale:
    #id: s

    Non-uniform scaling along local xyz axes.
Pivot:
    #id: p

    Local pivot point for transformations.
