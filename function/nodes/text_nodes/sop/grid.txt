"""Creates planar geometry."""

The plane can be a
mesh, Bezier and NURBS surfaces, or multiple lines using open polygons.

@parameters

Primitive Type:
    Type of Geometry to create. In the case of Points, no geometry is
    created. Instead, free floating points are created in the same
    positions as they would be in a surface.

Connectivity:
    Applies to Polygons and Meshes only.

    Rows:
        Creates horizontal lines, which are open polygons.
        
    Columns:
        Creates vertical lines, which are open polygons.
        
    Rows & Cols:
        Both Rows and Columns. All polygons are open.
        
    Triangles:
        Build the grid with Triangles.
        
    Quads:
        Default grid connection is four-sided quadrilaterals.
        
    Alternating Triangles:
        Build the grid with alternating triangles. Each four sided quadrilateral is divided in half making two back to back triangles, with the dividing lines alternating in direction.
        
    Reverse Triangles:
        Build the grid with reverse triangles. Each four sided quadrilateral is divided in half making two back to back triangles, with the dividing lines all facing the same direction. 
    
Orientation:
    Orientation plane of grid.
    
Size:
    Width and Height of the grid.
    
Center:
    #id: t

    Position of the center of the grid.
    
Rows:
    #id: rows
    
    Number of rows in the grid or hull.

Columns:
    #id: cols

    Number of columns in the grid or hull.
    
U Order:
    #id: orderu

    The order of NURBS or Bezier surface in the U direction.
    
V Order:
    #id: orderv

    The order of NURBS or Bezier surface in the V direction.

End-point interpolate in U:
    #id: interpu
    
    Extends the surface to touch the end points in the U
    direction.

End-point interpolate in V:
    #id: interpv
    
    Extends the surface to touch the end points in the V
    direction.
