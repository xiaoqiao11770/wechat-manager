= Output =

"""Marks the output of a sub-network."""

This SOP passes through each input to the corresponding output untouched.
When inside a subnetwork, its inputs become the corresponding outputs
of that subnetwork.

[Object Merge SOPs|Node:sop/object_merge] that target the containing object will refer to this node, not to the display/render sop.  SOP Solvers will likewise use the Output SOP
as their target regardless of the display flag.  This can make it easier
to debug a network without changing its behavior.

If there is none, the display/render flags will be used instead.

Each output node can specify which output it wires to.  Output index
0 corresponds to the first wire out of the node, and is also the
value the parent node will use when object merged or middle clicked.

Duplicate output indices will result in errors when cooked.
