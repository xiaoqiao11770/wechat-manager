= Wire Blend =

"""Morphs between curve shapes while maintaining curve length."""

Wire Blend computes a 3D metamorphosis between curves with the same
topology. It can blend between its inputs using average weights of each
input's respective channel. The input geometry is expected to only
contain open faces.


@parameters
    Group:
        Primitives in the first input to be blended.
        
    Differencing:
        Exaggerates blends between objects where values above 1 or less
        than 0 will result in over-scaled shapes.
        
    Blends:
        #channels: /blend0 /blend1 /blend2 /...

        Controls contribution of geometry inputs.
