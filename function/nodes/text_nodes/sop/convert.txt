== Face to Surface Conversion ==

When converting from a set of polygons to a mesh, a single mesh
will result only if:

* more than one polygon is in the input, and

* each polygon has exactly four points, and

* the polygons are arranged as _n_ rows by _n_ columns

* the polygons share coincident points (see [Facet
  OP|Node:sop/facet])

Otherwise, each polygon is converted individually into a mesh.
In fact, any individual face can be converted to any surface.
This is accomplished by cutting the face into three or four
adjacent sections, and then creating a patch from them.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of primitives to convert.
    
From Type:
    Which geometry types will be converted.
    
Convert To:
    What the geometry will be converted to.
    
Connectivity:
    Method of surface construction.

== Level of Detail ==

    Overview:
        Use a floating point level of detail to determine conversion
        resolution. A value of 1 will divide once per voxel. 
         
    U:
        #id: lodu

        Point density in U direction.

    V:
        #id: lodv

        Point density in V direction.
    Trim-Curve:
        #id: lodtrim

        Point density for the trim curves.

== Divisions ==

    Overview:
        Exact number of points to be computed within each span.
    U:
        #id: divu

        Point count in U direction.
    V:
        #id: divv

        Point count in V direction.
    Trim-Curve:
        #id: divtrim

        Point count for the trim curves.

U Order:
    #id: orderu

    Spline order of curves & surfaces in U.
V Order:
    #id: orderv

    Spline order of curves & surfaces in V.
    
Paste Coordinates:
    Evaluate base or feature surface for position.
    
Paste Attributes:
    Evaluate base or feature surface for attributes.
    
Preserve Original:
    Retains original geometry along with converted geometry.
    
Interpolate Through Hulls:
    Splines will preserve the shape of the geometry they are
    converted from. Otherwise, points in the geometry are used
    as points in the hull.
    
Volume Offset:
    When converting volumes to polygons, this is the value of the
    isosurface that will be extracted.  0 works for Signed
    Distance Fields.  0.5 might work better for a fog volume.

Note: For faster conversion of volumes, consider using the specialized [Node:sop/convertvolume].
