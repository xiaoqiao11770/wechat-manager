"""Generates point emission sources for debris from separating fractured rigid body objects."""

This SOP scatters points along interior edges and surfaces of fractured rigid body objects to represent debris emission sources.  Only points near regions where the fractured rigid body objects have recently separated are included in the output.  The `Cd` attribute is used to visualize how long the output debris source will remain.

@parameters

== Debris ==

Reset Simulation:
    Resets the simulation.

Group:
    The primitive group from which to scatter potential debris sources.

Edge Debris:
    Number of potential debris sources to scatter along edges.

Surface Debris:
    Number of potential debris sources to scatter on surfaces.

Search Radius:
    Radius of search for nearby points for detecting separating objects.

Search Points:
    Number of nearby points to consider for detecting separating objects.

Rest Frame:
    Frame used when initializing the state of each debris emission point.

Life Span:
    The length of time each debris source will remain active after nearby separating objects has been detected.

== Visualize ==

Age:
    Color for visualizing the age of each debris source.
