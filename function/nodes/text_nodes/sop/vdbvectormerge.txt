= VDB Vector Merge =

"""Merges three scalar VDB into one vector VDB."""

[Include:volume_types]

Each of the input VDBs must have the same resolution and transform.

TIP:
    To reverse the merge (split a vector VDB into three scalar VDBs), use [VDB Vector Split node|Node:sop/vdbvectorsplit].

@parameters

See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

X Group:
    The name of the VDB primitive to become the first (X) value in the generated vector VDB.
    
Y Group:
    The name of the VDB primitive to become the second (Y) value in the generated vector VDB.
    
Z Group:
    The name of the VDB primitive to become the third (X) value in the generated vector VDB.
    
Use Basename of X VDB:
    Uses the base name of the __X Group__ as the name for the new VDB primitive.
    For example, if __X Group__ is `Cd.x`, the generated vector VDB will be named `Cd`.
    
    If you turn this option off or there is no `name` attribute on the X primitive, the node uses the __Merged VDB name__ parameter.
    
Merged VDB Name:
    If __Use basename of X VDB__ is off or the __X Group__ primitive doesn't have a `name` attribute, use this as the name for the generated vector VDB.
    If you use `#` (the number sign character) in the name it will be replaced with a number (starting at `1`) to distinguish merged primitives when you specify more than one VDB.

[Include:primitive#vdbvectortype]

Remove Source VDBs:
    Removes the merged scalar VDBs from the output.

Copy Inactive Values:
    If enabled, merge the values of both active and inactive voxels.
    If disabled, merge the values of active voxels only, treating
    inactive voxels as active background voxels wherever
    corresponding input voxels have different active states.
