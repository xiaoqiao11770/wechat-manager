= UV Fuse =

"""Merges UVs."""

UV Fuse can fuse UV attributes based on their proximity to each other,
and can position the fused UVs using a variety of methods. The effects
of the UV Fuse operation are most visible when using the UV viewport.

One possible use for UV Fuse is to re-connect UV attributes along
boundaries that were torn apart by the
[UV Unwrap node|Node:sop/uvunwrap].

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry with UV attributes to fuse.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.

    == Distance ==

        Positioning Method:
            How to set fused UV attributes.

            Average:
                Assign an average UV coordinate to groups of fused UV
                attributes.
            First in Group:
                Assign the first UV coordinate to all other fused UV
                attributes.
        Distance:
            #channels: /dist

            Threshold distance for consolidation.
        Metric:
            Measure of distance to use when fusing UV attributes.

    == Manual ==
    
        Sets all UV attributes to a specific value.

        Texture Coordinate:
            Value to assign to UV attributes when Manual is
            selected.

    == Grid ==

        Snaps all UV attributes to a grid.
    
        Grid Type:
            #channels: /gridtype

            How to specify the grid size.
        Grid Spacing:
            The number of units between each grid line/gridspacing
        Grid Lines:
            #channels: /gridlines

            The number of grid lines every unit
        Grid Power 2:
            #channels: /gridpow2

            The same as gridlines, but a power of two is specified. This
            means a value of 7 means 128, and 9 means 512.
        Grid Offset:
            #channels: /gridoffset

            A number from 0 to 1 which specifies what offset the grid
            should have from (0,0,0).
        Grid Rounding:
            #channels: /gridround

            Which way points should snap to the grid.
        Grid Tolerance:
            #channels: /gridtol

            Maximum distance to move points to grid.
