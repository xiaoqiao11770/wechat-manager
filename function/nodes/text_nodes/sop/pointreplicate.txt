"""Generates a cloud of points around the input points."""

The Point Replicate SOP creates clouds of points around the input points.
Each initial cloud of points is generated in local space centered at zero
and aligned along the z-axis, then transformed by the input point attributes
according to the standard [copying and instancing|/copy] rules.

Performance is the main advantage of using this node to replicate large
numbers of unique point clouds versus the [Copy|Node:sop/copy] SOP.

TIP:
	The random placement of particles uses the `id` attribute on the input
	particles as a seed if present, and the [Noise| #noise] functions use the
	`rest` attribute to generated noise in rest position space if present.  
	These two attributes make it possible to replicate stable noisy point
	clouds on top of particle simulations.

@parameters

Group:
	The input point group to replicate.

Keep Input Geometry:
	Do not delete the original input points.

== Quantity == (quantity)

Points Per Point:
	The number of points to generate per input point.  This value can be 
	further modified by an input point attribute if 
	__Generate From Attribute__ is enabled.

Generate From Attribute:
	Use an attribute value on the input points for the probability of 
	generating points from each input point.

Attribute:
	The name of the attribute value to use as a probability of generating
	points if __Generate From Attribute__ is enabled.

== Shape == (shape)

Shape:
	The shape of the generated point cloud before transformation to each 
	input point.

	The File and SOP shape options will read a custom shape from a file 
	or external SOP, respectively, and create a `shapeptnum` attribute that
	holds which point in the File or SOP was used for each replicated point.

Orientation:
	The spatial orientation in local space for 2-D and 1-D shapes.

Center:
	The local center of the point cloud.  For example, increasing the 
	center __Z__ parameter moves the cloud further along the alignment 
	vector from the input point (usually the `N` or `v` attributes.)

Size:
	The local size of the point cloud.

Uniform Scale:
	A uniform factor applied to the replicated point cloud scale, in addition
	to any scaling attributes on the input points.

Velocity Stretch:
	Apply an additional scale along the local Z-axis according to the speed
	of the input point, effectively stretching the replicated point cloud
	along the alignment vector.

	None:
		Do not stretch by velocity.
	Scaled:
		Apply on top of any existing scale factors from the input points.
	Ignore Geometry Scale:
		Ignore any scaling from the input points and use only the 
		__Velocity Scale__.  This setting is useful if you want to ignore
		any variations in the `pscale` attribute of the input points when
		scaling by velocity.

Velocity Scale:
	A scale applied to the input point speed before stretching by velocity.

Seed:
	The seed used to generate random particle clouds.

Quasi-Stratified Sampling:
	Use stratified sampling for a better spatial distribution of points
	within the random clouds, at a slight performance penalty.

== Noise == (noise)

Add Noise:
	Add noise to the replicated point cloud in local space.  The noise
	will respect the input point's `rest` attribute if present.

Noise Type:
	Specifies the noise type.

Frequency:
	The scale of the noise. Decreasing frequency increases feature size.

Offset:
	Allows the noise field to be effectively moved through space.

Amplitude:
	The amplitude of the noise.

Roughness:
	The amplitude reduction of higher frequency noise contributions.

Attenuation:
	Raises the noise to the given exponent.

Turbulence:
	The number of noise generations to use.

== Attributes ==

Copy Source Attributes:
	Copy attribute values from the input points to the replicated points.

Attributes:
	The list of attributes to copy to the replicated points.

Inherit Velocity:
	The amount of velocity for the replicated points to inherit from the 
	input points.

Radial Velocity:
	The amount of radial velocity to add to the replicated points based on
	their transformed positions away from the source input point.

Keep Source Attributes:
	Keep the internally created `sourcept` and `sourceidx` for each replicated
	point.  The `sourcept` attribute holds the point number for the source
	input point; `sourceidx` contains the index of the replicated point
	within its individual point cloud.

Create Output Group:
	Add all replicated points to a point group.

Output Group:
	The name of the group to hold all replicated points if
	__Create Output Group__ is enabled.
