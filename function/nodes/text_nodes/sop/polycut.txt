"""Breaks curves where an attribute crosses a threshold."""

This node allows you to break curves by deleting points, deleting edges, or
splitting edges where an attribute crosses a threshold.

@parameters
    Polygon Group:
        The group of polygons to operate on.

    Type:
        Specifies whether the curve should be broken by manipulating __Points__
        or __Edges__.

    Cut Points:
        The group of points that may be removed or cut when __Type__ is
        __Points__.

    Cut Edges:
        The group of edges that may be removed or cut when __Type__ is
        __Edges__.

    Strategy:
        Specifies how the curve will be broken when an invalid edge is found.
        Invalid edges are determined using the __Cut Attribute__, __Cut
        Value__, and __Cut Threshold__ values. If the __Cut Attribute__ is not
        specified, all edges are considered invalid.
        
        The __Cut Points__ and __Cut Edges__ groups allow you to limit which
        points or edges are affected.

        Remove:
            When __Type__ is __Points__ and an invalid edge is found, both
            endpoints of the edge are deleted (along with the adjacent edges).
            
            When __Type__ is __Edges__ and an invalid edge is found, the edge
            is deleted.

        Cut:
            When __Type__ is __Points__ and an invalid edge is found, the
            curve is cut at the two endpoints of the edge.
            
            When __Type__ is __Edges__ and an invalid edge is found, the
            polygon is cut partway along that edge (the cut location is
            determined using the __Detect Edge Changes__ setting).

    Detect Edge Changes:
        Specifies how invalid edges are found.

        Cut At Attribute Crossing:
            If the __Cut Attribute__ crosses the __Cut Value__, the edge will
            be removed or cut.
            
            If the edge is being cut, the location of the cut along the edge is
            determined by linearly interpolating to find where the __Cut
            Attribute__ crosses the __Cut Value__.

        Cut At Attribute Change:
            If the __Cut Attribute__ changes by more than the __Cut
            Threshold__, the edge will be removed or cut.

            If the edge is being cut, the edge will be divided into multiple
            shorter edges where the __Cut Attribute__ changes by no more than
            the __Cut Threshold__.

    Cut Attribute:
        The attribute used to determine whether edges are valid or should be
        cut.

    Cut Value:
        A threshold value for the __Cut Attribute__. This is used when __Detect
        Edge Changes__ is __Cut At Attribute Crossing__.

    Cut Threshold:
        The maximum amount that the __Cut Attribute__ may change by from one
        point to the next. If the __Cut Attribute__ is a vector, the length
        between the two vectors will be computed. This is used when __Detect
        Edge Changes__ is __Cut At Attribute Crossing__.

    Keep Polygons Closed:
        Toggles whether or not the resulting fragments of a polygon will be
        closed if the original polygon is closed.
