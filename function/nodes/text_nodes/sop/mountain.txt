"""Displaces points along their normals based on fractal noise."""

It is also possible to color points based on their displacement amount.

NOTE:
    This operator uses  [normal attributes|/model/attributes]  on the
    input geometry. If a normal has 0 length, this operator will not
    displace the point along that normal.

@parameters

Point Group:
    The point group to which to apply displacement.

Number of Threads:
    Number of processors to use in computation.

Edit VEX Function:
    Invoke editor on VEX source code.

Re-load VEX Functions:
    Re-load the VEX function to pick up changes.
    
Fractal Depth:
    Number of iterations of fractal brownian motion noise.

Roughness:
    Fractal roughness.

Height:
    Displacement amount of the height.

Frequency:
    Noise frequency.
    
Offset:
    Noise offset.

Noise Type:
    Perlin Noise:
        Standard noise which performs a 3 dimensional hermite spline interpolation on a lattice of random values.
    
    Sparse Convolution:
        Scatters points randomly through space and interpolates their values.

    Alligator Noise:
        A variation of sparse convolution which gives higher frequency discontinuities.
    
Color Points:
    Whether to color points using a built-in ramp. Turning this option on colors points.

Color Offset:
    The offset into the color ramp, which is based on displacement amount.

Color Scale:
    The scale on the displacement amount when looking into the color ramp.
