"""Copies information from a volume onto the point attributes of
another piece of geometry, with optional remapping."""

@parameters

Group:
    The points in the first input that will have their attributes
    set from the volume values.

Volume:
    The volumes in the second input to use for sampling the
    attribute values.  If there are not enough volumes for the
    size of the attribute, the volumes will be re-used in turn.

    For convenience, volumes may be specified directly by "name",
    ie, the value of their name attribute.  Thus the density
    volume can be retrieved with "density" and the velocity set of
    three volumes with `vel.*`.

== Attribute ==

These parameters control what attribute the node saves the volume
information into. They also control what type of attribute the node
creates. If the attribute already exists in the first input, the
node ignores the creation parameters.

Attribute Name:
    Name of the attribute.

Local Variable:
    The name scripts/expressions can use to refer to the attribute as
    a local variable. If you leave this blank, Houdini will use the
    name of the attribute in all caps.

Attribute Type:
    The sort of attribute to create.  
    The __Vector__ attribute is distinct from a triple of floats because it is often transformed like a normal.

Attribute Size:
    The number of components in the attribute type. For example,
    setting __Attribute type__ to "Float" and __Attribute size__ to
    `1` creates a simple scalar float attribute.
    
Default:
    The default value of the attribute. Four text fields are always
    visible but the node only uses the number of fields corresponding
    to the __Attribute size__. If the size is greater than `4`, the
    node cycles back through the four fields.

== Mapping ==

Instead of directly copying the value from the volume, you can
optionally map the to get the volume values into a different range
and/or scale the values using ramps.

Input Range:
    The volume value will be remapped so that this min/max
    pair become the 0..1 interval prior to applying any of the
    ramps.

Map Volume to Value:
    Specifies a ramp to apply to all channels equally.  Out of
    range values will either be clamped or wrapped according
    to the mode.

Map Volume to Vector:
    Specifies a color ramp.  Each channel of the color ramp
    is applied to each volume in turn, so if there are three
    volumes, the first will get the red, the second green, and
    third blue ramps.  However, since volumes are reused, this
    means that if you have a single volume you can color it
    using the vector ramp.

Output Range:
    The ramps output a 0..1 interval.  This is then remapped
    to the min/max given in the output range.
