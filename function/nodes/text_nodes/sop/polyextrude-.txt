[Include:/shelf/polyextrude#includeme]

@locals

PR:
    Primitive number.
    
    For example you can use `fit01(rand($PR), 0.2, 0.6)` in the __Translate Z__ field to create random extrusion heights for each input polygon face.

@parameters

Group:
    Geometry to extrude.

== Local ==

Transformation Order:
    #channels: /lrst

    Order in which to apply local transformation.
Rotation Order:
    #channels: /lxyz

    Order in which to apply local rotations.
Translation:
    #channels: /ltx /lty /ltz

    Local xyz translation.
Rotate:
    #channels: /lrx /lry /lrz

    Local xyz rotation.
Scale:
    #channels: /lsx /lsy /lsz

    Local xyz scale.
Inset:
    #channels: /inset

    Amount by which to inset the face, on edges this parameter
    is treated as an addition to x scale.
Symmetry Axis:
    Sets the local axis of the first face that is used to mirror
    the extrusion.
Keep Points Shared:

    No:
        Extrudes shared points individually.
    Use Normals:
        Extrudes shared points together. Uses the face normals
        to determine the location of the point extrusion.
    Average Positions:
        Extrudes shared points together. Places the extrusion at
        the average location of the points had they been
        extruded separately.

== Global ==

Transformation Order:
    #channels: /grst

    Order in which to apply global transformation.
Rotation Order:
    #channels: /gxyz

    Order in which to apply global rotations.
Translation:
    #channels: /gtx /gty /gtz

    Global xyz translation.
Rotate:
    #channels: /grx /gry /grz

    Global xyz rotation.
Scale:
    #channels: /gsx /gsy /gsz

    Global xyz scale.
Shear:
    Global shearing. The three values represent shearing in the
    X direction on the XY plane, in the X direction on the XZ
    plane, and in the Y direction on the YZ plane, respectively.

== Options ==

Divisions:
    Number of divisions along the side of extrusion./divs
Output Front:
    Toggle whether or not to output a front face, ignored for
    edges.
Output Back:
    Toggle whether or not to output a back face, ignored for
    edges.
Output Side:
    Toggle whether or not to output side faces.
Remove Zero Area Sides:
    When on, sides that are degenerate are removed. Such sides
    can result from an extrusion that scales but does not
    translate.
Remove Shared Sides:
    When on, extruded sides that lie one on another are removed.
    Such sides can result from global extrusion of adjacent
    faces.
Orient Edge Extrusions:
    When on, faces extruded from edges are oriented to match
    neighboring faces.
Consolidate Points:

    None:
        No points are consolidated.
    Per-Face:
        Points created by each face are consolidated.
    All:
        All new points are consolidated.
    All Per-Point:
        The extruded points maintain their consolidation (that
        is to say, they are consolidated if they were
        consolidated, and remain unique if they were unique.)
        This option is preferable to "All" since consolidation
        doesn't require extra computation. When "Keep Points
        Shared" is not used, this option behaves exactly as
        "All".
Tolerance:
    Tolerance used when consolidating points and determining
    which are shared faces.

== Group ==

Output Groups:
    When on, primitives groups are exported.
Front Group:
    Name of group in which to place front faces.
Back Group:
    Name of group in which to place back faces.
Side Group:
    Name of group in which to place side faces.
Preserve Groups:
    If this checkbox is turned on, any extruded polygon will be in the same primitive groups as its corresponding input polygon.  
        NOTE:
                An exception is if the front, back, or side group has the same name as an input group, and an input polygon to be extruded is in that group. Only extruded polygons that are on the front, back, or side (according to which group it is) will be added to the group.
