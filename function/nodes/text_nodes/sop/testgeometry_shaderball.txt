= Test Geometry: Shader Ball =

"""Creates a shader ball, which can be used to test shaders."""

Test geometry provides some built in geometry to prototype and experiment with.

The shader ball provides a standardized method to test shaders.

@parameters
    Split by Seam:
	Splits the shader ball into two separate pieces with a seam running
	between them.  This is useful if you have edge-aware shaders and
	want to ensure they handle boundaries properly.

    Add Screws:
	Add screws to the shader ball; allowing testing of how your shader
	interacts with reflective surfaces.

	NOTE:
	    The screws are purely ornamental and are not required for the
	    structural integrity of the shader ball.

    Shell Material:
	The material to apply to the shell of the shader ball.  If not set, the
	material assigned to the object as a whole is used.

    Use Material On Pedestal:
	The base of the shader ball can use a different material than the
	shell.  This is useful for investigating the interaction of two
	shaders.

    Pedestal Material:
	The specific material to use for the pedestal.  By default this uses
	an internal brushed metal material.

    Translate:
        Position of the center.
        
    Uniform Scale:
        Uniform scaling.
