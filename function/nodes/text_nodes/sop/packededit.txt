@parameters

== Visibility Operations ==

This tab allows you to control the visibility of primitives.  The primitives affected by the operation can be specified by a group, or alternatively, by the `path` attribute associated with the packed primitive.

Group:
        The group of primitives affected by the operation.
Packed Names:
        The names of primitives as specified by the `path` attribute.
Display As:
        The viewport LOD for the specified packed primitives.
3D Viewport:
        Controls the visibility of primitives in the 3D viewport.  This is similar to the behavior of the [Visibility SOP|Node:sop/visibility].  This operation can be applied to non-packed primitives as well as packed primitives.

== Material Operations ==

This tab provides a simplified version of the [Material SOP|Node:sop/material] to allow simple primitive material assignments.

Group:
        The group of primitives affected by the operation.
Packed Names:
        The names of primitives as specified by the "path" attribute.
Material:
        The material to assign to the primitive.  This operation can be applied to non-packed primitives as well as packed primitives.

== Lighting Operations ==

When rendering packed primitives in mantra, it is possible to set the `lightcategories` property for the packed primitive. This tab provides an interface to set lighting controls on individual packed primitives.

Group:
        The group of primitives affected by the operation.
Packed Names:
        The names of primitives as specified by the `path` attribute.
Light Selection:
        The value for the `lightcategories` property.
