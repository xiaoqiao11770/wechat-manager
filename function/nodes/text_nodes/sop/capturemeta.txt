"""Captures points on geometry to metaballs,
similarly to capturing to a bone."""

By itself, this operator does not affect the geometry. The metaballs are
not output.

Connect the skin geometry to the first input, and input the paths to the
metaball SOPs in the Metaball SOPs parameter. The metaballs must be in
[primitive groups|/model/groups] . To interactively perform a
capture, use the [Capture Geometry|/shelf/capturegeometry] tool
at the OBJ level.

Captured points will have a `metaCapture` point attribute containing the
name of the metaball group that captured the point, and the group's
weighting.

The density of the metaball where it captured the skin geometry at the
capture frame controls how much influence the metaball has when it
deforms the skin geometry.

You can edit the influence of the metaballs on the skin per-group by
using the [Capture Layer Paint SOP|/shelf/paintcapturelayer]
    - [/shelf/capturegeometry]

@parameters
    Metaball SOPs:
        Paths to the SOPs containing the metaballs. These are typically paths
	to Muscle SOPs which create a series of metaballs representing a
	muscle.
    Capture Frame:
	Frame number at which to compute the capture weighting. This
	frame will cook slower than other frames due to the
	weighting computation.
    Destroy Existing Weights:
	Destroy any existing capture weights.
    Blend Factor:
	If destroy existing weights is off, then this parameter
	determines the blend factor of the created capture weights
	with the existing ones.
    Visualize Capture:
	Whether to visualize the capture weights by coloring the
	geometry.
    Visualize Type:
	Whether to visualize weights as a single weight, or as multiple colors
	for all capture regions.
    Visualize Mode:
	For the single primitive visualize type, this specifies how to map the
	weights to a color.
    Zero Weight Point Color:
	For the multiple primitives visualize type, this specifies the color
	used for points with zero weights.
    Force Recapture:
	Forces the node to recook.
