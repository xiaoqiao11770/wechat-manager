"""Captures low-res simulated cloth."""

High resolution geometry that is used to render cloth usually isn't suitable for
direct cloth simulation. It is recommended that you use cleaner, lower-res version of your cloth for the simulation and then transfer the motion to the hi-res geometry. The Cloth Capture and [Cloth Deform|Node:sop/clothdeform] tools allow you to do this. 

The Cloth Capture tool assigns weights to the points in the hi-res geometry. These weights determine the influence of each lo-res point on each hi-res point. The [Cloth Deform|Node:sop/clothdeform] tool transfers the simulated movement of the lo-res geometry to the hi-res geometry using the weights that were generated by the Cloth Capture tool.

The Cloth Capture/Deform tools can be seen as a single deform tool spread out over two SOPS. They were designed as two separate SOPs because the Cloth Capture tool allows you to manually modify the weights. 

The following image shows the lo-res geometry (underneath) transferring the deformation to the hi-res geometry (on top).

@parameters

Group:
    Optional point group to assign capture weights. If empty, this
    implies that all points should be assigned.

Kernel Function:
    [Dropoff function|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]
    used to convert the distance of a point to a capture
    primitive weight. This function is normalized according to
    each primitive's capture parameters.

Radius:
    The radius of the capsule that determines how the low res points influence the high res points. If the radius is too small, some points may not be captured. However, if the radius is too large, the simulation will be slow because each high res point will be influenced by too many low res points and you will lose details of the movement.

Visualize Weighting:
    If on, this will generate point color attributes reflecting the wire capture weights.

Visualize Mode:
    This specifies the gradient used for visualization.

    Infra-red:
        Utilizes the entire color spectrum where they range from blue (0) to red (1).
    White to Red:
        Provides a gradient which varies from white (0) to red
        (1).
    Grayscale:
        Provides a gradient which ranges from black (0) to white
        (1).
    Black Body:
        Ranges from black (0) to red, yellow, then white (1).

Zero Weight Point Color:
    This specifies the color used for points which are not
    affected by any capture primitives when using the Multiple
    Primitive visualize type.
