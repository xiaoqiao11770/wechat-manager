"""Creates polygon or NURBS lines from a position, direction, and distance."""

@parameters

Primitive Type:
    Type of Geometry to create.

    In the case of Points, no geometry is created. Instead, free
    floating points are created in the same order as if the geometry
    had been made.

Origin:
    #id: orig[xyz]

    The start of the line

Direction:
    #id: dir[xyz]

    The direction of the line

Length:
    #id: dist

    The length of the line

Points:
    #id: points

    How many points to make the line with

Order:
    #id: order

    The order of the NURBs or Bezier curve
