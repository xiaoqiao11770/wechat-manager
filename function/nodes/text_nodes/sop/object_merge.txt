= Object Merge =

"""Merges geometry from multiple sources and allows you to define the manner in which they are grouped together and transformed."""

@parameters

Number of Objects:
    The number of object merge parameters available.
    
Enable Merge n:
    Controls whether the node uses this line. This can be useful if
    you only want to temporarily disable a merge instead of removing
    it completely.
    
Object n:
    A path to geometry to merge. Click the button at the end of the
    text box to choose a node, or type a path manually.

    TIP:
        You can use `__display_sop__` or `__render_sop__` in the path
        instead of the name of a real surface node name to have Houdini
        use whatever node has the display flag or render flag.
    
    See the [surface node help|/nodes/sop] for an explanation of
    display and render flags.

    * Choose an object to merge in the object's geometry. For
      example, `obj/model1`.  Houdini uses the SOP with the
      [display flag|/nodes/sop]  for display and the SOP
      with the [render flag|/nodes/sop]  for rendering.

    * Use wildcards to merge in multiple objects. For example,
      `/obj/ball*` would merge in geometry from any objects whose
      names start with `ball`. The wildcards available are the same
      as in the [opglob|Cmd:opglob] command.

    * Use a  [bundle reference|/basics/bundles]  (for example,
      `@props`) to merge in the geometry from all objects in a
      [bundle|/basics/bundles].

    * Choose a SOP node to merge in that node's geometry, even if it
      doesn't have the  [display flag|/nodes/sop].

    * Use a  [dynamics path|/dyno/io]  to merge in geometry
      from a dynamics simulation. For example,
      `/obj/dopnet1:wireobject1/Geometry`.

    * If the path is blank, Houdini doesn't merge in any geometry.

Group n:
    A group of primitives within the object to merge in. Leave this
    blank to merge in the entire object.
    
Expand Group n:
    When __Group n__ is not blank, turn this option on to merge in
    an extra ring of primitives. This is useful for maintaining the
    correct seam when merging in polygon primitives that are to be
    subdivided.

Transform:
    The source geometry can be transformed to account for differences
    between the source object's orientation and a reference
    orientation.  __None__ will prevent any corrective transform from
    being done.  __Into This Object__ will ensure the object has
    difference between the source object and this object's transforms
    applied.  __Into Specified Object__ will use the specified transform
    object rather than this object as the destination space.

Transform Object:
    Merged geometry will be transformed relative to the geometry defined in this field.

    * Leave the field blank to import the geometry into the _current
      object's space_. The geometry will appear at the origin with
      no transformation.

    * Enter `.` to import the geometry using the transforms from the
      _source object_. The geometry will appear in its original
      position and orientation, but with zeroed transforms.

    * Enter the path of another object to import the geometry in the
      context of that object.
      
Invert Transform:
        If you specify a __Transform Object__, the geometry will be transformed from the source object's space into the space of the given object's space. Turning this checkbox on will reverse the transform, so the geometry will be transformed from the space of the given object to the transform of the source object.

Create Point Groups:
    Creates a point group for every object that is merged in. Each
    group name is made unique by appending a number if necessary.
    
Point Group Prefix:
    When generating names for new point groups containing the
    imported geometry, add this prefix. This makes it easier to
    identify the groups created by this merge.
    
Create Primitive Groups:
    Creates a primitive group for every object that is merged in.
    Each group is made unique by appending a number if necessary.
    
Primitive Group Prefix:
    When generating names for new primitive groups containing the
    imported geometry, add this prefix. This makes it easier to
    identify the groups created by this merge.
    
Create Per-Point Path:
    Creates an  [attribute|/model/attributes]  on
    the imported points, containing the full path to the source from
    which the point was merged in. If a point is  [merged from
    DOPs|/dyno/io] , the path is the path to the DOP
    Geometry Data.

Create Per-Primitive Path:
    Creates an  [attribute|/model/attributes] on
    the imported primitives, containing the full path to the source
    from which the primitive was merged in. If a primitive is
    [merged from DOPs|/dyno/io] , the path is the path to
    the DOP Geometry Data.

Path Attribute:
    The name of the per-point or per-primitive attribute created when
    adding primitive paths.

    This defaults to `objname` and can be referenced in later primitive
    expressions using `OBJNAME`.

Pack Geometry Before Copying:
    Pack the input geometry into an Embedded Packed primitive before copying.
    This results in the input geometry being shared by each copy rather than
    being duplicated for each copy.

Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.

Display As:
    The viewport LOD for the specified packed primitives.

Add Path Attribute:
    This option allows you to put the full path of the merged geometry into
    the named string attribute.
