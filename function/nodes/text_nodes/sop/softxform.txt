= Soft Transform =

"""Moves the selected point, with smooth rolloff to surrounding points."""

As you move the select point(s) or group,
the surrounding points (within a set radius) move by
an amount proportional to their distance to the selected point/group.


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of points to transform.
    Transform Order:
        Order in which transformations occur.
    Rotate Order:
        Order in which rotations occur.
    Translate:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Amount of translation along xyz axes.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Amount of rotation about xyz axes.
    Scale:
        #channels: /sx /sy /sz

        Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.
    Shear:
        Amount of shearing. The three values represent X on XY plane, X
        on XZ plane, and Y on YZ plane respectively.
    Pivot:
        #channels: /px /py /pz

        Local pivot point for transformations.
    Soft Radius:
        #channels: /radius

        Area of influence.
    Soft Type:
        Type of rolloff function.
    Tangent Angles:
        #channels: /tandeg

        Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first value
        applies to the tangent farthest from the source point, the
        second applies to the tangent closest to the source point.
    Kernel Function:
        [Metaball kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]  to use when rolloff Type is __Meta-ball__.
        
    Ignore Point Connectivity:
        Affect only points connected to the points in the group, or all points within the radius.
        
    Attributes:
        These point attributes are transformed, if they are marked as transforming.
        Use [Attribute Create|Node:sop/attribcreate] to set the transformation type on an attribute to __Position__, __Vector__, __Normal__, __Quaternion__, or __Transform Matrix__. Set the type to __None__ to make an attribute non-transforming, or
        remove it from this list.
    Recompute Point Normals:
        Recomputes all normals as point normals, if a normal attribute exists.
    Recompute Affected Normals:
        Recomputes any normals that are affected by polygons that use any transformed points.
        This does nothing if `P` is not being transformed.
    Preserve Normal Length:
        Normal lengths remain unaffected.
    Visualize Falloff:
        When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
        attribute.

        Never:
            Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
        Always:
            Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
        When Viewport Tool Is Active:
            Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
            when the viewport tool for this node is active.
    Local Space:
        If true, the manipulation of selected points will take place in 
        a frame defined by the averaged normals of the selected points.
    Up Vector:
        If the soft transform node is operating in local space mode, 
        then the second degree of freedom may be specified via this parameter.
        The local y-axis will be rotated to match the specified up vector as
        closely as possible.
