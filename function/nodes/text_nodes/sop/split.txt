= Split =

"""Splits primitives or points into two streams."""

Split is designed to divide your geometry into two separate streams,
the portion that matches the group and the portion that doesn't.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of the input geometry to send to the first output.

    Group Type:
        The type of entities to split.

        Guess from group:
            Infer which type of entity to split based on the contents
            of the group.
        Points:
            Split points.
        Primitives:
            Split primitives.

    Invert Selection:
	Negates the sense of the selection.  Instead of sending things
	that match on the first output, send things that match
	as the second output.
    
    Delete Unused Groups:
	Remove any groups that are left empty after deleting
	points/primitives.
