"""Deforms a spline surface by reshaping a curve on the surface."""

The CurveClay op is similar to the [Clay SOP|Node:sop/clay] in that you
deform a spline surface not by modifying the CVs but by directly
manipulating the surface. However, instead of using a point on the
surface, you use one or more faces to deform that surface. Also,
CurveClay does not yet support polygonal meshes.

The combination of inputs will determine the modes of transformation.
For any combination of inputs, the following parameters modify the
following behaviors of the op.

The combination of inputs determines the way the op deforms the
surface. There are three valid combination types: 1 input, 2 inputs,
and 3 inputs.

One input |

    When only the surface is specified, it must contain at least one
    profile in order for Curveclay to work. In this case, you must
    specify how the surface should be deformed in the region near
    the profile (whether to deform the profile along a vector \[X,
    Y, Z or User Defined], or along the surface normal). You must
    also specify how far out the surface should be pulled, using the
    Distance parameter.

    When one or more profiles form a closed loop, you have the
    option to displace the inside of the loop, by enabling the
    option Deform Inside of Loop. Another option allows you to form
    a closed loop by using several open profiles. The algorithm is
    the same as the one used in the [Trim SOP|Node:sop/trim] when
    not treating curves individually. This might be useful for
    putting a regular dent into a surface (e.g. A circle, or a
    font).

Two inputs |

    When the surface and a set of deforming faces is specified (the
    deformed faces are the third input) the profiles on the surface
    will be snapped to the deforming faces. This option has no
    additional inputs. This might be useful when you want to snap
    any profile to any free floating curve.

Three inputs |

    When all three inputs are specified, the Rest faces will first
    be projected to the surface. The projection is done in two ways:
    along a specific vector (X, Y, Z, or User Defined) or along the
    Minimum Distance to the surface. Each point on the curve will
    first be projected to the surface. Then this curve will _not_ be
    snapped to the deforming face. Rather, the curve will be
    deformed by the difference between the rest face and the
    deforming face. This option provides flexibility on all inputs.
    For example, this would be ideal for creating random mountain
    ranges.

When using CurveClay on a wrapped surface, here are some points to
remember:

* You may want to use a higher number of divisions, since when going
  across the seam of the wrapped surface, straight line
  approximation would be turned off and more sample points may be
  needed.

* If you're not going across the seam, then the refinement of the
  surface is only local. However, when the deformation area of the
  surface gets near the seam, the refinement is done over the whole
  surface. Do not be alarmed if the whole surface has been refined.

@parameters

Face Group:
    Subset of faces (NURBS,Bezier,polygons) to project, or subset of
    profiles to deform, depending on how many inputs are connected.

    Examples include `0.5 1.2-3.9 5.*`

    This group can even take surfaces (possibly intermixed with
    profile curves) when the 2nd input is not present, indicating
    that all the surface's profiles must be used. Then, the example
    above becomes: 0.5 1.2-3.9 5

Surface Group:
    Subset of spline surfaces to be deformed when all three inputs
    are connected.
    
Divisions on Face:
    #id: divsonface
