= Profile =

"""Extracts or manipulates profile curves."""

You will usually need a [Trim SOP|Node:sop/trim], [Bridge
SOP|Node:sop/bridge], or [Profile SOP|Node:sop/profile] after a [Project
SOP|Node:sop/project]. Use a [Trim SOP|Node:sop/trim] to cut a hole in
the projected surface; use a [Bridge SOP|Node:sop/bridge] to skin the
profile curve to another profile curve.


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of profiles to extract or manipulate.

    == Extract ==

        Overview:
            Extract a stand-alone 3D curve as the world or parametric
            image of the profile. The non-parametric option will yield a
            curve whose shape and position in space are identical or
            very similar to those of the chosen profile. The parametric
            option will produce a planar, XY face whose vertices and
            type will be identical to those of the profile in 2D; also,
            if the profile is a spline it will have the same basis as
            the extracted curve.
        Parametrically to XY:
            Extract the profile's parametric image as a 3D face

            A profile extracted parametrically can be reapplied to the
            surface identically with the Project operation by choosing
            the Parametric option with no Mapping to Range. Use this
            method to extract the profile, pull its points or edit it as
            you would any 3D face, then re-project it on the surface at
            the same location.

        Smooth Curve:
            Fit a spline through the extracted points or don't. This
            option is disabled when extracting the profile
            parametrically. Turn it off to bypass the fitting process
            which might be both expensive and unnecessary when
            extracting profiles produced by boolean operations (see
            Surfsect).

    == Fitting ==

        Divisions Per Span:
            #channels: /sdivs

            Number of 2D points evaluated in each span
        Tolerance:
            #channels: /tolerance

            Precision of 3D fitting algorithm
        Order:
            #channels: /order

            Spline order of resulting spatial curve
        Preserve Sharp Corners:
            Enable or disable fitting of sharp turns in curve
        Keep Surface:
            Keep or remove the owner surface after extraction
        Delete Original Profile:
            Remove the profile from its owner surface

    == Remap ==

        Overview:
            Reposition and scale an existing profile to fit within the
            specified domain range. It is a good means of bringing
            invisible profiles into view by setting the mapping range
            between 0 and 1 in the U and V parametric directions. A
            profile mapped outside the unit domain becomes invisible but
            is not removed from the surface. Other ways to change a
            profile are available through the Primitive operation.
        U Range:
            #channels: /urange1 /urange2

            Area of the unit U domain to be mapped on
        V Range:
            #channels: /vrange1 /vrange2

            Area of the unit V domain to be mapped on
