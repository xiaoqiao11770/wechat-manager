= Volume Splice =

"""Splices overlapping volume primitives together."""

The Volume Splice operation splices overlapping volumes together.  The
volumes have to be axis-aligned with matching voxel sizes.  This sort
of output is common from distributed fluid sims.

The input primitives are grouped together by their name attribute.  A
new volume is created for each group large enough to contain all the
source volumes.  Each voxel of the new volume is copied from at most
one of the source volumes.  If more than one overlaps, the voxel
closest to the center point of the primitive is used.
