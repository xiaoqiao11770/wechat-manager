= Test Geometry: Rubber Toy =

"""Creates a rubber toy, which can be used as test geometry."""

Test geometry provides some built in geometry to prototype and experiment with. Not only does it provide a more interesting starting point than a torus, but it is also more representative of the sort of geometry your effect will have to deal with: multiple components, holes, and not perfect geometry.

Meet Flip!, the official Flip Fluid Floatation device for all testing needs!

This inflatable poolside companion can be towed behind your boat, or if
you are sufficiently dexterous, used as a diving platform!
