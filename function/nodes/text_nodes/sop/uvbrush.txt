    == Operation ==

        Operation:
            The operation used by Apply To All.

            Drag:
                This will drag the points along the brush direction.
            Dilate/Contract:
                This will move points towards or away from the center of
                the brush according to the scale (either FS or BS).
            Smooth:
                This will smooth out the texture coordinates under the
                brush. Boundary points will be preserved.
            Erase Changes:
                This will perform a local undo under the brush.
        Foreground/Background:
            #channels: /fs /bs

            The dilation/contraction factors used for foreground and
            background modes. The left mouse will use the FS scale
            factor and the middle mouse the BS scale factor.
        Apply To All:
            Paints all of the selected geometry.
        Reset All Changes:
            Restores geometry to initial state.
