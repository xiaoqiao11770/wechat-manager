"""Measures volume, area, and perimeter of polygons
and puts the results in attributes."""

The volume of a polygon is the volume of the pyramid defined with the
polygon as the base and the specified point as the apex.  This volume is
signed and can be summed with those of other polygons to get the actual
volume of a 3D object.  This summation can be done with an Attribute
Promote SOP. 

The area of polygons is only exact when they are planar. Otherwise it is
the area of the triangle fan of the polygon from its barycentre.

It can also be used to compute an approximation of the curvature at the
points of the input geometry. The curvature is a measure of the
difference between the point normal and the spread of all the edges a
point shares. A point shared between planar surfaces will have a
curvature of 0.

NOTE:
    Bezier and NURBs curves use the measurements of the polygon which
    shares their control points. Bezier and NURBs patches use the
    measurements of the mesh which shares their control points.

TIP:
    To birth particles based on primitives' areas, use one of the
    following emission types in your source pop: Edges (attribute), Prim
    Center (attribute), and Surfaces (attribute). These use the
    'Distribution Attribute' from each primitive as the probability
    distribution. See the Source POP for more info.

@parameters

Group:
    The group to be measured. This will be a primitive group for
    __Area__ or __Perimeter__ measurements and a point group for
    __Curvature__ measurements.

Type:
    The type of measurement to be performed. It is one of __Area__,
    __Perimeter__, __Curvature__, or __Volume__.
    
	__Volume__ will measure individual polygons volumes. See the note at the	top for details.

Override Name:
    Determines if the default attribute name should be used. The
    default name is `perimeter` for perimeter, `area` for area and
    `curvature` for curvature.

Attribute:
    The name of the attribute to store the generated measurement in,
    if the default is not used.

Min/Max:
    #id: curvemin/curvemax

    The curvature computed will be clamped between the two values
    specified.

Center:
    The point used as the apex of the pyramid when calculating the
    volume of a polygon.  The pyramid is defined with the polygon
    as its base and this point as its apex.
