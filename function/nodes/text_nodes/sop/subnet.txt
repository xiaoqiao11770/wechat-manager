The Subnet op is essentially a way of creating a macro to represent a
collection of ops as a single op in the Network Editor. The Subnet op
can contain an entire op Network within it, stream-lining and
simplifying your op network both visually and conceptually.

Selecting Edit SubNetwork... from the op's pop-up menu presents you
with a new Network Editor with four subnetwork inputs. These four
inputs are connected directly to the four inputs on the Subnet op in
your original network. Proceed by attaching ops as required to these
four subnetwork inputs. The display op will be wired back to the output
connector of the Subnet op in your original op network. To get back to
the original op network, go up a level (type ((U))).

Please refer to [subnetworks|/network/organize]  for a complete
discussion and an example of how to use subnetworks.


TIP:
    Select several Operators that you want to make into a subnetwork,
    and select Collapse Selected from the OP's pop-up menu to
    automatically create a subnetwork out of them. You will see the
    selected Operators replaced by a single Subnetwork op, and it will
    be properly rewired to contain the previously selected ops.
