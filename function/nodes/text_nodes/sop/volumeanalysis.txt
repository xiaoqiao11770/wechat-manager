= Volume Analysis =

"""Computes analytic properties of volumes."""

The Volume Analysis operation computes analytic properties of the volumes, such
as the gradient and curvature. This is done in the local space of the volume. These are a function of more than one voxel so are more difficult to compute inside a [Volume VOP|Node:sop/volumevop]. 

Where possible, these operations occur in place and preserve the name.  If new
volumes have to be created, it is attempted to ensure they gain the `.x`, `.y`, `.z` style suffixes in their name attribute. 

The length is calculated by measuring the slope of increasing values. For example, if temperature rises faster over a shorter distance, it will create a bigger gradient. If temperature is a height field, then gradient length is how steep the hill is.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be analyzed.

    Analysis:
	The types of analysis that will be performed.

	    Curvature:
		Each voxel has its local signed curvature computed and stored
		in the result.

	    Gradient:
		The gradient at each voxel is computed with central differences
		and the result stored in a triple of aligned volumes. 

	    Laplacian:
		The divergence of the gradient is computed for each
		voxel and stored in the result.
