#type: include

== Brush ==

    Shape:
        The basic shape of the brush: circle, square, or bitmap.
    Bitmap:
        What bitmap to use. The alpha channel becomes the brush.
    Radius:
        #channels: /radius

        The radius of the brush when painting in the 3d viewport.
    UV Radius:
        #channels: /uvradius

        The radius of the brush when painting in the 2d viewport.
    Radius Pressure:
        #channels: /radiuspressure

        This controls how much effect the pressure of a stylus will have
        on the radius. A value of 1 means the radius will go from 0 to
        the amount in Radius. A value of 0 will mean the radius will
        always be constant, regardless of pressure. A value of 0.5 will
        mean the radius will be scaled between one half of Radius and
        Radius.
    Depth:
        #channels: /depth

        If set, this limits how far the brush will paint along its axis.
        This can be used if connectivity is disabled to limit the effect
        of the brush. The first parameter is how deep below the surface
        the brush should penetrate. The second is how high above the
        surface it should stop. These values can be negative.
    Brush Angle:
        #channels: /brushangle

        How far to rotate the brush.
    Brush Squash:
        #channels: /squash

        Amount to squash the brush in the y direction before rotation.
    Opacity:
        #channels: /opacity

        The amount to affect the stencil mask.
    Opacity Pressure:
        #channels: /opacitypressure

        This controls the how much effect the pressure of a stylus will
        have on the opacity. It obeys the same scaling as the Radius
        Pressure.
    Brush Splatter:
        #channels: /brushsplatter

        A random noise in the brush's opacity based upon the position
        on the brush.
    Paper Grain:
        #channels: /papergrain

        A random noise on the object's stencil mask based on the object
        position.
    Soft Edge:
        #channels: /softedge

        Percentage of the brush to be rolled off.
    Kernel Function:
        Which metaball kernel to use for the roll off.
    Up Vector Type:
        How the brush should be oriented on the surface:

        Stroke Direction:
            Oriented in the direction in which the brush moves.
        Fixed:
            Oriented as specified in the Up Vector field.
    Up Vector:
        #channels: /upvector

        The fixed up vector to orient brush to.

== Symmetry ==

    Reflective:
        If set, the brush will perform reflective symmetry. Any strokes
        will be mirrored along the plane of symmetry.
    Rotational:
        If set, the brush will perform rotational symmetry. Any strokes
        will be rotated around the axis of symmetry.
    Axis:
        #channels: /symaxisx /symaxisy /symaxisz

        This defines the normal of the plane of symmetry for reflection
        and the axis of symmetry for rotation.
    Origin:
        #channels: /symorigx /symorigy /symorigz

        This defines the origin of the plane of symmetry for reflection
        and the origin of the axis of symmetry for rotation.
    Number of Rotate:
        #channels: /symrot

        This defines the degree of rotational symmetry. A degree of 3
        means the stroke will be applied 3 times at 120 degree
        separation. A value of 5 will perform the stroke 5 times with 72
        degrees of separation.
    Reflection Dist:
        #channels: /symdist

        This is the distance of the plane of symmetry from the origin of
        symmetry.
    UV Reflective:
        If set, the brush will reflect when brushing is done in the UV
        viewport.
    UV Origin:
        #channels: /symuvorig

        The origin of the line of reflection in the UV viewport.
    UV Angle:
        #channels: /symuvangle

        The angle of the line of reflection in the UV viewport. 0 will
        mirror about the U axis, 90 will mirror about the V axis.

== Stroke ==

    Orient Brush To Surface:
        Switches between the brush being perpendicular to the surface
        or always oriented along the view direction. If you are having
        trouble with a shaky brush, try turning this off.
        Turn this off in order to brush on disconnected points,
        (point clouds).
    Use Connectivity:
        If set, the tool will only affect points connected to the
        closest point to the intersection. This is usually a good thing,
        as it avoids accidentally painting through the geometry (but see
        the depth parameter), but can prevent smoothly painting across
        seams.  This should usually be turned off in order to brush
        on disconnected points, (point clouds), since they are not
        connected to each other.
    Realtime Mode:
        Set this to paint geometry as it's deforming.
    Direction:
        The current direction of the brush. If orient to surface is on,
        this is the normal direction of the surface hit by the brush.
        Otherwise, it is the direction from the eye to the surface.
    Hit Location:
        The current location of the brush. This tracks the surface as
        the brush moves along it.
    Hit Primitive:
        The primitive number of the primitive the current brush is
        centered at.
    Hit UV:
        The location the current brush is on the current primitive.
        Note this is a parametric UV location, not the texture UV
        location.
    Hit Pressure:
        The amount of force the brush is currently applying. This is
        only meaningful when a tablet interface that supports pressure
        is used.
    Hit Point:
        The point closest to the current brush's center.
    Event:
        Controls the current state of the brush. When it is on No-op,
        the values of the stroke tab are ignored and no updating of the
        geometry is done. Other values are set automatically as you
        brush the surface, allowing the SOP to update in response to
        your actions.
