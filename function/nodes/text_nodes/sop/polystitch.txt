= PolyStitch =

"""Stitches polygonal surfaces together, attempting to remove cracks."""

First, the boundaries of all the polygons to be stitched are found. An
edge is a boundary edge if it is shared by no other polygon. The
uniqueness of edges is determined by point numbers, and not by spatial
positioning. Each boundary is then split at each "corner" into a number
of pieces. A list of corner points can be manually specified, or any
point at which the boundary changes direction by a certain amount can be
flagged as a corner.

Finally, any two boundary pieces that are within the tolerance of each
other are stitched together. This is performed by snapping the points of
the high detail edge to those of the low detail edge.


@parameters
    Polygons to Stitch:
        The polygons to consider for stitching.
    Corner Points:
        A list of point numbers that are to be considered breaks in the
        boundary edges.
    Max Dist to Stitch:
        #channels: /tol3d

        The maximum distance which two edges can be from each other and
        still be stitched together
    Consolidate Points:
        #channels: /consolidate

        When several points along ONE edge are snapped to the same
        position, consolidate them into a single point.
    Automatically Find Corners:
        #channels: /findcorner

        Whenever an edge changes direction at a point more than the
        specified angle, mark that point as a corner.
    Corner Angle:
        #channels: /angle

        The maximum angle a boundary can change at a point before it
        becomes a corner.
