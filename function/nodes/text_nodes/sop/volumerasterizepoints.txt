= Volume Rasterize Points =

"""Converts a point cloud into a volume."""

The Volume Rasterize Points operation  takes a cloud of points fills
a volume accordingly.

The point attributes, such as `pscale`, `orient`, etc, are incorporated to
transform the generated noise and displacement fields.

The point attributes `padding_absolute` and `padding_relative` will override
the per-point computation region.

NOTE: If all you want is a density based stamping, the Volume Rasterize
Particles will provide a much faster operation.

@parameters
    Destination:
	Which volumes or VDBs in the first input to stamp into.
	If no name attribute is present, there should be a single
	volume or VDB and is treated as the "density" target.

	If more than one is present, a name attribute should be
	present.  The name is used to compare with the point attributes.

	`density` will be filled with the alpha mask of the points.

	`vel` will be filled with the local velocity of the points
	measured both by the `v` attribute and the angular velocity
	in the `w` attribute.

	All of the destination must be aligned and of the same
	time (vdb or volume).

    Rasterization Group:
	A group of points in the second input to rasterize.

    Density Scale:
	A global scale for the evaluated density of the points.

    Scale Texture Space:
	Whether the local texture coordinates for displacement
	and noise will be scaled by the `pscale` attribute.  Scaling
	causes the noise pattern to stretch as the particle grows,
	unscaled means the particle will expand into a fixed
	noise pattern.
	
    == Compositing ==

    Merge Method:
	How to blend each incoming point in with the base grid.
	Because it is not defined what order the points will
	actually be stamped in, this must be symmetric.

    Samples per Voxel:
	If stamping small points a low resolution volume,
	aliasing artifacts can occur.  To avoid this, you can make more than
	one sample per destination voxel.

	If this is 1, no random sampling is done, instead a single sample is
	done in the middle of the voxel.

    Sampling Seed:
	The seed used for generating the random samples.

    Scalar Attrib:
	An extra float point attribute that will be composited
	into a same-named volume, provided both exist.

    Vector Attrib:
	An extra vector point attribute that will be composited
	into a same-named volume, provided both exist.

    Integer Attrib:
	An extra integer point attribute that will be composited
	into a same-named volume, provided both exist.

    == Fall Off ==

    Smooth Falloff:
	The density between the solid core and the outside will fall off linearly if smooth falloff is off.  If on, an Elendt model will be used to provide a smoother derivatives at either extreme.

    Solid Ratio:
	The amount of the particle that gets full density.  0 means only the very center of the particle will have full density.  1 means the entire particle out to the `pscale` will have full density.  Note that such a harsh cut off tends to produce aliasing problems.

    Exterior Pad:
	The particles will be expanded uniformly outwards by this distance.  This is measured in world space and is thus the same regardless of the particle's `pscale`.

    == Displacement ==

    Enable Displacement:
	Turns on displacing of each particle's displacement.

    Amplitude:
	How much to move the surface of the particle.  Note this is in world space, not relative space!  Making this very large can thus result in unexpectedly long cook times.

    Element Size:
	The size in worldspace of the largest noise pattern.
    Element Scale:
	The noise pattern can be stretched anistropically.  The values are in the local texture coordinates of the particle, so will rotate when the particle does.
    Animate Displacement:
	Change the displacement over time.
    Pulse Length:
	Time in seconds for the displacement pattern to fully change.

    == Noise ==

    Enable Noise:
	Turns on applying noise to the density.  This is used to cut out a pattern of holes through the particle's splat pattern.

    Gain:
	A contrast adjustment for how extreme the noise affects the density.
    Bias:
	Controls how much of the density will remain after the noise is applied.
    Element Size:
	The size in worldspace of the largest noise pattern.
    Element Scale:
	The noise pattern can be stretched anistropically.  The values are in the local texture coordinates of the particle, so will rotate when the particle does.
    Animate Noise:
	Change the noise over time.
    Pulse Length:
	Time in seconds for the noise pattern to fully change.
