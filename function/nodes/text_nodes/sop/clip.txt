"""Removes or groups geometry on one side of a plane,
or creases geometry along a plane."""

When __Keep__ is not "All primitives", this operator attempts to clip
all input primitives above or below the plane. If clipping would destroy
the primitive's structure (polygons, particle systems), the primitive is
simply deleted.

You can use this operator as a modeling tool, or to manually clip
polygons outside the field of view to reduce scene complexity.

NOTE:
    The sense of the __Distance__ parameter changed in Houdini 5. You
    may need to negate the value in older hip files.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of the input geometry to clip.
Keep:

    Primitives above the plane:
        Keep the geometry on the positive side of the plane, delete
        geometry on the other side.
    Primitives below the plane:
        Keep the geometry on the negative side of the plane, delete
        geometry on the other side.
    Keep All Primitives:
        Cut new edges into the input geometry along the plane, but
        do not delete geometry.
Origin:
    #channels: /origin{xyz}

    Origin of the clipping plane.
Distance:
    #channels: /dist

    Distance to translate the clipping plane along its normal.
Direction:
    #channels: /dir{xyz}

    Normal vector of the clipping plane.
Create Groups:
    Generates groups for clipped geometry.
Above Plane:
    Name of group above the clipping plane.
Below Plane:
    Name of group below the clipping plane.
Clip Unconnected Points:
    Points that are not part of any primitive will be deleted if they are
    on the wrong side of the clipping plane.
