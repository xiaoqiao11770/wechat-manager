"""Sets an attribute on selected points or primitives to sequential numbers."""

This node sets an attribute on each point or primitive in the selected 
__Group__ sequentially (for example, it would set the attribute on the first 
point in the group to `0`, the second point in the group to `1`, and so on).
This differs from the built-in point/primitive number because this node only
sets the attribute for points/primitives in the selected group.

@parameters

Group:
	The group to set the attribute on.

Group Type:
	Whether the group contains primitives or points.

Attribute:
	The name of the attribute in which to store the index.
