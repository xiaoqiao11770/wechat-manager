= Shrinkwrap =

"""Computes the convex hull of the input geometry and moves its polygons inwards along their normals."""

The Shrinkwrap SOP computes the convex hull of the input points, and shifts the resulting polygons along their normals to shrink or grow the shape.
This algorithm is also used by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] to build convex hull collision shapes.

@parameters
Group:
    The points to use when computing the convex hull.

Shrink Amount:
    After computing the convex hull, each polygon will be shifted inward by this amount. A negative value will expand the convex hull outward.
