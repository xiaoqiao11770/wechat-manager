"""Writes and reads geometry sequences to disk."""

The File Cache SOP combines a File SOP and a Geometry ROP to provide a simple
way to cache out an intermediary stage of a SOP network to a sequence of disk
files.

@parameters

Load from Disk:
    Switches between passing through the input geometry and loading the geometry from disk.
    
    If you start a render, it will always use the input geometry, ignoring this parameter.

File Mode:
    How this node reads/writes the geometry to/from the disk file.

    This parameter is only enabled when __Load From Disk__ is disabled.

    Automatic:
        Writes the file if it doesn't exist, reads it if it does
        exist.
        
        This is useful for caching, where the node will
        write the cache to disk the first time it cooks, and
        use the cache file from then on.
        
        To force a refresh of the cache, manually delete the file
        on disk.
    
    Read Files:
        Reads the geometry from the file. If the node's input
        is connected, it's ignored.
        
    Write Files:
        Writes the input geometry to disk.
        
    No Operation:
        No file access will occur. Pass through the input geometry
        to the output, like a [Null surface node|Node:sop/null].

Geometry File:
    Where to load the geometry from when in __Load from Disk__ mode. This also
    controls where the [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] will save the
    geometry.

Export to File:
    See the [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] help for these parameters.

Substeps:
    Further subdivide the frame increment by this number of substeps, often
    used when caching geometry as input to a substepped simulation.  Note that
    if this parameter is greater than 1, the __Geometry File__ parameter should
    take into account fractional frames via use of `$T` or `$FF` in its expression.

Compression:
    When importing simulation data, you may have extra attributes or groups that you
    do not need to save to disk.  The __Delete Attributes__ and __Delete Groups__ parameters
    will cull this extra data. 

	Point, primitive, vertex, and detail attributes that match will be
	deleted.  However, the point `P` attribute is always kept.  To
	delete all except `P` and velocity (`v`), use the string: `* ^v`.

    If you do not require the full precision of 32 bit float attributes,
    you can down cast them at this point as well.  See the [AttribCast
    SOP|Node:sop/attribcast] help for more information.

Loading:
    When loading the cached file back from disk, this controls the behavior.
    The [File SOP|Node:sop/file] help has more details for these parameters.
