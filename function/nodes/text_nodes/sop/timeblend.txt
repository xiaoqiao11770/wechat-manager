= TimeBlend =

"""Blends intraframe values for geometry."""

The Time Blend SOP will cook its input at both the start and end of the
closest integer frame. The values are then blended according to the
fractional position within the frame.

Optionally, one can also specify that before a start or after an end
frame, the first or last geometry should be held.

The Time Blend SOP can be used to change networks that only exist on
whole frame steps into a network with proper intermediate results. This
will only work if the topology of the geometry stays the same from frame
to frame. It then allows for effects like multi-segment motion blur to
correctly infer in between values. One such use is to turn a file sop
that reads `foo$F.bgeo` into one that is defined smoothly over time.

@parameters
    Hold First Frame:
        Determines if the first frame should be clamped. If so, any
        evaluations before this frame value will instead evaluate at
        this frame value.
    Hold Last Frame:
        Determines if the last frame should be clamped. If so, any
        evaluations after this frame value will instead evaluate at this
        frame value.
    Shortest Path Transform Blending:
        Enables use of spherical linear interpolation to blend primitive
        transforms.
    Point Id Attribute:
	If this attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding points
	in the different blend shapes.  For example, using id will allow
	particle systems to find matching points even if particles are deleted.
	If it does not exist or is blank, point numbers will be used for the
	matching.
    Primitive Id Attribute:
	If this attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding
	primitives in the different blend shapes.  For example, using name
	will allow fluid systems to find matching volumes even if volumes
	are reordered.  If it does not exist or is blank, primitive numbers
	will be used for the matching.
