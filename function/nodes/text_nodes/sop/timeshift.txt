= TimeShift =

"""Cooks the input at a different time."""

The TimeShift SOP will cook its input at a different time than it itself
is cooking on. This allows one to gain access to earlier or later
frames, or to retrieve data always at a specific absolute frame.

Note that the TimeShift SOP doesn't cache the input, so depending on how
the data is accessed, the [Cache node|Node:sop/cache] may be more efficient.


@parameters
    Method:
        Determines if the input should be cooked at a given frame
        number or a given time. Time is measured in seconds.
    Frame:
        The frame number to cook the input on.
    Integer Frame:
        Rounds the given frame number to the nearest integer frame,
        avoiding fractional frame cooking. Note that when shifting by
        time, fractional frames are always allowed.
    Time:
        The time, in seconds, to cook the input on.
    Clamp:
	Optional clamping of the Frame/Time value to retrieve. The choices
	are: None, Clamp to First (uses only the Start value),
	Clamp to Last (uses only the End value),  or Clamp to Both.
    Start/End:
        The frame/time values used to perform clamping.
