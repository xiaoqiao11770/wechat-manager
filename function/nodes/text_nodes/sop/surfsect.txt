= Surfsect =

"""Trims or creates profile curves along the intersection lines
between NURBS or bezier surfaces."""

This op performs boolean operations with NURBS and Bezier surfaces, or
only generates profiles where the surfaces intersect. The individual
surfaces do not need to be solids (i.e. wrap in U and V), nor do they
need to form a solid as a group (for example, you can cut a grid with a
sphere).

The surfaces in the first input are denoted by "A" in the parameter
list. The surfaces in the second input are denoted by "B". The entire A
set is intersected with the B set, which allows for true csg operations
with spline surfaces. Thus, if A forms a solid and B forms a solid, any
boolean operation between A and B will produce a solid. If either set
has an open topology, the result will also be open.

What is deemed to be the inside and outside of a trim region depends on
the direction of the surface normals. If necessary, use the [Primitive
SOP|Node:sop/primitive] to reverse the surface normals by reversing the
surface's U or V direction.


@parameters
    Group A:
        Subset of NURBS and Bezier surfaces
    Group B:
        Subset of NURBS and Bezier surfaces to intersect with A
    3D Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol3d

        World space precision of the intersection
    2D Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol2d

        Domain precision of the intersection
    Marching Steps:
        #channels: /step

        Number of steps for tracing each profile span

    == Boolean ==

        Overview:
            Boolean operations between the surfaces in A and B
        Operation:
            Union, intersect, A - B, B - A, or user-defined:
        Keep Inside A:
            Preserve the inside sections of the A surfaces
        Keep Inside B:
            Preserve the inside sections of the B surfaces
        Keep Outside A:
            Preserve the outside sections of the A surfaces
        Keep Outside B:
            Preserve the outside sections of the B surfaces
        Radius:
            #channels: /radius

            The radius to round the intersection with
        Span Density:
            #channels: /density

            The density to create the rounded fillet.
        Cusp Angle:
            #channels: /angle

            The change in angle which triggers a corner

    == Generate Profiles ==

        Overview:
            Just create profiles where the surfaces intersect
        Target:
            Which surface to output profiles for: A, B, or both
        A Profiles Group:
            Place the A profiles in a user-defined group
        B Profiles Group:
            Place the B profiles in a user-defined group
        Avoid Already Trimmed-Out Parts:
            Intersect only the visible surface parts and truncate the
            intersection profile at the trimmed-in surface boundaries.
        Join Profiles Created By Multiple Surfaces:
            If a surface has several adjacent profiles caused by its
            intersection with two or more surfaces, the profiles will be
            joined into a single curve-on-surface
