"""Divides, deletes, or groups geometry based on an interactively drawn line."""

This node is created by the [Knife shelf tool|/shelf/knife]. You can use it to interactively draw a line to divide, delete, or group geometry.

[Include:/shelf/knife#includeme]

@parameters

Group:
    [Geometry group|/model/groups] or subset of primitives to operate on. When this parameter is blank, the node operates on all input geometry.

Keep:
    All primitives:
        Divides primitives (polygon faces) that intersect the plane.
        
    Primitives below the plane:
        Deletes all geometry on one side of the plane.
        
    Primitives above the plane:
        Deletes all geometry on one side of the plane.

Origin:
    #id: origin

    Origin of the clipping plane.

Distance:
    #id: dist
    
    Distance of clipping plane from the origin. You can use this parameter to move the plane "up" and "down" without using the handle.
    
Create groups:
    When __Keep__ is __All primitives__, puts the two resulting partitions into named groups for later operations.
