"""Imports scalar and vector fields from a DOP simulation."""

The DOP Import Fields SOP is designed to streamline the common
operation of importing many fields from fluid simulations into SOPs.

== Compression ==

When importing simulation data, you may have extra attributes that you do not need to save to disk.  The delete attributes will cull these attributes. 

NOTE:
    Point, primitive, vertex, and detail attributes which match will be deleted.  However, the point `P` attribute is always kept.  So, to delete all except `P` and velocity (`v`), use the string: `* ^v`.

If you do not require the full precision of 32 bit float attributes, you can down cast them at this point as well.  See the [AttribCast SOP|Node:sop/attribcast] help for more information.

After importing the fields, you can apply some compression rules before saving them to disk.  Some fields, such as density, may have different requirements for tolerances than others, such as velocity.  Sp, multiple compression groups can be created here.  Each group can use the `@name=density` style group field to select the desired fields.

Detailed descriptions of these options is found in the [Volume Compress SOP|Node:sop/volumecompress].

@parameters

DOP Network:
    The DOP Network to extract the fields from.
    
DOP Node:
    All the objects created by this node will be imported.  This is the
    equivalent of the [dopobjscreatedby|/expressions/dopobjscreatedby]
    expression.  This overrides the Default object.
    
Default Object:
    If the Object specified in the individual import options is
    blank, this default object is used instead.  This is a DOP
    Object specifier.
    
Transform Geometry With Position Data:
    Finds the Data named Position on the simulation object and
    extracts its translation and rotation information to transform
    the geometry.
    
Transform Geometry With Geometry Data:
    Use the transform embedded in the Geometry data attached to the
    simulation object. This is a transform is usually set when __Use
    Object Transform__ is set on the Geometry Data.
    
Compute Min/Max Values:
    The minimum and maximum value of each volume primitive will be computed
    and stored on a primitive attribute of that name.

Import Simulation Settings:
    Certain global simulation settings, such as the timescale and 
    rest field ratios, can be imported as detail attributes.  This
    allows the resulting .bgeos to be rendered without needing to
    keep track of the settings of the simulation that created them.
    
Presets:
    Quickly populates the field choices to common defaults.  
    
    NOTE:
        This will wipe out any existing imports.

== Import ==

Fields to Import:
    How many fields to import.
    
Import:
    Toggles whether this specific field should be imported.
    
Visualization:
    Controls how the volume will appear in the viewport.
    Ancillary data volumes like velocity and rest fields are often
    useful to mark as invisible so they are available to mantra but
    don't get in the way of viewing.
    
Object:
    The object to retrieve a field from.  If blank, the default
    object is used instead.
    
Field:
    The scalar or vector field to extract from the object.  It
    will be properly named, ie, the vel field will create `vel.x`,
    `vel.y`, and `vel.z` named volumes.  It will also be in a group
    named after the DOP object.

    While this is designed around importing fields, any geometry
    can actually be imported here.  For example, Geometry will
    import the geometry associated with an [RBD object|Node:dop/rbdobject].
