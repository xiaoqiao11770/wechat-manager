"""Animates points using an MDD file."""

This operator allows you to read in an MDD file previously created using the
MDD Point Cache ROP, or another package, and animate the input geometry based
on the point locations specified in the MDD file.

If there is no input geometry, then points with no connectivity will be created
to represent the MDD file.

WARNING:
    Point numbers in the input geometry must match point numbers in the MDD
    file.

@parameters

MDD File:
	The name of the file to be read.
Frame:
	The frame to read from the MDD file. This defaults to `$FF`.

	TIP:
	    To offset the animation to start at a different frame, use the
	    expression `$FF+1-`_start frame_ instead. Note that when exporting
	    such an imported sequence, you should set the starting frame value
	    to be _start frame_ as well in the [Node:out/mdd] render node.

Reload MDD:
	Force a reloading of the file.

Interpolation:
	Type of interpolation to be used for inter-frame evaluation of the
	MDD file.

Coordinate System:
	The coordinate system used in the MDD file. If this is set to
	Right-Handed, z coordinates will be negated upon loading to match
	Houdini's native left-handed coordinate system.

Shift to Frame 1:
	The frame read from the MDD file will be offset such that it will
	begin at frame 1.

@locals

MDD_FSTART, MDD_FEND, MDD_NFRAMES:
    The frame range of the loaded MDD file.

MDD_TSTART, MDD_TEND, MDD_TFRAMES:
    The frame range of the loaded MDD file expressed as times using the scene's
    current $FPS.
