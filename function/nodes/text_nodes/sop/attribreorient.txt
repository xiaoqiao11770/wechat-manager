"""Modifies point attributes based on differences between two models."""

The AttribReorient SOP computes rotations for each point in the
selection by examining differences in surface normals and tangents from
the reference geometry to the live geometry. The named vector and
quaternion attributes are updated by applying the computed rotation to
the attribute values in the reference geometry.

NOTE:
    AttribReorient only operates on polygons. Other geometry type such
    as Bezier and NURBS surfaces can be converted to polygons using a
    Convert operation prior to applying AttribReorient.


@parameters
    Group:
        #channels: /group

        Points whose attributes will be reoriented.
    Vector Attributes:
        #channels: /vattribs

        The vector attributes to reorient.
    Quaternion Attributes:
        #channels: /qattribs

        The quaternion attributes to reorient.

    Use Normal Attribute:
        #channels: /usenormalattrib

        If enabled, the attribute "N" will be used instead of computed
        surface normals.
