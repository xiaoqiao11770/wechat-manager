"""Creates simple geometry for use as control shapes."""

The Control SOP generates simple primitives as selected by the user. It
is primarily used by the [Null OBJ|Node:obj/null] to create control shapes.

The [Control SOP|Node:sop/control] can take in a single input as its
source geometry. It will display the source geometry if the "Custom"
control type is selected.

@inputs

Geometry Source:
    If an input is used, then the source geometry will be displayed
    as long as the "Custom" control type is selected.

@parameters
Color:
    #id: color

    Display color.
    
Scale:
    #id: scale

    Uniform scaling about the xyz axes.
    
Display:
    #id: displayicon

    Whether to display only the icon, only the axis, or both.

    Icon:
        Displays only the icon geometry.
    Axis:
        Displays only the axis.
    Icon and Axis:
        Displays both the icon and axis.
        
Control Type:
    #id: controltype

    Switches between the type of geometry to display.

    Null:
        Displays null geometry (i.e. cross).
    Circles:
        Displays circle primitives.
    Box:
        Displays box primitive.
    Planes:
        Displays plane primitives.
    Null and Circles:
        Displays null and circle primitives.
    Null and Box:
        Displays null and box primitives.
    Null and Planes:
        Displays null and plane primitives.
    Custom:
        If an input source is specified, this option will display
        the geometry of the input.
        
Orientation:
    #id: orientation

    Used in conjunction with circle or plane primitives. Determines
    which circles or planes to display.

    All planes:
        Displays circle or plane primitives on the YZ, ZX and XY
        planes.
    YZ plane:
        Displays a circle or plane primitive on the YZ plane.
    ZX plane:
        Displays a circle or plane primitive on the ZX plane.
    XY plane:
        Displays a circle or plane primitive on the XY plane.
    YZ, ZX planes:
        Displays circle or plane primitives on the YZ and ZX
        planes.
    YZ, XY planes:
        Displays circle or plane primitives on the YZ and XY
        planes.
    ZX, XY planes:
        Displays circle or plane primitives on the ZX and XY
        planes.
        
Shaded Mode:
    #id: shadedmode

    Determines whether to display the primitives as shaded objects
    or as wireframe objects.

    off:
        Displays primitives in wireframe mode.
    on:
        Displays primitives in shaded mode.
