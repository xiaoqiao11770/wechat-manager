= Rest Position =

"""Sets the alignment of solid textures to the geometry so the
texture stays put on the surface as it deforms."""

This node creates an attribute which causes material
textures to stick to surfaces deformed using other operations.

Rest can get the rest position in one of two ways:

- By reading a file.
- By attaching a second input.

The first input is the deforming geometry. The second input (or file) is
the rest position data, which is typically a static, non-deforming
surface.  If no second input or rest file is provided the first input
will be used for the rest values.  This is useful when the rest SOP is
used before deformation in the pipeline.

The topologies of the two geometries should match.

All primitives support the 'rest' attribute, but, in the case of quadric
primitives (circle, tube, sphere and metaball primitives), the rest
position is only translational. This means that rest normals will not
work correctly for these primitive types either.

The 'rest' attribute is exported to RenderMan as the 'Pr' attribute.
This is output for all surfaces as a 'vertex float attribute'.

Rest normals are required if feathering is used on polygons and meshes
in Mantra. NURBs/Beziers will use the rest position to compute the
correct resting normals.
