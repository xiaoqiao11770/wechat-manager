"""Fits a spline curve to points, or a spline surface to a mesh of points."""

Any type of face or surface represents a valid input. The Fit op looks
only at the control vertices (CVs) of the primitives, treating the CVs
as data points to run the fit through. For example, if a cubic NURBS
surface and a mesh have the same number of rows and columns and
identical points, they will yield an identical fit because the Spline
bases of the input NURBS surface are ignored.

The Fit op generates two types of outputs: primitives that roughly
follow the path of the data points without necessarily going through the
data points; and primitives that touch all the data points. The first
type, known as "approximation", is used primarily to extract a lean,
smooth shape from a heavy data set, lending itself well to data
reduction. The second type, known as "interpolation", often serves as a
smoothing tool for paths that must go through specified target
positions.

@parameters

== Fit ==

Method:
    Fitting style: by approximation or by interpolation.

Primitive Type:
    Type of output spline primitive: NURBS or Bezier.

Connectivity:
    Type of surface generated when input is a mesh:

    Rows:
        Creates horizontal lines, which are display curves.
    Column:
        Creates vertical lines, which are display curves.
    Rows & Cols:
        Creates both rows and columns, all display curves.
    Triangles:
        Builds the surface with triangles (not used).
    Quadrilaterals:
        Creates four-sided quadrilaterals.
    Alt. Triangles:
        Creates the surface with alt. triangles (not used).

U Order:
    #id: orderu

    Order of fitted spline in the U direction.

V Order:
    #id: orderv

    Order of fitted spline in the V direction.

== Approximation ==

Tolerance:
    #id: tol

    Primary precision factor in fitting.

Smoothness:
    #id: smooth

    Allows for more or less roundness in the shape.

U Multiple Knots:
    Enables preservation of sharp turns of the data in U.

V Multiple Knots:
    Enables preservation of sharp turns of the data in V.

== Interpolation ==

Scope:
    Establishes the interpolation method:

    Global:
        Yields as many CVs as data points.
    Local:
        Yields more CVs than data points but the fit is tighter.
    Breakpoints:
        Similar to Global, only the basis reflects data
        directly.

U Data Parameter:
    Specifies the data parameterization in the U direction:

    Uniform:
        Uses evenly spaced parameter values.
    Chord Length:
        Parameter values based on relative distances between
        data.
    Centripetal:
        Similar to Chord Length, better suited for sharp
        corners.

V Data Parameter:
    Specifies the data parameterization in the V direction:

    Uniform:
        Uses evenly spaced parameter values.
    Chord Length:
        Parameter values based on relative distances between
        data.
    Centripetal:
        Similar to Chord Length, better suited for sharp
        corners.
U Wrap:
    Optionally close the generated spline in the U direction.

V Wrap:
    Optionally close the generated spline in the V direction.

Fit Corners:
    Enables corner preservation if the scope is Local.
