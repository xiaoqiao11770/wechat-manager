"""Computes surface normal attribute."""

== Overview ==

This node computes point, vertex, primitive, or detail normals using a slower but more accurate approach than the [Facet node|Node:sop/facet]
or the [Vertex node|Node:sop/vertex].

Unlike the [Vertex node|Node:sop/vertex], it supports computing vertex normals for polygon soup primitives
that were created with a [PolySoup node|Node:sop/polysoup] having the __Merge Identical Vertices__ option disabled.  Existing polygon soup
primitives can be passed through a [PolySoup node|Node:sop/polysoup] with __Merge Identical Vertices__ disabled to ensure that vertices are unmerged.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The subset of geometry whose normal attribute, `N`, should be modified.

    This can be a point, vertex, primitive, or edge group.  If necessary, it will be expanded to a point, vertex, or primitive group, depending on the value of __Add Normals to__.
    If the input geometry doesn't have a normal attribute, this group will be ignored and normals will be computed for all relevant geometry elements.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype

    The type of group that __Group__ specifies.

    If __Guess from Group__ is specified and the group type is ambiguous, the guess is made that __Group__ specifies a primitive group.

Add Normals to:
    #id: type

    The type of elements to which to add or modify the normal attribute, `N`.

    Points:
        Normals will be computed for each point.  This will be the average of the vertex normals around the point, weighted by the vertex angle for
        each polygon incident to the points, so that, for example, triangulating the surface won't change the result.

    Vertices:
        Normals will be computed for each vertex.  If normals of vertices around a single point are less than __Cusp Angle__ apart from each other, they will
        be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.

    Primitives:
        Normals will be computed for each primitive.

    Detail:
        A single normal will be computed for the detail, being the average of the primitive normals, weighted by the primitive area.

Cusp Angle:
    #id: cuspangle

    When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will
    be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.
