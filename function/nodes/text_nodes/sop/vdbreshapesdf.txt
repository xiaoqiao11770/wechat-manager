= VDB Reshape SDF =

"""Reshapes signed distance fields in VDB volume primitives."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node changes the shape of an SDF field by moving the SDF surface in or out along its normals.
Unlike just adding an offset to a signed distance field, this node properly updates the "active" voxels to account for the transformation.

@parameters

Group:
    The name of VDB primitive(s) in the input to be reshaped.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.
    
Alpha Mask:
    If enabled, it will use the second input's VDB for alpha masking.
    Assumes voxel values are between 0 to 1 inclusive.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.
    
Operation:
    What sort of reshaping process to apply to the SDF.

    Dilate:
        Expands the surface outwards along its normal.
        
    Erode:
        Shrinks the surface inwards along its normal.
        
    Open:
        First shrink the surface inwards, then expand it outwards by the
        same amount.  This causes isolated hills and islands to be erased.
        
    Close:
        First expand the surface outwards, then shrink it inwards by the
        same amount.  This causes holes and valleys to be filled.

Use World Space for Offset:
    Sets whether the `Offset` amount is specified in Houdini units. When this
    option is off, the amount is interpreted as voxels.

Offset:
    Amount to move the surface in or out. This amount is assumed to be in
    voxels if `Use World Space for Offset` is off.
