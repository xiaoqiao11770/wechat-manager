"""Deforms captured points according to metaball deformations."""

Connect the output of a [Capture Metaball SOP|Node:sop/capturemeta] to
the input of this operator to make Houdini deform the captured skin
geometry as the metaballs deform. This node uses the attributes created
by the Capture Metaball SOP to determine which surfaces are controlled
by which metaball groups.

The density of the metaball where it captured the skin geometry at the
capture frame controls how much influence the metaball has when it
deforms the skin geometry. This density is multiplied by the weight of
the group that metaball is contained in. Group weights are specified by
the [Capture Metaball|Node:sop/capturemeta] and [Capture Layer
Paint|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint] operators.

@parameters

Normalize Group Weights:
    #id: normalize

    Normalize group weights before performing the deformation.

Deform Normals:
    Deforms the point normals to match the deformation of the
    points.

Deform Vector Attributes:
    Deforms the vector attributes to match the deformation of the
    points.

Vector Attributes:
    Vector attributes to deform.

Deform Quaternion Attributes:
    Deforms the quaternion attributes to match the deformation of
    the points.

Quaternion Attributes:
    Quaternion (`float[4]`) attributes to deform.

Enable Sliding:
    Use this parameter to have points blend their deformation position
    between a fully deformed position and a rest pose position.  This
    is primarily meant to be used with metaball fields defined by the
    [Muscle Object|Node:obj/muscle].  The __Rest Anchor__ parameter on
    this object establishes a rest position relative to the specified
    rest anchor for each metaball in the muscle geometry.  Note that
    to generate the effect of muscles sliding under the surface of a
    character's skin, the skin must be [Inflated|Node:sop/inflate]
    over the muscle surface.  The [Deform Muscle SOP|Node:sop/deformmuscle]
    consolidates these effects in to a single operator.

Sliding Modifier:
    The amount of sliding to allow during deformation when
    __Enable Sliding__ is on. If this
    parameter is set to zero, then points in the captured geometry
    stick perfectly to the capturing metaballs during deformation and no
    sliding occurs. If this parameter is set to one, then points do
    not stick to the underlying metaballs at all. This parameter may be
    modified on a per-point basis using the
    [Slide Modifier Paint|Node:sop/slidemodifierpaint] operation.

@inputs

Captured Geometry:
    This must be the output of a [Capture Metaball
    SOP|Node:sop/capturemeta] (that is, geometry with the `metaCapture`
    point attribute set).

@outputs

The deformed geometry. The output does not include the
metaballs.
