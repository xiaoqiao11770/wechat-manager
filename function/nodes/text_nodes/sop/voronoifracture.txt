= Voronoi Fracture =

"""Fractures the input geometry by performing a Voronoi decomposition
of space around the input cell points"""

The Voronoi fracture SOP takes two primary inputs: the mesh to
fracture, and the points around which to build each Voronoi cell.
Often these points will be generated by either the
[Scatter SOP|Node:sop/scatter], or the
[Points From Volume SOP|Node:sop/pointsfromvolume], but any source of
points will work.  For a solid fracture (where the interior
surface of the object is built for each piece) it is very useful to
have all the points reside within the volume, in which case one
fractured piece will be generated for for each cell point.  Pieces cut by
this SOP can be further [clustered|#clustering] together based on attribute
values on the input points.  An optional third input can provide an SDF Volume
to be used in depth sampling when generating [detail|#interiordetail] on the
interior surfaces.

== Tips ==
    - Using points scattered in a density volume generated from the
      geometry using [IsoOffset|Node:sop/isooffset] is a flexible way
      to generate cell points, as you can modulate the density in the volume
      before scattering to get more points within particular regions of the
      object.  Where there is higher point density, the Fracture SOP will
      generate more, smaller pieces.
    - Mesh complexity slows down fracturing more than anything.
      PolyReduce before fracturing if you can.
    - When testing fractures, turning off __Create Inside Surface__ will
      speed things up and should look the same on the surface of the
      object.
    - If you have problems with insufficient point density in
      long appendages or something in the input object, try
      [scattering|Node:sop/scatter] points after using
      [IsoOffset|Node:sop/isooffset] and scaling the density up in those
      areas.
    - You can object merge the `CONSTRAINT_NETWORK SOP` from inside of
      this node to recover the connectivity graph of the pieces.
      This is useful for feeding into a glue constraint network.


@inputs
    Geometry to Fracture:
	The polygonal geometry that will be fractured according to the
	Voronoi decomposition.

    Points for Voronoi Cells:
	Input points, where each point represents a Voronoi cell around
	which to fracture the geometry.

    Optional SDF For Depth Sampling:
	An optional SDF Volume, usually created by
	[IsoOffset|Node:sop/isooffset], to use for depth sampling when
	creating [interior detail|#interiordetail]. If not connected, this node will generate a default one.

@parameters

Group to Fracture:
    The geometry to be fractured.
    
    If no group is specified, the full input geometry will be
    fractured.

Fuse Points:
    The incoming geometry will have its points fused together.  This
    can help detect closed objects to provide proper shattering of
    solid objects where points were uniqued for shading.  However, it
    can also change the incoming topology, so if the geometry has
    already been properly fused, this should not be used.

Create Inside Surfaces:
    Creates inside faces. 

Connect Inside Edges:
    Connects the inside faces of the fractured geometry to the corresponding outside faces.

Cusp Interior Normals:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the interior geometry, so that they will have a cusped appearance.

Cusp Interior Normals Angle:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the interior geometry with angles greater than this angle, so that they will have a cusped appearance.

Cusp Exterior Normals:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the input geometry, so that they will have a cusped appearance.
    If the input geometry already has normals, you may want to disable this.

Cusp Exterior Normals Angle:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the input geometry with angles greater than this angle, so that they will have a cusped appearance.
    If the input geometry already has normals, you may want to disable this.

Cusp Interior Edges by Uniquing Points:
    Cusps the edges of the interior geometry by duplicating points.  This can result in disconnected geometry, so __Cusp Interior Normals__ is recommended instead.

Visualize Pieces:
    Allows you to visualize fractured geometry by applying a random color to each piece.

Use Cell Point Group:
    Only fracture pieces around the input points in the group or
    pattern specified in the __Cell Point Group__ parameter.
    
Cell Point Group:
    The point group from the input cell points around which to
    fracture.

Cluster Display Mode:
    Ignore Clustering:
        When __Use Cell Point Group__ and __Cluster__ are enabled, only cut
	those pieces directly specified in the __Cell Point Group__ parameter,
	ignoring any clustered pieces.
    Keep Any Clustered Pieces:
        Fracture and output any pieces clustered to the specified
	pieces as well.
    Keep Clustered Pieces Only For Primary Point:
        When clustering, each piece is associated with a primary
	point which is the point with the lowest point number in the cluster.
	Only output pieces for this cluster if this primary point is specified
	in __Cell Point Group__.
    
== Cut ==

Triangulation:
    Auto Detect: 
        Determine whether the input points are 1D, 2D, or 3D and
	generate a triangulation for them.
    2D:
        Assume points are 2D and triangulate.
    3D:
        Assume points are 3D and tetrahedralize.
    Use Existing:
        Use an existing triangulation on the input points.
    
Connectivity Partition:
    None:
        Do not further partition pieces into groups by connectivity.
    Overwrite Piece Numbering:
	Normally each input cell point will create one output piece
	group.  However, with concave objects this can mean that
	disconnected pieces of geometry are placed in the same piece
	group.  Enabling this option will further divide the pieces
	into separate, connected groups of geometry.  This option
	allows the piece numbers to be overwritten by this operation,
	which is fast and acceptable if you don't need the piece
	numbers to match the input point numbers.
    Maintain Piece Numbering:
        This option uses a slower algorithm to ensure that piece
	numbers remain consistent with input point numbers.
    
Cut Plane Offset:
    Offsets the cut plane between adjacent cell points before cutting.
    Increasing this has the effect of putting space between each fractured
    piece.
    
Optimize Cutting Based on Clustering:
    When clustering is enabled, avoid cutting any pieces that are
    fully surrounded by pieces in the same cluster.
	
    NOTE:
        Enabling this option means that the geometry will be
	re-fractured any time the __Cluster__ parameters are changed.
    
== Cluster == (clustering)

Cluster Pieces:
    Fuse the individual pieces into larger clusters based on their
    input points sharing a common, non-zero cluster attribute value.
    Values for this attribute can come from attributes on the input
    points, or from noise as specified below.
    
Add Cluster Noise:
    Add cellular noise to any input points with a zero cluster
    attribute value.
    
Size:
    The size of the cells for the noise added to the input points.  This 
    roughly corresponds to the size of the clusters.

Offset:
    The offset of the cellular noise added to the input points.

Jitter:
    The jitter of the cellular noise added to the input points.
    
Random Detachment:
    Randomly detach pieces from clusters.
    
Detach Seed:
    The random seed used for detachment.
    
Detach Ratio:
    The probability that a particular piece will be detached.

Create Constraint Network:
    If selected, the constraint network in the internal `CONSTRAINT_NETWORK SOP` will have its primitive values overwritten if the edge marks a connection between two clustered pieces.  Also, fusing won't be performed, since the network will be presumed to handle holding the clusters together.

Within Cluster Constraint Strength:
    The strength of glue bonds between two pieces in the same cluster.

Between Cluster Constraint Strength:
    The strength of glue bonds between two pieces in different clusters.
    
Cluster Attribute:
    The name of the cluster attribute.
    
Attribute Tolerance:
    Pieces will be considered in the same cluster if their cluster
    attribute value is within this tolerance.
    
Fuse Tolerance:
    Pieces in the same cluster are fused together with this tolerance.
    
== Interior Detail ==  (interiordetail)

Add Interior Detail:
    Add additional polygons to the interior surfaces created when
    __Create Inside Surfaces__ is enabled.

Visualize Noise Scale:
    Add color to the pieces to indicate the amount of noise applied at
    each point.

Triangulate Non-Planar Detail:
    The __Add Interior Detail__ option can create non-planar quadrilaterals.
    This option will triangulate the interior detail.
    
Detail Size:
    The size of the polygons added to the interior surfaces.
    
Noise Type:
    The type of noise added to the interior points.
    
Frequency:
    The frequency of the noise added to the interior points.

Offset:
    The offset of the noise added to the interior points.
    
Turbulence:
    The turbulence of the noise added to the interior points.
    
Depth Volume Resolution:
    Resolution of the default depth sampling SDF.
    
    The amplitude of the noise added to the interior points is scaled
    by the depth of the point within the surface of the original geometry,
    calculated by sampling an SDF of the geometry.  If an SDF is not
    connected to the third input of the SOP, a default one will be
    created at this resolution.
    
Clamp Displacement Amount to Depth:
    Limit the amount of displacement done at a point by its depth
    within the surface.
    
    When adding high amplitude noise to the interior points, it's
    possible that the interior surface could interpenetrate the exterior.
    This option will clamp the amount of displacement at a particular
    point by the depth within the surface. 
    
Clamp Depth Percentage:
    The percentage of the depth within the surface to which the
    displacement should be clamped.
    
    Because an SDF is not a perfect representation of depth, this
    option allows you to clamp to a percentage of the depth.  Lowering
    this can guarantee no interpenetration, at the expense of more
    clamping of the interior noise.
    
Depth / Noise Bias:
    The value for the bias curve that maps depth within the surface to
    the amplitude of the noise applied.

Use Depth / Noise Ramp:
    Use a ramp control for more precise control of the depth / noise
    mapping.
    
Depth / Noise Ramp:
    The ramp that maps from depth within the surface to the amplitude
    of the noise applied.
