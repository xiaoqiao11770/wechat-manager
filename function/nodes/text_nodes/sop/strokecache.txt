"""Simplifies the building of tools that incrementally modify geometry based on strokes."""

This node records strokes using the Stroke State [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke]. The Geometry plugged into the first input is run through a [For Each SOP|Node:sop/foreach], with one iteration per recorded stroke. Within this [For Each|Node:sop/foreach], it's possible to set up a SOP network that modifies the input geometry based on the shape and attributes of the recorded stroke.

The geometry is cached after each stroke, so that each stroke only requires the [For Each|Node:sop/foreach] to cook for that one new stroke.
