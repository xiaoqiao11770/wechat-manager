= Volume Reduce =

"""Reduces the values of a volume into a single number."""

The Volume Reduce operation reduces all of the voxel values of a volume into a
single value. This can be used to determine properties of a volume, such as the minimum or maximum value.

Volume reduce will also blur the volume; however, it is different from [Volume Blur|Node:sop/volumeblur] because volume reduce is an intermediate step, not an end result. It will affect the whole volume, not just pieces of the volume.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be reduced.
    Reduction:
	The types of reduction to be performed.

	    Maximum:
		Find largest element of the input volume.
	    Minimum:
		Find minimum element of the input volume.
	    Maximum of Absolute:
		Find largest absolute element of the input volume.
	    Minimum of Absolute:
		Find minimum absolute element of the input volume.
	    Average:
		The sum of the input volume divided by the number of
		voxels.  
	    Median:
		Voxels of the input volume are sorted lowest to
		highest, the one at the given percentile is picked.
		This is as slow as it sounds.  A value of 50 will give
		you the median, 25 the first quartile, etc.
	    Sum:
		The total of all voxels.
	    Sum of Absolute:
		The total of the absolute value of all the voxels.
	    Sum of Squares:
		The total of the square each voxel.
	    Root Mean Square:
		The square root of the average of the squares of all
		of the voxels.  

    Percentile:
	Used by the median reduction method to determine which
	percentile voxel will be extracted.

    Scale By:
	Depending on the dimensions of the input field, you may want
	to also apply an additional scale to make the result
	independent of your voxel resolution.

	Note that tapered volumes do not have a consistent scale so
	their behavior is less well defined.

	None:
	    Do not apply any scaling effects.
	By Voxel Length:
	    Scale by the length of a voxel, defined as the cube root
	    of the voxel's volume.
	By Voxel Area:
	    Scale by the area of the voxel, defined as the square of
	    the cube root of the voxel's volume.  Use this to turn the
	    result of an SDF to Surface into a surface area.
	By Voxel Volume:
	    Scale by the volume of the voxel.  Use this to turn the
	    result of an SDF to Fog into a volume.

    Store Results In:
	Determines where the final computed value is stored.  If it is set to
	volume, the volume is replaced by a constant volume of the given value.
	The volume will also be changed to streaked border condition, so no
	matter where it is sampled the reduced value will be returned.

	The other result choices will store on the appropriate attribute.  If
	the attribute does not exist, a single float attribute of the given
	name is created.  In the case of a detail attribute, the detail
	attribute will be of the same size as the number of volumes involved in
	the reduction.

    Attribute:
	The name of the attribute to store the value in.

    Local Variable:
	The local variable to create for the attribute.  If blank, the
	attribute in upper case will be used.
