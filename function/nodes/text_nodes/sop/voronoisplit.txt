= Voronoi Split =

"""Cuts the geometry into small pieces according to a set of cuts
defined by polylines."""

Voronoi Split cuts geometry according to a set of polylines.  Each
line describes a cut along its mid point.  Lines are best created with
the [Tetrahedralize SOP|Node:sop/tetrahedralize].

This is a utility SOP which is similar to the [Voronoi Fracture SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracture], but without any of the extra features. [Voronoi Fracture|Node:sop/voronoifracture] should typically be used instead of Voronoi Split.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of the input geometry to split.
    Clip Points Group:
	Lines leaving these points will be used as clipping lines.
	Each point will correspond to a new piece.
    Offset:
	Instead of cutting at the mid point, it is offset by this
	percentage along the line.
    Create Interior Surfaces:
	The interior faces of cutting the polygons are created.  This
	requires the input be a closed watertight manifold.
    Stamp Pieces with Point Numbers:
	Creates attributes storing the original point number and piece
	number.  This allows one to build a stable correspondence
	between your input points and the resulting polygons.
