= Volume SDF =

"""Builds a Signed Distance Field from an isocontour of a volume."""

The Volume SDF operation rebuilds a signed distance field from a given
isocontour in a volume.  The new SDF is the same resolution as the
original volume.

This can be used to turn a fog volume into an SDF to get fast distance
computations.  It can also be used to renormalize a signed distance
field that has been stretched away from its ideal shape.

The boundary condition of the volume will be changed to SDF by this
SOP.  To change it to constant or streak, use the Primitive SOP.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be used.
    Iso Surface:
	The iso contour to rebuild on.  This will become the 0 contour
	of the new SDF.  For fog volumes 0.5 is good.  For SDF
	sources, 0 is usually good.
    Invert:
	Invert the sense of the generated SDF.  By default the sign of
	the SDF will match the original, so higher values in the
	original are higher values in the result.  However, with fog
	volumes, you likely want the opposite so the white areas of
	fog become negative, hence inside.
    Use Maximum Distance:
	Stops the conversion when a certain distance from the
	isocontour is reached.  This is very useful if you only care
	about a certain band around the surface as it can avoid
	computing the value for the rest of the voxels.
    Maximum Distance:
	Distance in object space to compute.  Voxels farther than this
	distance will be clamped to +/- this distance.
