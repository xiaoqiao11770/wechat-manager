:vimeo:UV flatten
    #id: 116671338

UV Flatten tries to preserve shapes/polygon angles when mapping the 3D mesh to flat UV coordinates. It has an interactive mode that lets you specify seams and pin vertices.

This node will add the UV texture attribute to the geometry if it doesn't already exist.

* You can manually specify "seams" along which the node will cut the geometry into pieces for flattening. This lets you split the surface into manageable sections to make it easier for the node to flatten.

    If the polygonal surface has an [edge group|/model/groups] named `seams`, this node will use it to cut the geometry. You can select additional seams interactively when the node is selected.

* You can pin certain vertices to fixed UV coordinates.

    Each piece must have at least two pins. If you don't specify pins manually, the node will simply pick two vertices to pin automatically. You only need to manually pin where the automatic solution isn't ideal, for example, if you want to move, rotate, or scale a piece.
    
    You can interactively add pins, and select multiple pins and move them while the node maintains the positions of unselected pins, when the node is selected.

UV Flatten scales the pieces to fit within the unit square (u of 0 to 1, v of 0 to 1), while maintaining their proportions relative to each other.

This node uses the [Least Squares Conformal Mapping|Wp:Least_squares_conformal_map] (LSCM) method to flatten the texture coordinates.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group
    
    The primitives to add UV texture coordinates to.
    If this is empty, the node applies to all incoming primitives.

Seam Group:
    #id: seamgroup
    
    An edge group containing the initial seams to use
    to split the geometry into texture pieces.
    The node automatically considers boundary edges,
    edges between inconsistently oriented polygons,
    and edges between more than two polygons as seams. 

Additional Seams:
    #id: extraseamgroup
    
    An edge group containing the 
    
    When you add seams interactively, the node puts them in this parameter.
    The initial seams you selected when you first used the tool
    are in the __Seam group__ parameter.
    The node keeps these separate to preserve the positions of the pieces as you cut.
    If you edit __Seam group__
    (for example, by cutting and pasting the contents of __Additional seams__ into it),
    the node will re-pack the pieces.

Use Existing UV Coordinates:
    #id: useexistinguv
    
    If the geometry already has texture coordinates,
    ignore the 3D geometry and flatten any existing UV coordinates instead.
    
    This may be useful to let you use this node's interactive mode
    to edit existing UV coordinates while minimizing distortions.

Create Island Number Attribute:
    #id: islandprimtoggle
    
    Creates an `island` primitive attribute containing a number
    specifying which pieces the primitive belongs to.
    For example, all primitives on the first piece would have a value
    of `0` in the attribute.

Create Pin Groups:
    #id: createpingroups

    Creates two vertex groups containing the initial pins
    (the pins chosen automatically by the node)
    and active pins (initial pins and pins added interactively by the user).

Initial Pin Group:
    #id: initialpingroup

    When __Create Pin Groups__ is on, the name of the vertex group
    containing the pins chosen automatically by the node.

Active Pin Group:
    #id: activepingroup
    
    When __Create Pin Groups__ is on, the name of the vertex group
    containing the initial pins and pins created interactively by the user.

Pins:
    #id: pins

    The list of interactively pinned vertices.
