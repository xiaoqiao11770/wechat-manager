"""Provides operations for moving knots within the parametric space
of a NURBS curve or surface."""

This op provides a set of operations applicable to the parametric space
of spline curves and surfaces. The parametric space, also known as the
"domain" of a NURBS or Bezier primitive, is defined by one basis in the
U direction and, if the primitive is a surface, another basis in the V
direction. The size of the domain is given by the values of the knots
that make up the basis.

The Basis op contains both ratio-preserving and non ratio-preserving
operations.

If the basis reparameterization does not change the distance ratios
between knots, the shape of a NURBS primitive is not affected. If the
ratios are not preserved; however, a NURBS primitive will change shape
in the area influenced by the modified knots. Additionally, if the
primitive is a NURBS or Bezier surface, any profiles it may contain will
be affected as well.
