"""Transfers vertex, point, primitive, and/or
detail attributes between two models."""

NOTE:
    Attribute transfer works by _proximity_. It transfers attributes
    from one piece of geometry to the closest points on a different
    piece of geometry, so you can copy the attributes from one model
    to another even if they have completely different topologies.
    
    If you want to copy attributes between models with the same
    topology, use [Attrib Copy|Node:sop/attribcopy] instead, because
    it's much faster.

TIP:
    If you wire the same geometry into both inputs of this node, you
    can use it to "blur" attributes across surfaces.

The attributes may be explicitly specified in the corresponding
attribute text field. Exclusion is specified by preceding an attribute
name with the caret character (^). All available attributes can be
specified by leaving the field blank or entering an asterisk (*) in the
field. If the first attribute is preceded by a caret then all attributes
are assumed to be transferred except where explicitly excluded. In all
other cases, no attributes are assumed except where explicitly
included.

Destination attributes are interpolated from the source attributes using
a weighted proximity technique. Proximities used in point attribute
calculations are determined as the distance between the destination
point and the candidate source points. For primitive attribute
calculations, the barycenter-to-barycenter distance between the
destination primitive and the candidate source primitives is used. In
the case of vertex attributes, each destination vertex is first mapped
to the closest position and primitive in the source geometry. The vertex
attribute is then determined using a barycentric-like interpolation
technique. The source detail attribute is simply copied to the
destination detail attribute.

The __Conditions__ tab contains several parameters that control how the
source attributes are combined, or filtered, to give the resulting
destination values. The __Kernel Function__ can be set to any available
metaball kernel. The kernels are parameterized by distance and typically
give more weight to source points/primitives/vertices that are closer.
The __Max Sample Count__ parameter specifies the maximum number of
points/primitives/vertices to interpolate from. A maximum sample count
of 1 gives nearest neighbor interpolation. The __Kernel Radius__
specifies the drop-off radius for the kernel function. As the kernel
radius parameter approaches zero, the filter resembles nearest neighbor
interpolation. As the kernel radius parameter increases, the filter
approaches uniform weighting. The __Distance Threshold__ parameter
specifies the maximum distance source points/primitives must be to be
considered. Switching off this option indicates that no
points/primitives will be excluded based on distance. Within the
distance threshold, the final attributes are determined solely from the
source selection. In cases where all source points/primitives/vertices
lie beyond the distance threshold, the destination attributes remain
unchanged. The __Blend Width__ parameter relaxes the distance threshold
and optionally sets a region outside the distance threshold where the
influence of the source attributes gradually tapers off. In this region,
the interpolated source attribute value is blended with the original
destination attribute value using the selected kernel function to
produce the interpolation factors. In this blending process, the blend
width is used as the kernel radius. The __Uniform Bias__ parameter
specifies the linear interpolation factor that is used when blending
with the Uniform kernel function. The Uniform Bias value is used as the
source blending factor, whereas the destination blending factor is set
to one minus this value.


@parameters

Source Group:
    A subset of the source geometry where attribute values are
    transferred from.
Source Group Type:
    The type of elements referenced in the Source Group field.
Destination Group:
    A subset of the destination geometry where attribute values are
    transferred to.
Destination Group Type:
    The type of elements referenced in the Destination Group field.
Detail:
    Source detail attributes to transfer.
Primitives:
    Source primitive attributes to transfer.
Points:
    Source point attributes to transfer.
Vertices:
    Source vertex attributes to transfer.
Copy Local Variables:
    All local variables referring to the copied attributes are also copied.
Match P Attribute:
    If enabled, patterns used in the __Points__ parameter can match the `P`
    attribute.
Kernel Function:
    Interpolating  [metaball
    kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels] .
Max Sample Count:
    Number of closest samples to interpolate from.
Kernel Radius:
    Radial extent of the kernel function.
Distance Threshold:
    Radial extent of the filter domain where the final attributes
    are determined from the source selection only.
Blend Width:
    The radial extent beyond the distance threshold where the final
    attributes are blended from the source and destination
    selections using the Kernel Function and the Blend Width as the
    kernel radius. In regions outside the Distance Threshold + Blend
    Width, the destination attributes remain unchanged.
Uniform Bias:
    The linear interpolation factor that is used when blending with
    the Uniform kernel function. This value is used for the source,
    whereas the destination factor is set to '1 - Uniform Bias'.
