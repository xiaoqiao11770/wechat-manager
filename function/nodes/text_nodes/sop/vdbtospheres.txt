"""Fills a VDB volume with adaptively-sized spheres."""

This node is useful for generating proxy geometry for RBD simulations since
converting non convex polygons into sphere compounds drastically improves the
simulation time. This can be used for example, on the output of a
[Node:sop/vdbfracture].

It is also useful for cloud modeling, to produce the initial density volume.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of VDB primitives to fill. See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.

Isovalue:
    The crossing point of the VDB values that is considered the surface.  A value of `0` works for signed distance fields, and `0.5` is a better choice for fog VDBs.

Min Radius in Voxels:
    Determines the smallest sphere size in voxel units.

Max Radius in Voxels:
    Determines the largest sphere size in voxel units.

Max Spheres:
    No more than this number of spheres are generated per VDB primitive.
    
Scatter Points:
    Maximum number of interior points to consider for the sphere placement. Increasing this count increases the chances of finding optimal sphere sizes.
    
Overlapping:
    When enabled, spheres will be allowed to overlap/intersect.

Preserve Attributes and Groups:
    Enable to copy attributes and groups from the input.

Add ID Attribute:
    Enable to add an `id` point attribute that corresponds to different VDBs.
