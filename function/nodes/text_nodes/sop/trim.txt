= Trim =

"""Trims away parts of a spline surface defined by a profile curve
or untrims previous trims."""

With the Trim op you can cut out parts of a spline surface, or uncut
previously cut pieces. When a portion of the surface is trimmed, it is
not actually removed from the surface; instead, that part is made
invisible. This means that you can still modify the surface (modify the
position of its points, for instance) that is not displayed in order to
affect the part that is displayed.

The surface can be trimmed by specifying open or closed profiles as
inside or outside regions. The profiles need not be contained within the
domain (UV space) of the surface; they can also be nested.

Open profiles are treated as follows: if both ends of the profile are
inside the surface, the ends are connected to one another; if the
profile's ends are outside the domain of the surface they are projected
onto, that part of the surface appears to be cut away.

You will usually need a Trim SOP, [Bridge SOP|Node:sop/bridge], or
[Profile SOP|Node:sop/profile] after a [Project SOP|Node:sop/project].

* Use a Trim SOP to cut a hole in the projected surface.

* Use a [Bridge SOP|Node:sop/bridge] to skin the profile curve to
  another profile curve.

* Use a [Profile SOP|Node:sop/profile] to extract the curve on surface
  or remap it's position.

== Selection Method: Winding Rule ==

    The selection method employed for clarifying overlapping trim loops
    is the _winding rule_, which executes overlapping commands instead
    of having them cancel each other out.


    TIP:
        Since only surfaces containing profile curves can be trimmed,
        you will always need a [Project SOP|Node:sop/project] or [Carve
        SOP|Node:sop/carve] in the chain above the Trim SOP.

== Example ==

    The following results were obtained by using a [Project
    SOP|Node:sop/project] to project two NURBS circles onto a NURBS
    grid. Then two Trim SOPs were added, one after the other, to the
    [Project SOP|Node:sop/project]. The first Trim SOP was set to _Keep
    Inside_, while the second Trim SOP had its operation changed as
    indicated.

    geometry.


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of profiles to use as trim curves.
    Trimming operation:
        Lists the types of trimming operations available:

        Keep Outside:
            Remove the area of the surface enclosed by the curve.
        Keep Inside:
            Remove the area outside the curve.
        Keep Natural:
            Trim based on the natural orientation of the profiles, be
            they open or not. Counter-clockwise profiles keep their
            interior, generating a result similar to "Keep Inside".
            Clockwise profiles discard their interior, similar to "Keep
            Outside", and may require an explicit outer trim-loop if
            none present.
        Untrim:
            Undo the trimming operation associated with the trim curve
            and turn the trim curve into a plain profile curve. Use the
            Delete operation to remove the profile entirely; this also
            applies to explicitly built outer-trim loops, which are
            regular profiles.
        Change Altitude:
            If the trim loops are viewed as contours on a map, the
            altitude is the "sea level" which marks the transition from
            trim in to trim out. $ALTITTUDE is the local variable
            containing the surfaces current altitude.
    Process profiles individually:
        Generate a trim region out of of each profile or treat the
        whole group as one.
    Build outer-trim loop explicitly:
        Generate a trim loop around the surface boundary. One is
        created automatically when a surface is trimmed for the first
        time if "Keep Outside" is on.
    Trimming Tolerance:
        #channels: /trimtol

        How close two trim curves must be to each other or to the edge
        of the patch to be considered an intersection.
    Altitude:
        #channels: /altitude

        The new altitude for the surface.
