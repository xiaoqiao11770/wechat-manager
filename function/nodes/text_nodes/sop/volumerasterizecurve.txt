= Volume Rasterize Curve =

"""Converts a curve into a volume."""

The Volume Rasterize operation takes a curve and creates a VDB volume based on it. It has been designed to complement [Draw Curve SOP|Node:sop/drawcurve] since it will use point attributes created by the [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke] such as `stroke_pressure`, but will work with a standard curve created using a [Draw Curve|Node:sop/drawcurve]. It will create the needed attributes with default values of 1. The volumes created are based on the __Output__ parameters.

The point attributes `pscale` and `density` are used to control the generated volume. They are derived from `width` and `stroke_pressure` that are created by the [Draw Curve|Node:sop/drawcurve]/[Stroke|Node:sop/stroke] SOPs. If missing, it will create those values at default value of 1.

This asset is used as a building block in [Paint Color Volume|Node:sop/paintcolorvolume],
[Paint Mask Volume|Node:sop/paintmaskvolume], [Paint SDF Volume|Node:sop/paintsdfvolume].

NOTE:
        If missing stroke point attributes this asset will create default ones set to 1.

@parameters
    Output:
        Type of volume created. __Color__ creates a float density field and a vector 3 `Cd` field. __Mask__ creates a float density field. __SDF__ creates a float signed surface field.

== Volume ==
    Voxel Size:
        Size of the voxels of the created volume

 
== Brush ==
    Fast Composite (Color Output):
        Multiple volumes are merged together with their densities unaffected. When off the volumes are combined according to their density which is treated like an alpha channel.
    Fast Rasterize (Mask Output):
        When on the setup uses [Volume Rasterize Particles|Node:sop/volumerasterizeparticles] which has minimal controls but is much faster than [Volume Rasterize Points|Node:sop/volumerasterizepoints].
    Density Scale:
        Density field multiplier.
    Sample Rate:
        Distance used to sample the curves.
    Fade:
        Falloff of the density over the length of the stroke curve.
    Flow Rate:
        Strength of the density created over the length of the stroke curve.
   Merge Method (Mask Output):
        Specifies which operation is used when merging multiple curves densities.
