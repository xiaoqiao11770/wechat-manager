"""Overrides the capture weights on individual points."""

This causes any changes to the affected capture weights in the input to be
ignored.

The CaptureOverride operates by applying the current operation to the
stored overrides. To store the current operation and start a new one,
click the "Start new weight" button.

As of 8.0.335 this operator does not have a way to select points interactively in SOPs. As a work around you can bind your own selector to it by using omsbind hdox://houdini/content/commands/commands/omsbind.xml

@parameters

    == Operation ==

        Group:
            The points to modify.
        Capture Regions:
            A string composed of the paths to the capture regions to
            affect. Quotes are necessary around individual paths. For
            example, "chain_bone1/cregion 0" specifies use of primitive
            0 in the operation named cregion in the chain_bone1 object.
        Operation:
            The operation to perform on the stored overrides. mode will
            read the attribute from the surface into the
            foreground/background color.

            None:
                Do nothing.
            Replace Existing Override:
                Replaces the weight of the specified capture regions in
                the override. Creates an override if none exists.
            Add to Existing Override:
                Adds the weight to the weights of the specified capture
                regions in the override. Creates an override if none
                exists.
            Create Override:
                Create an override by recording the current capture
                weights.
            Remove Override:
                Remove an existing override.
            Normalize Existing Override:
                Normalize the capture weights relative to the specified
                capture regions. Creates an override if none exists.
        Weight:
            The weight of the capture region to use in all of the
            points. The operation parameter affects how this is
            interpreted.
        Normalize Weights:
            Scale the weights of the other capture region to maintain
            weights which sum to 1.
        Start new weight:
            Applies the current operation as defined by the parameters
            to the stored overrides and resets the parameters to allow
            the start of a new operation.
        Reset All Overrides:
            Restores geometry to initial state.
        Update point colors:
            Adds diffuse point colors to the geometry to show the effect
            of the modified capture weights.
        Zero Weight Point Color:
            Specifies the color to use for zero weighted points when
            "Update point colors" is on.
