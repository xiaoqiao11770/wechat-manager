= Vortex Force Attributes =

"""Creates the point attributes needed to create a Vortex Force DOP."""

Vortex Force Attributes creates point attributes on a curve that are required
by the Vortex Force DOP. These attributes are used by the Vortex Force DOP to
define the precise behavior of the force. This SOP should be appended to a SOP
that generates a single open curve. For each point in the input geometry, the
various vortex attributes are calculated based on the value of this node's
parameters as they vary over time. Using keyframes, it is possible to draw
contours that vary the vortex attributes along the length of the curve.


@parameters
    Radius:
        #channels: /rad
        The radius at which objects should be made to orbit around
        the vortex curve.

    Velocity:
        #channels: /vel
        The velocity at which objects should be made to orbit around
        the vortex curve. This value specifies the tangential velocity,
        rather than an angular velocity. To achieve a particular angular
        velocity, scale this value by the two time Pi times the radius
        value.

    Direction:
        #channels: /dirx /diry /dirz
        The normal to the plane across which objects should orbit the
        vortex curve. If this parameter is toggled off, the tangent of
        the curve is used as the normal for the plane of revolution.

    Maximum Distance:
        #channels: /maxd
        The maximum radius of influence for the vortex force. Any object
        further than this distance from the curve will not be affected by
        the force.

    Lift:
        #channels: /lift
        The amount of lift exerted by the vortex force. The lift force
        is in the direction specified by the Direction parameter.

    Countour Range:
        #channels: /range
        The end of the frame range across which the above parameters are
        evaluated. The points on the curve are sampled evenly along this
        frame range, and get their attribute values by evaluating the
        above parameters at those different times. Thus all of these
        parameters can be animated in time to generate a contour in
        space for the vortex force.
