= UV Project =

"""Assigns UVs by projecting them onto the surface from
a set direction."""

UVProject creates the UV texture attribute if it does not already exist.
The attribute class (Vertices or Points) is determined by the Group
Type. It is recommended that UVs be applied to vertices, since this
allows fine control on polygonal geometry and the ability to fix seams
at the boundary of a texture.

[Include:texture_common#visualizePara]

NOTE:
    For closed mesh, Bezier and NURBS surfaces, projections with boundaries
    will result in seams. UVTexture can be used to open these surfaces
    automatically. Alternatively, convert the surface to polygons using
    a Convert operation prior to applying UVProject.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to apply texture UV coordinates to.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field, and the
        class of UV texture attribute to use.
    Projection:
        Type of projection geometry to use.
    Inner Radius:
        #channels: /torrad

        Inner radius of the torus used in a Toroidal projection. The
        outer radius is always 0.5.

    == Transformation ==

        Transform Order:
            Order in which transformations occur.
        Rotate Order:
            Order in which rotations occur.
        Translate:
            #channels: /tx /ty /tz

            Amount of translation along xyz axes.
        Rotate:
            #channels: /rx /ry /rz

            Amount of rotation about xyz axes.
        Scale:
            #channels: /sx /sy /sz

            Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.
        Pivot:
            #channels: /px /py /pz

            Local pivot point for transformations.

    == Initialize ==

        Method:
            Specify how to initialize the transform when the Initialize
            button is used.
        Initialize:
            Automatically fit the projection geometry to the group's
            bounding box.
    U Range:
        #channels: /urange

        The location of the left and right edges, respectively, of the
        texture on the projection geometry.
    V Range:
        #channels: /vrange

        The location of the bottom and top edges, respectively, of the
        texture on the projection geometry.
    Angle:
        #channels: /angle

        Rotates texture coordinates about the point (0.5, 0.5) in UV
        texture space.
    Fix Boundary Seams:
        Makes sure the texture wraps around correctly. This only works
        for vertex UV attributes.
    Fix Poles:
        Use the UV coordinates of neighboring vertices to improve
        undefined projections at the poles of the projection geometry.
        (For example, the north and south poles of the Polar
        projection).
    Pole Radius:
        #channels: /polerad

        The distance from the exact pole within which a vertex is
        treated as being in that pole.
