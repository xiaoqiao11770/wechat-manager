"""Evolves polygonal curves as vortex filaments."""

The Filament Advect SOP evolves vortex filaments by advecting each filament's points by a velocity field.

Vortex filaments express a fluid's velocity by specifying the centers of smoke rings (represented as closed polygonal curves) instead of an explicit grid.
As a result, the fluid is unbounded and an arbitrarily detailed velocity field can be reconstructed from only a few curves.
Since the fluid motion is entirely described by the vortex filaments, the number of particles used for rendering can be adjusted without affecting the fluid's behavior.

@parameters

Time Step:
    Specifies the length of time over which to advect the filaments.

Scale Strength:
    Adjusts the strength of each filament. The `strength` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

Scale Thickness:
    Adjusts the thickness of each filament. The `thickness` primitive attribute will be multiplied by this value.

Reconnect Distance:
    The simulator will attempt to reconnect filaments with approximately anti-parallel edges, as the effects of such edges approximately cancel out. This can prevent
    the number of polygon edges from increasing exponentially over time. Increasing this value will cause filaments to be reconnected more aggressively.

Min Edge Length:
    Edges shorter than this length will be removed by collapsing those edges to their center point.

Max Edge Length:
    Edges that are longer than this length will be subdivided.

Cap Speed:
    Limits the speed of the filament vertices.

Speed Cap:
    Specifies the maximum speed of a filament vertex when __Cap Speed__ is enabled.
