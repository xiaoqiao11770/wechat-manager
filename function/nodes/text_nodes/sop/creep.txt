"""Deforms and animates a piece of geometry across a surface."""

This operator changes each of the source input geometry points into a
new space. The X and Y components of the source points will become the U
and V positions on the surface. The Z component becomes a displacement
along the surface's normal at the (U, V) position.

== Inputs / Geometry Types ==

The geometry of the Source op is crept along the path of the Path
op. The path type can be any primitive, but should define a surface
(e.g. NURBS surface, primitive tube, etc.). Curve paths (circles,
polygons, etc.) will squash the source geometry's height. This op
will transform all vector attributes, even of particles. The
velocities will be altered to reflect the transformation that creep
does.

NOTE:
    NURBS surfaces might distort the crept geometry due to the
    non-uniformity of their U and V knot sequence. If the knots are
    not laid out uniformly (as in the case of a NURBS spline), knots
    closer together will squash the crept geometry in the
    corresponding surface region.

The [Grid SOP|Node:sop/grid], [Skin SOP|Node:sop/skin], [Sweep
SOP|Node:sop/sweep], [Tube SOP|Node:sop/tube], and [Sphere
SOP|Node:sop/sphere] (with __Unique Points at Poles__ on for
polygons) are some of the ops that produce usable Meshes.

The Source Input op's geometry is wrapped onto the Path's, and the
position and orientation of the Source on the Path is controlled by
the nine fields that appear at the bottom of the op: Translate,
Rotate, and Scale xyz.

The Z translate, Z scaling and X/Y rotation of the Source to the
Path depends on the surface normals of the Path's geometry.

== Uses / Works in Relation With ==

Creeping the starting profile for a filleted tube onto a surface can
be accomplished with this op. Use a [Transform SOP|Node:sop/xform]
or [Copy SOP|Node:sop/copy] to scale and translate the crept profile
generating a series of cross-sections to skin with the [Skin
SOP|Node:sop/skin].

@parameters
Group:
Subset of points to creep onto the path.
Path Group:
Primitive to creep on.

== Creep ==

Initialize:

    Fill Path:
        Values are computed that stretch or shrink the Source
        geometry to the full dimensions of the Path geometry.
    Keep Proportions:
        Similar to above, but the values are initialized so as
        to minimize distortion of object geometry.
Translate:
    #id: t

    Translate source geometry over the creep surface.
Rotate:
    #id: r

    Rotate source geometry on the creep surface.
Scale:
    #id: s

    Scale source geometry on the creep surface.
Pivot:
    #id: p

    Local pivot point for transformations. 

== Attribute ==

The parameters on this tab control how attributes on the creep
surface affect the geometry being crept.

Set Creep UV Attribute:
    Store the parametric coordinates that the source points are
    crept onto in the specified point attribute.
    
Set Point Attributes From Path:
    #id: doattr

    Copy attributes from the path geometry to the points of the
    source geometry, according to the values in the attribute
    fields below.

Attribute fields:
    (Available when __Set Point Attributes From Path__ is on
    above.)

    The _columns_ represent _possible ways of combining the
    attributes_ from the path geometry with the point attributes
    from the source geometry.

    Set:
        Copy the path attributes onto the points.
    Mult:
        Multiply the source point attributes by the
        corresponding path attributes.
    Add:
        Add the path attributes to the corresponding source
        point attributes.
    Sub:
        Subtract the path attributes from the corresponding
        source point attributes.
    
    The _rows_ represent _the different entities you can copy
    attributes from_: points, primitives, and vertices.

    At the _intersection_ of each column and row, you can enter
    a list/pattern of attributes.

    For example:

    * To copy all attribute values from the path primitive
      attributes to the point attributes of the source, set the
      field at __Set/From Prim__ to `*`.

    * To multiply source point colors by the path's primitive
      colors, set the field at __Mult/From Prim__ to `Cd`.

    * To add the point texture coordinates of the path geometry
      to the coordinates of the source, set the field at
      __Add/From Point__ to __uv__.
