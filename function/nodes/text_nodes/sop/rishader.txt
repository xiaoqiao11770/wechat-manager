= RMan Shader =

"""Attaches RenderMan shaders to groups of faces."""

There are spaces in a single RIShader operation to assign up to 6
different RenderMan shaders to 6 (possibly different) groups of
primitives. If that is not adequate then users can string a sequence of
RIShader operations together to assign more than 6 different shaders.
Note that you can override a shader assignment within a sequence of
RIShader operations.


@parameters
    Group:
        Specify the groups in question
    Shader Name:
        Name of RenderMan Shader to assign to the said group(s)
