"""Lets you interactively reshape a surface by brushing."""

- Deform mode lets you push or pull the geometry along its normals.
- Smooth mode smooths out the geometry.

@parameters

== Operation ==

Goal:
    Deform Points:
        Moves each point along its normal.
    Smooth Points:
        Moves each point towards the average of its neighbors.
        This is a per dab operation, thus does not accumulate a
        stencil buffer.
    Deform and Smooth:
        Applies both the deformation and a smoothing pass.
        
Axis, Vector:
    #channels: /vector

    Determine what direction the deformation occurs in. "Normal"
    refers to the surface normal at the point; the others are in
    the object's coordinates.
Accumulate To Stencil:
    By default, the operation is applied and the stencil cleared
    after every brush stroke. With this set, the stencil is not
    cleared until "Apply and Clear Stencil" is pressed.
Apply & Clear Stencil:
    Applies the operation and clears the stencil. This is
    equivalent to right-clicking in the viewport.
Update Displacement Normals:
    Recomputes the point normals used by the sculpting
    operation.
LMB/MMB Displacements:
    #channels: /fg /bg

    Specify the amount by which to displace the surface. If
    "Accumulate To Stencil" is on, the left mouse does
    foreground and the middle mouse erases.
Apply To All:
    Deforms all of the selected geometry.
Reset All Changes:
    Restores geometry to initial state.
