= Solid Embed =

"""Creates a simple tetrahedral mesh that covers a connected mesh."""

The Solid Embed SOP creates a simplified tetrahedral mesh that covers the input mesh. This simplified tetrahedral mesh can be used with the [Solid Object|Node:dop/solidobject] in an embedded finite element simulation. When the source mesh consists of highly detailed rendering geometry, it is much more efficient to simulate the simplified tetrahedral mesh created by Solid Embed instead of the original source mesh.

NOTE:
    The Solid Embed SOP is designed to be used only with meshes that consist of a single connected component.

To use the embedded workflow for finite elements, you can point the __Embedded Geometry__ on the [Node:dop/solidobject] to the original mesh and point the __Initial Geometry__ to the Solid Embed SOP. 

If the `fracturepart` attribute is present on the input geometry, then this attribute is transferred to the simplified mesh. This allows the finite element solver to maintain correspondences between the embedded parts and the simplified parts. The `Cd` attribute is transferred as well, to facilitate visualization.

@parameters

Element Scale:
    This parameter controls the size of the individual tets that are generated. The lower the element scale, the more tets will be generated and the more accurate the output mesh approximates the input mesh.
