"""Makes holes in surfaces."""

This makes holes where faces are enclosed, even if they are
not in the same plane. It can also remove existing holes from the input
geometry.

The holes are made by searching for faces which are enclosed by other
faces and creating bridges to the interior faces. It offers more
flexibility than either the [Extrude SOP|Node:sop/extrude] or [Divide
SOP|Node:sop/divide]'s hole-making capabilities because it can deal with
interior faces which are not exactly in the same orientation as the
exterior ones. It can also remove existing bridges that it finds in the
input geometry if needed.

NOTE:
    This op works with Polygonal and Bezier geometry types only. NURBS
    surfaces will be converted internally to Beziers.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of geometry to hole.

Un-bridge Holes:
    Removes bridges to holes in the source.

Distance Tolerance:
    #id: dist

    Maximum distance between interior geometry and exterior
    geometry.

Angle Tolerance:
    #id: angle

    Maximum rotation of interior geometry relative to exterior
    geometry.

Snap holes to outlines:
    Interior geometry is translated and rotated to be flush with
    exterior geometry.
