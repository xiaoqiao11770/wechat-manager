"""Imports fields from DOP simulations, saves them to disk, and loads
them back again."""

The DOP I/O SOP is designed to streamline the common
operation of importing many fields from fluid simulations into SOPs.
It also includes a [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] to save these fields to disk an the option to load from disk rather than use the live simulation.

@parameters

Load from Disk:
    Switches between importing fields from DOPs and loading the fields from the geometry file.
    
    NOTE:
        If you start a render, it will always use the Import option, ignoring this parameter.

Geometry File:
    Where to load the fields from when in Load from Disk mode. This also controls where the [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] will save the fields.

Import from DOPs:
    See the [Dop Import Fields SOP|Node:sop/dopimportfield] help for these parameters.

Save to File:
    See the [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] help for these parameters.

Load From File:
    See the [File SOP|Node:sop/file] help for these parameters.
