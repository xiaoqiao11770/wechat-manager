= Tri Bezier =

"""Creates a triangular Bezier surface."""

Creates a triangular Bezier surface using a user specified group of
points as the control points of the Bezier. The order of the points is
important for creating the surface. The number of points should be
(order+1)*order/2. Order 4 requires 10 points, order 3 6 points, and
order 2 (a triangle) 3 points. Extra points are ignored.

The order of the points should be as follows for an order 4 patch:

{{{
0
|\
1-2
|\|\
3-4-5
|\|\|\
6-7-8-9
}}}

@parameters
    Group:
        This is the points, in order, to be used.
    Order:
        #channels: /order

        This is the order of the resulting patch.
