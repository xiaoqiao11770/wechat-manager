= Shrinkwrap =

"""Takes the convex hull of input geometry and moves its polygons inwards along their normals."""

The Shrinkwrap operation computes the convex hull of the input geometry using
the same method as [Tetrahedralize|Node:sop/tetrahedralize], and translates the
resultant polygonal primitives inwards along their normals.
Unlike the [Peak SOP|Node:sop/peak], which takes the point and moves it according
to the average of the neighboring polygons, Shrinkwrap moves the polygons 
and recomputes their intersections, possibly creating new and removing old 
points, but maintaining polygon normal directions. Polygons with more than
three edges are divided into triangles with the same normals as the original
polygon.

@parameters
Distance:
    #channels: /dist
    
    The translation distance inwards.
        
Clip Tolerance:
	The error tolerance for computing the new point positions.

Consolidate Tolerance:
	The error tolerance for fusing points together. This is equivalent to using consolidate points in the [Facet SOP|Node:sop/facet].
