= Trace =

"""Traces curves from an image file."""

This node reads an image file and automatically traces it, generating
a set of faces around areas exceeding a certain brightness threshold.
You can control this threshold and the resolution of the resulting
faces.

== Uses / Works in Relation With ==

    Commonly followed by an [Extrude SOP|Node:sop/extrude] to generate
    beveled objects from logos, scans of geographical maps, etc. It can
    be animated by reading in a series of images.


@parameters

    == Trace ==

        Threshold:
            #channels: /thresh

            Minimum brightness level that should be traced.
        Add Point Texture:
            Toggles the creation of point texture UV coordinates.

    == File Switch ==

        Image Input:
            Name of the file to use.
        Scale to Size:
            #channels: /imagesize

            Loads the file at the specified image size rather than its
            actual size.

    == COP Switch ==

        COP Path:
            The path to the COP to use.
        COP Frame:
            #channels: /copframe

            Which frame(s) to use from a cop composed of a sequence of
            images.
        Planes:
            Which planes to use as the source.

    == Filters ==

        Remove Borders:
            Attempts to remove borders from the trace.
        Border Width:
            #channels: /bordwidth

            The width of border to remove.
        Resample Shapes:
            Enables the manual Step Size option
        Step Size:
            #channels: /step

            The distance between adjacent points.
        Smooth Shapes:
            Attempts to round corners.
        Corner Delta:
            #channels: /corner

            Value controlling corner smoothing.
        Fit to Curves:
            Attempts to map Bezier curves to trace.
        Fitting Error:
            #channels: /error

            Controls the accuracy of curve fitting.
        Convert to Poly:
            Converts Fit to Curves to Polygons.
        Level of Detail:
            #channels: /lod

            Density of Polygon points.
        Hole Faces:
            Bridges all holes in the output for proper rendering.
