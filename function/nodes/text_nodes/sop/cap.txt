"""Closes open areas with flat or rounded coverings."""

This node caps meshes by extending the mesh in either the U or V direction
(e.g. a NURBS tube). It caps faces by appending a separate face or hull cap.

@parameters

    == U Caps ==

        Preserve NURB Shape U:
            Clamps surface at point of capping.
        First U Cap:
            Type of cap to create:

            No end cap:
                The hull is left unmodified at this end.
            End cap faceted:
                A face with unique points is created.
            End cap shared:
                A face with shared points is created.
            End cap rounded:
                The hull is extended with a number of rows whose
                profiles are circular.
            End cap tangential:
                The hull is extended with a number of rows whose
                profiles are tangential to the original hull.
        Divisions:
            #channels: /firstcapu

            Number of cross-sections in the cap.
        Scale:
            #channels: /firstscaleu

            Height of the rounded cap.
        Last U Cap:
            Type of cap on the other end.
        Divisions:
            #channels: /lastcapu

            Number of cross-sections in the cap.
        Scale:
            #channels: /lastscaleu

            Height of the rounded cap.

    == V Caps ==

        Overview:
            #channels: /firstcapv /firstscalev /lastcapv /lastscalev

            Similar to U Caps tab, but builds caps in the other
            direction.
