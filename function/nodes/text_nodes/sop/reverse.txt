= Reverse =

"""Reverses or cycles the vertex order of faces."""

The Reverse Operation allows you to reverse or cycle the vertex order
for all faces.

This node duplicates functionality from the Face/Hull tab of the
[Primitive node|Node:sop/primitive].

@parameters
    Source Group:
        Primitive and/or profile group to operate on.
    Vertex:

        Reverse:
            Reverses U for faces, U & V for hulls
        Reverse U/V:
            Reverses U or V.
        Swap:
            Interchanges U, V. Preserves topology.
        Shift:
            Cycles vertices by U/V Offset.
    U Offset:
        #channels: /vtxuoff

        Amount to cycle vertices in U direction.
    V Offset:
        #channels: /vtxvoff

        Amount to cycle vertices in V direction.
