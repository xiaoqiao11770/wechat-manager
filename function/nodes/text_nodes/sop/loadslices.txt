"""Reads and collates distributed data from disk."""

The output of a distributed DOP simulation is often multiple sequences of
geometry files.  Each frame of the volume or particle simulation is broken into
several files.  The Load Slices SOP reassembles these into a single piece of
geometry.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    #id: file

    The name of the file to read.  It is important it has the keyword `$SLICE`
    in its name.  This will be replaced by the slice number, independent of any
    current value of that variable.

    NOTE:   
        This cannot be a channel reference or the `$SLICE` expansion will fail.

Reload Geometry:
    #id: reload

    Force a reload of the file.

Slice Range:
    The `$SLICE` variable in the file name will be replaced by this sequence of
    numbers.  The first is the start, the second the end, and the third the
    increment.  For example, to load slices 0..3 from disk, the value should be 0, 3, 1.

Delete Points from Other Slices:
    Particle simulations store a particle slice attribute when distributed.
    Since particles will show up in more than one slice, you will get
    duplicate particles if you just merge them all together.  This option will
    delete any particles that don't belong to the current slice number

Missing Slice:
    What should be done if the specified file does not exist on disk.
    By default, if no file of the given name exists, the SOP will error.  This
    can be troublesome in a network that can recover from the error.  In these
    cases the behavior can be set to __No Geometry__ so only a warning is posted.
