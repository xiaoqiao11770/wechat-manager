"""Adds color attributes to geometry."""

The color (`Cd`) attribute affects the display of the wireframe, and of faces in non-VEX shaded mode. The default shader in mantra, and many other shaders, will also use the attribute for rendering.

The added attribute may be a point, primitive, vertex, or detail
color.

NOTE:
    This is a Houdini Digital Asset and does not support local variables. To
    have different colors per element, see the other more advanced SOPs:
    [Node:sop/point], [Node:sop/primitive], [Node:sop/vertex].

@parameters
    Group:
        The geometry group to apply the color to.
    Group Type:
        What the group is made of.
    Class:
        Where to add the attribute to the geometry.
    Color Type:
        What sort of color to add. Can be one of:

        Constant:
            The same color is applied to all of the group.
        Bounding Box:
            A color gradient is applied depending on the position of the
            entity in the bounding box.
        Random:
            A random color is assigned to each group element.

    	Ramp from Attribute:
    	    An incoming attribute is remapped to color according to the
    	    provided ramp.
    Color:
        This is the color to apply when in Constant mode.
    Seed:
        This is the random number seed for the Random mode.

    Attribute:
	The attribute to be remapped into color.   If it is a single float, it
	is indexed directly into the ramp.  If it is more than one float, each
	component is remapped independently.

    Range:
	The incoming range of valid attribute values.  Attribute values within
	this range will be remapped to 0-1 for the ramp lookup, values outside
	will be clamped.
