= UV Edit =

"""Lets you interactively move UVs in the texture view."""

UV Edit allows interactive editing of the UVs on the source geometry.
Multiple edits can be made within a single UV Edit operation.

The UV Edit operation will automatically detect whether the input geometry uses primitive, point, edges, or vertex UV attributes, and will affect these attributes appropriately.

3D transforms are allowed in the UV Edit operation, as the UV attribute
is actually 3 coordinates: U, V, and W. When used interactively,
translates and scales are along the U/V axes while rotations are about
the W axis.

The UV Edit operation is cumulative, meaning that several operations can
be performed within a single node in the network. UV Edit is not
animatable. To animate UV transformations, use UV Transform or other UV
deformers.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to apply current operation to.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
    Transform Order:
        Order in which transformations occur.
    Rotate Order:
        Order in which rotations occur.
    Translate:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Amount of translation along uvw axes.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Amount of rotation about uvw axes.
    Scale:
        #channels: /sx /sy /sz

        Non-uniform scaling along uvw axes.
    Shear:
        Amount of shearing. The three values represent U on UV plane, U
        on UW plane, and V on VW plane respectively.
    Pivot:
        #channels: /px /py /pz

        Local pivot point for transformations.
    Soft Radius:
        #channels: /rad

        Area of influence.
    Soft Type:
        Type of rolloff function.
    Tangent Angles:
        #channels: /tandeg

        Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first value
        applies to the tangent farthest from the source point, the
        second applies to the tangent closest to the source point.
    Kernel Function:
        [Metaball
        kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]  to use
        when rolloff Type is "Meta-ball"
    Metric:
        Measure of distance to use when performing a soft transform.
    Ignore Point Connectivity:
        Affect only points connected to the points in the group, or all
        points within the radius.
    Ignore UV Connectivity:
        Affect only vertices connected to the vertices in the group as
        seen in the UV viewport.
    Visualize Falloff:
        When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
        or vertex attribute.

        Never:
            Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
        Always:
            Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
        When Viewport Tool Is Active:
            Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
            when the viewport tool for this node is active.
    Sew Vertices with Shared Points:
        Transform the vertex UVs on the selected edges such that the
        vertices with shared points will also share the same UV values.
        This option is only available for vertex UVs and edge
        selections. When the edge selection does not contain a specific
        primitive, a target is chosen among the primitives sharing the
        edge, otherwise the target will be the primitive specified in the
        edge group. When multiple edges from multiple patches are
        specified, the patches with the most number of edges specified
        in the edge group will be the target patches.
    Start New UV Transform:
        Begin a new UV Transform. Keep all changes, but reset the
        operation parameters.
    Reset All Changes:
        Discard all changes made while using this SOP, and reset the
        operation parameters.
