= VEX SOP =

"""References a VEX program that can manipulate point attributes."""

This node references a (textual) VEX program which can use SOP
context [VEX functions|/vex/functions] to manipulate attributes on
geometry points. (To define a VOP network instead of a VEX program,
use the [VOP SOP|Node:sop/vopsop] instead.)

See [creating a VEX surface node type|/vex/sopnodes] for information
on how to write the VEX program.

This node is for "one-off" programs to manipulate
geometry in a single surface network. To use a VEX program to
define a _reusable_ surface node type, see [creating a VEX
surface node type|/vex/sopnodes].

@parameters

Group:
    If you enter the name of a point group in the first input geometry in
    this parameter, only the points in that group will be affected by
    the VEX program.
    
Script:
    Path to the _compiled_ VEX program. You must use [vcc|/vex/vcc] to
    compile your source code and point this node to the compiled file.
    
Number of threads:
    The number of separate threads to use to evaluate the points.
    The default is no threading.

    Since Houdini evaluates the VEX program for each point in the input
    geometry, it can benefit greatly from threading on a multi-processor
    or multi-core machine.
    
Reload VEX functions:
    Reloads the referenced compiled VEX file.
