= Vertex Split =

"""Takes a vertex attribute and splits any point whose vertices differ
by more than a specified tolerance at that attribute."""

For each point in the input geometry, Vertex Split tests the specified
attribute to see if it is within tolerance on each vertex sharing that
point. For each group of vertices outside the tolerance, a new point
will be created. The vertex attribute can then be optionally promoted to
a point attribute.

This operation is useful for promoting vertex attributes to point
attributes without either creating a lot of points or destroying the
seams in the vertex attributes.


@parameters
    Group:
        The point group to act on.
    Attribute:
        The name of the vertex attribute to perform the test on.
    Tolerance:
        #channels: /tol

        The maximum error in any dimension of the attribute before it
        will be split.
    Promote to Point Attribute:
        Whether to promote the attribute to a point attribute.
