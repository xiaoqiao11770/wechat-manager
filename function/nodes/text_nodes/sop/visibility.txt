= Visibility =

"""Shows/hides primitives in the 3D viewer and UV editor."""

This operator changes the visibility of primitives (such as polygons) in
the viewer. It is similar to the nondestructive hide/show functionality
in other modeling and illustration software. You can use this node to
hide part of a model to get it "out of the way" while you work on
another part.

Unlike other packages where you use a menu command to hide polygons and
then another to show them again, the Visibility SOP is part of the
network, so to show hidden polygons again you can just delete or bypass
the Visibility node.

Because this operator only changes the visibility of the primitives,
topology, point numbers, primitive numbers, and so on are not affected.

NOTE:
    This operator does not affect rendering. It only changes the
    visibility of primitives in the viewer.

@parameters
    Group:
        A subset of primitives to hide/show.

    Action:
        #channels: /action

        Sets the visibility of the input primitives.


        Hide primitives:
            Hide the input primitives in the viewer.
        Expose primitives:
            Show the input primitives in the viewer.
    Apply to:
        #channels: /applyto

        Controls whether this operator hides/shows the input primitives,
        or all other primitives _except_ the input primitives.


        Selected primitives:
            Hide/show the input primitives.
        Non-selected primitives:
            Hide/show all other primitives.
    Apply Cumulatively:
        #channels: /cumulative

        Applies the changes to visibility without changing the current
        visibility of unaffected input primitives. If this option is
        off, all visibility is reset according to the options above.

        For example, say primitive 2 was hidden in the input geometry
        and this node hides primitive 5. If this option is on, both
        primitives 2 and 5 will be hidden in the output. If this option
        is off, only primitive 5 will be hidden.
