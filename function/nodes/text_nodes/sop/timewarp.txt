= Time Warp =

"""Retimes the input to a different time range."""

The Time Warp SOP makes it straight forward to extract a time range
from the input and map it to a new timerange in the output.  This can
be used to select clips of animation or, with the cycle option,
generate walk cycles.

Note that if the animation is only defined on integer frame values
(for example, a stream of .bgeos read from the File SOP), it may be
necessary to first use the TimeBlend SOP to create the interpolation
subframes.

@parameters
    Input Range:
        The frame range to extract from the input.  Note that this can be
        fractional.
    Output Range:
        The frame range to scale the input range to.  When the current 
        frame is the first value in the output range, the input will
        be cooked at the first value in the input range.
    Pre Extend:
        The rule for evaluating frames that occur before the output
        range.  Hold will clamp to the output range, Extend will
        linearly extend the input range, and Cycle will repeat the
        input range.
    Post Extend:
        The rule for evaluating frames that occur after the output
        range.  Hold will clamp to the output range, Extend will
        linearly extend the input range, and Cycle will repeat the
        input range.
