"""Copies groups between two pieces of geometry,
based on point/primitive numbers."""

Group Copy copies primitive, point, and edge groups between two
pieces of geometry based on their primitive, point, and edge indices.

New destination groups are created with the same names as their source
group counterparts. The names can have an optional prefix. If a group in
the destination selection shares the same name as the proposed name then
a number of methods are available to resolve the conflict. The transfer
process can be skipped for that particular group in conflict, the
existing group can be overwritten, or a numerical suffix can be appended
to the name of the new destination group. The suffix starts at 2 and
increments by 1 until a unique name is found.

@parameters
Primitive Groups:
    Source primitive groups to copy.  Leaving this empty is equivalent
    to `*`.
    
Primitive Group Prefix:
    Destination primitive group name prefix.
    
Point Groups:
    Source point groups to copy.  Leaving this empty is equivalent to `*`.
    
Point Group Prefix:
    Destination point group name prefix.

Edge Groups:
    Source edge groups to copy. Leaving this empty is equivalent to `*`.

Edge Group Prefix:
    Destination edge group name prefix.

Group Name Conflict:
    Methods to resolve destination group name conflicts.

    Skip Group:
        Conflicted source group not transferred.
    Overwrite:
        Already existing group overwritten.
    Add Suffix:
        Unique numerical suffix added.

Copy Empty Groups:
    Determines if empty groups should be created. If a group has no
    corresponding primitives, points, or edges, it will be empty. If this is
    not chosen, the group will be suppressed. This can be useful to
    limit the number of active groups when extracting a piece of an
    object. However, if one has a dynamic group one is using later
    in the network, and that dynamic group may occasionally be
    empty, it is important to have Copy Empty Groups turned on or
    the later SOPs will be broken.
