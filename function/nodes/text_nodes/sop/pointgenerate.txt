"""Creates new points, optionally based on point positions in the input geometry."""

This node has several modes of operation.

* When the input is not connected,
  generate a certain number of points at the origin.

* Create extra points for each point in the input geometry.

* Use an attribute on each input point as the probability of
  generating new points from that point.

@parameters

Group:
    The point group in the input geometry from which to generate points.
    Leave this blank to use all points in the input.

Keep Original Geometry:
    Do not delete the original input points.

Compute Number of Points:
    Ignore __Number of points__ and instead base the number of generated points
    on the number of input points using __Points per point__.
    Only available when the node's input is connected.

Number of Points:
    The total number of points to generate.
    When __Compute number of points__ is on, this is ignored.

Points Per Point:
    When __Compute number of points__ is on,
    the number of points to generate for each input point.
    This can be modified by the __Generate from attribute__ parameter.

Generate From Attribute:
    The name of a point attribute.
    If __Compute Number of Points__ is on, this attribute will act
    as a per-point scale on the __Points Per Point__ parameter.
    If __Compute Number of Points__ is off, the attribute value should
    be in the range `0-1` and is the probability that an input point
    will generate a new output point.

Random Seed:
    The random seed to use when generating points.

Generated Points Group:
    The name of a group to add the generated points to.

Point Number Attribute:
    For each generated point,
    the node will store the original point number in this attribute.

Point Index Attribute:
    Store the index number of the generated point in this attribute.
    
    For example, if 20 points are generated from a particular input point,
    this value will range from 0 to 19 on the generated points.

Copy Source Attributes:
    Copy attributes from the input points to the generated points.

Source Attributes:
    Only copy attributes whose names match this pattern.
    The default `*` copies all attributes.
    You can replace this with a list of attribute names,
    for example `v pscale age`.
