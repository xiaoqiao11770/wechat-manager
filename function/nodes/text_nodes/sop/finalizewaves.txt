"""Imparts wave velocities to points in waveform geometry"""

This operation is used in the creation of Particle Fluid waves.  Given a 
group of points created from geometry affected by one or more 
[Waveform|Node:sop/waveform] operators, Finalize Waves sets appropriate 
velocities for each point.

A Waveform operator's __Output Wave Velocity Attributes__ option must
be enabled in order for a subsequent Finalize Waves operator to have 
the desired effect.

The Waveform operator does not generate a volume of points on its own.
Once a surface has been modeled as desired using Waveform operators,
using [Extrude Volume|Node:sop/extrudevolume] and then
[Points From  Volume|Node:sop/pointsfromvolume] will create a set of points that Finalize
Waves can act on.  These points can then be used to create a
[Particle Fluid Object|Node:dop/particlefluidobject] that behaves as a wave.

Finalize Waves has no parameters.  All relevant information needed for
imparting the appropriate point velocities is derived from previous
Waveform operators.  This is accomplished by means of attributes created
when a Waveform's __Output Wave Velocity Attributes__ option is enabled.
