"""Creates smooth bridging geometry between two curves or surfaces."""

Filleting creates a new primitive between each input pair and never
affects the original shapes.
This is in contrast to [Join |Node:sop/join] and [Stitch|Node:sop/stitch].
The [Join SOP|Node:sop/join] converts and possibly changes the connected ends of
primitives, and stitching changes the original shapes but does not
change the number of resulting primitives.

Please refer to the [Align SOP|Node:sop/align] for a discussion of
"left" and "right" primitives as well as the option of an auxiliary
input.

NOTE:
    Trim curves are not taken into account by a fillet. To do this, use
    the [Join SOP|Node:sop/join].

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of geometry to fillet.

Fillet:
    Allows filleting of subgroups of N primitives or patterns of
    primitives.

N:
    #id: inc

    Pattern to fillet.

Direction:
    Allows filleting in either U or V.

Fillet Type:
    Type of fillet to create.

    Freeform:
        User controlled.
    Convex:
        Flips the spans to keep the fillet convex.
    Circular:
        Adjust tangent lengths to keep the fillet circular.

Primitive Type:
    Type of geometry to create fillet from.

Order:
    #id: order

    Order of splines.

Left UV:
    #id: leftuv

    Point on each left primitive at which to begin the fillet.

Right UV:
    #id: rightuv

    Point on each right primitive at which to end the fillet.

LR Width:
    #id: lrwidth

    Proportion of the left end of the fillet spanned. - Proportion
    of the right end of the fillet spanned./lrwidth2

LR Scale:
    #id: lrscale

    Controls the direction and position of the fillet.

LR Offset:
    #id: lroffset

    First and last edges of the fillet.

Match input to fillets:
    Inputs are modified so that isoparms appear continuous from one
    primitive to the other. All primitives become the same type and
    order.

Cut Primitives:
    Primitives are trimmed at the edge of the fillet.
