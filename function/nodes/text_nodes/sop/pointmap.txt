= Point Map =

"""A VEX node that generates points based on the luminance of a texture map."""

This SOP scatters points based on the luminance of the texture map parameter. The `Cd` attribute of the point will be set to the color of the map. The `uv` attribute will be set to the texture coordinates corresponding to the pixel of the map chosen.

@parameters

Point Group:
    The point group to which to apply displacement.

Number of Threads:
    Number of processors to use in computation.
    
Edit VEX Function:
    Invoke editor on VEX source code.

Image Map:
    Texture map to scatter points onto.

Maximum Trials:
    To prevent endless looping on black maps, increase this value to get a more accurate representation when your map is mostly black.
    
Random Seed:
    A random number seed that changes the random distribution.
