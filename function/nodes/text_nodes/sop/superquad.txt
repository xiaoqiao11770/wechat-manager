= Super Quad =

"""Generates an isoquadric surface."""

Generates an isoquadric surface. This produces a spherical shape that is
similar to a metaball, with the difference that it doesn't change it's
shape in response to what surrounds it. You can change the XY Exponent
of an isoquadric surface to define it to be more "squarish" or "starish"
in shape. Also, an isoquadric surface is always defined as a polygonal
or mesh type geometry.


@parameters
    Primitive Type:
        Type of geometry to create.
    Connectivity:
        How the surface should be created.
    Radius:
        #channels: /radx /rady /radz

        Radii along xyz axes.
    Center:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Offset of center from object center.
    Orientation:
        Determines pole axis for iso surface.
    Rows:
        #channels: /rows

        Number of rows used in superquad.
    Columns:
        #channels: /cols

        Number of columns used in superquad.
    XY Exponent:
        #channels: /expxy

        The exponent used along the x and y axes.
    Z Exponent:
        #channels: /expz

        Exponent in the z direction.
    Multiple Points Per Pole:
        Determines whether points at the poles are shared or are
        individual to the columns
    Cusp Polygons:
        Makes vertices unique, causing the superquad to be faceted.
    Cusp Angle:
        Minimum angle in degrees between adjacent surfaces for which
        cusping will occur.
