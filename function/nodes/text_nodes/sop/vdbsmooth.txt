"""Smooths out the values in a VDB volume primitive."""

[Include:volume_types]

For each voxel, this node computes an average (see the __Operation__ parameter) from the surrounding values and sets the voxel to that average.
(The "surrounding area" is a cube, despite the name __Filter Voxel Radius__).

NOTE:
    To smooth an SDF, use [VDB Smooth SDF|Node:sop/vdbsmoothsdf].

@parameters

Group:
    The name of VDB primitive(s) in the input to be smoothed.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Alpha Mask:
    #id: maskname
    If enabled, it will use the second input's VDB for alpha masking. Assumes
    voxel values are between 0 to 1 inclusive.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.

Operation:
    How to smooth the voxel values.

    Mean Value:
        Find the mean (`total/count`) of the surrounding values.
        This is equivalent to a box blur of the same radius.
    
    Median Value:
        Find the median (middle value) of the surrounding values.
        This is useful for de-spiking noisy data as extreme values will not contribute to the final result.

Filter Voxel Radius:
    #id: radius
    
    The number of voxels to run the smooth operation over.
    This is measured in voxels, not distance.
    This distance defines a _cube_, so increasing the "radius" will exponentially increase the work.

Iterations:
    Number of times to repeat the smoothing operation.

    For a cone blur, multiply the radius by `0.454545` and use two passes.
    For a gaussian, multiply the radius by `0.33` and use four passes.

[Include:vdbrenormalizesdf#accuracy]

Invert Alpha Mask:
    #id: invert
    Inverts the alpha mask so that values from 0-1 maps to 1-0.
    
Min Mask Cutoff:
    #id: minmask
    Alpha mask values below this are mapped to 0.

Max Mask Cutoff:
    #id: maxmask
    Alpha mask values above this are mapped to 1.
