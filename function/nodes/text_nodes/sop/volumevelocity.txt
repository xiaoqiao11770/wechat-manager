= Volume Velocity =

"""Computes a velocity volume."""

The Volume Velocity operator adds a procedural velocity field to the input
volumes.  Three volumes together define a velocity field, one for each of the x, y, and z components.  The [Volume SOP|Node:sop/volume] can be used to create three properly named volumes using the Vector option.

@inputs

Velocity Volumes:
        The volume primitives to add a velocity field to.
Points:
    Points to sample velocity values from.
Mask:
    The velocity will be zeroed out outside this masked area.

@parameters

Group:
    The volumes to add to.  The first three are the x, y, and z components
    respectively for adding velocity values to.

Add Uniform Velocity:
    Controls whether a constant velocity will be added or not.
    
Constant Velocity:
    A uniform velocity added everywhere in the velocity field.

== Vortex ==

Add Vortex:
    A vortex field is a velocity field that spins around an axis, like a
    spinning tornado.
    
Center:
    The origin of the spinning vortex.
    
Direction:
    The axis around which the velocity field will spin.
    
Angular Velocity:
    How fast the velocity field spins.  This is how fast the velocity field
    will be one unit away from the center.
    
Vortex Radius:
    Instead of having the vortex affect the entire space, it can be
    constrained to only operate in a tube around the axis.  This is the
    radius of that tube.
    
Vortex Ramp:
    To avoid a sudden change in velocity at the edge of the vortex, this
    ramp describes a speed multiplier of the vortex from the center to the
    edge of the vortex.

== Curl Noise ==

Add Curl Noise:
    Curl noise is a special type of noise that describes a velocity field
    that doesn't contract or expand.  Particles that move through
    it will keep a uniform density.
    
Scale:
    Strength of the noise field.
    
Swirl Size:
    The size of the biggest swirls induced by the noise.
    
Grain:
    The relative strength of each successively smaller band of swirls.
    
Offset:
    A noise offset, useful for seeding different noises.
    
Attenuation:
    The strength of each band is raised to this power, resulting in a
    contrast like effect within that band.
    
Turbulence:
    The number of octaves of swirls to add up.  Note that adding swirls
    that are smaller than your voxel size will no longer have a meaningful
    effect.  Swirl Size / (2^turbulence) should be twice the voxel size.
    Adding more layers of turbulence increases computation cost while just
    adding white noise to the field.
    
Time Dependent:
    Controls if the velocity is animated over time.
    
Pulse Length:
    In this length of time, measured in seconds, the noise will transition
    into an entirely new arrangement.
    
Frame Offset:
    A start frame offset to the time, measured in frames.

== Points ==

Add Point Velocity:
    Adds point velocity by extrapolating the velocity attribute of the
    second input's points.
    
Points:
    The subset of points to use as an extrapolation source.
    
Attribute:
    Which attribute to copy into the volumes.  Should be a three float
    attribute representing velocities.
    
Scale:
    The extrapolated velocity will be multiplied by this scale, making it
    easy to provide an overall boost to the source velocity.
    
Extrapolation Distance:
    How far away from the points to still apply their velocity values.
    This is a distance measure.
    
== From Object ==

Add Object Motion:
    This adds in the frame-to-frame motion of an Object node to the
    velocity field.  This is useful for inheriting the motion of things
    animated at the object level.  

    SOP transforms are not included in this. The [Extract Transform Object|Node:obj/extractgeo] can be used to bring SOP transforms (such as from a disk sequence) into the object level.
        
Object Path:
    The object node to extract a transform from.
    
Scale:
    The object's velocity can be boosted by this constant scale.
    
Frame:
    When to sample the object's position.  This is the center of the sample time.
    
Frame Sample:
    What time interval to extract the objects transform over. This is the
    total interval. So the object will be evaluated at
    `Frame - (Frame Sample)/2` and at `Frame + (Frame Sample)/2`,
    and these two transforms compared to derive the velocity of the
    object.

== Mask ==

Apply Mask:
    The third input's volume can be used to zero out parts of the velocity field.  Doing so allows empty areas to be compressed as constant tiles, reducing memory usage and disk space of the resulting fields.
    
Mask Volumes:
    The volume to use for masking.
    
Expansion:
    A dilation of the volume, through a maximum function, is performed for
    this distance.  This is a distance measure.
    
Comparison:
    Voxels that are kept will be those that match this comparison
    operation.
    
Cut Off:
    The value that mask values are compared against to see if they area
    kept.
