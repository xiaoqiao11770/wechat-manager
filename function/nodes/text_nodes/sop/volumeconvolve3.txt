= Volume Convolve 3x3x3 =

"""Convolves a volume by a 3x3x3 kernel."""

The Volume Convolve 3x3x3 operation convolves the voxels of a volume.

This takes each 3x3x3 neighbourhood of a voxel, multiplies it by a set of
coefficients, and combines the result into a total.  This can be used as a
basic primitive for doing edge detection or neighbourhood counting.

@parameters
    Source Group:
        The volume primitives to be convolved.
    Z-1, Z=0, Z+1 Kernel:
	The coefficients for the 3x3x3 neighbourhood are split into separate
	3x3 arrays, specifying the x/y coefficients for each z-plane.
    Normalize Kernel:
	The coefficients will be divided by the average of all of the
	coefficients, resulting in an operation that preserves magnitude.
    Combine Operation:
	How to combine the voxels after they've been multiplied by the
	coefficients.  Add Abs will take the absolute value of each
	voxel-coeffecient product prior to adding them up.
