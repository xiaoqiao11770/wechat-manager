= Platonic Solids =

"""Creates platonic solids of different types."""

Platonic solids are polyhedrons which are convex and have all the
vertices and faces of the same type. There are only five such objects,
which form the first five choices of this operation.

The Utah Teapot has a long history in Computer Graphics which has led to
it being nominated as the sixth Platonic Solid.

NOTE:
    The geometry created by this node is not "solid"
    in the sense of a solid modeler.
