"""Deforms the points in the first input using one or more magnets
from the second input."""

The "magnetic field" of influence is defined by a metaball field.

This node is a simpler version of the [Magnet node|Node:sop/magnet].

[Include:/shelf/bulge#includeme]

@parameters
    Deform Group:
        Geometry to be deformed with the magnet.
    Magnet Group:
        Magnet primitives in the 2nd input.
    Deform Group Type:
        The type of geometry to deform.
    Magnitude:
        #channels: /mag

        Scaling factor for point displacement.
    Normalize Weight:
        Normalize the displacement vector from the metaball origin to
        the point.
