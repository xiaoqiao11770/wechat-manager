= Unpaste =

"""The Unpaste op removes one or more pasted surfaces from a paste
hierarchy, causing the hierarchy to update."""

The Unpaste op removes one or more pasted surfaces from a paste
hierarchy, causing the hierarchy to update. It can keep either the
unpasted surfaces or what remains pasted in the hierarchy after the
removal of the unpasted surfaces.

The op accepts both pasted surfaces and entire paste hierarchies as
inputs. For example, to turn a paste hierarchy into a set of unrelated
surfaces, enter the hierarchy number in the Group field.

By preserving the hierarchical structure of the unpasted surfaces, the
resulting sub-hierarchy can be reapplied properly to another hierarchy
later on.

The shape and the size of the sub-hierarchy may change considerably as a
result of the unpasting operation. This is because the feature surfaces
are always mapped onto the domain of the base surface, and the size of
the domain is completely unrelated to the size of the actual surface.

By unpasting the root of the paste hierarchy the whole hierarchy becomes
undone.

== Unpasted Surface Hierarchies ==

    An unpasted surface or sub-hierarchy can be repasted later with the
    [Paste SOP|Node:sop/paste]. One case of repasting is worth
    mentioning for its practical use.

    Assume you have used the Paste op to spawn a new surface as a detail
    added to the base surface. Now you are ready to model the new
    feature. You can do so by working on the pasted feature, making sure
    to affect only its points and not the points of the base surface as
    well. If the point density of the model is high, it may be more
    convenient to model the feature separately, then re-attach it to the
    paste hierarchy as if it had never been removed.

    There are three easy steps to achieve this goal:

    Use the Unpaste op with the default parameters: keep the unpasted
    part and preserve the shape of the feature together with its
    hierarchical information. Make sure to specify the feature's
    primitive number in the Group field. Notice the shape of the feature
    has not changed.

    Model the stand-alone feature with Houdini's vast array of tools.

    Repaste the feature on the same base surface using the "As Is" tab
    with shape preservation enabled.
