"""Duplicates and mirrors geometry across a mirror plane."""

The Mirror Operation duplicates and mirrors geometry. If the point
normal attribute exists, it is also mirrored for each point. Quadrics
and pasted surfaces are also supported.

[Include:/shelf/mirror#includeme]

@parameters

Group:
    Primitives to mirror

Origin:
    Origin of mirror plane

Distance:
    #id: dist

    Distance of mirror plane along its normal

Direction:
    Normal direction of mirror plane

Reverse Normals:
    Reverses the normals of the mirrored geometry. Reverse U and
    Reverse V options apply only to mesh-type primitives (such as
    NURBS surfaces for example).

Keep Original:
    Preserves the input geometry. If unchecked, only the selected
    geometry will remain.

Consolidate Seam:
    Consolidates points along the mirror. New points are only
    consolidated with their mirrored counterpart.
