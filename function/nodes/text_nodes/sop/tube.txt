= Tube =

"""Creates open or closed tubes, cones, or pyramids."""

Create cones by entering a value of zero for either the top or bottom
radius in the Parameters.

@parameters

        Primitive Type:
            The type of geometry to be created.
        Connectivity:
            How the surface of the tube is constructed.
        Orientation:
            Primary axis of the tube.
        End Caps:
            Creates end caps on the tube.
        Consolidate Corner Points:
            When enabled, end caps will share points with the sides of the tube,
            if __Primitive Type__ is set to Polygon or Polygon Soup.
        Add Vertex Normals:
            Adds vertex normals to the tube, so that it will have an explicit
            cusped appearance.

        Center:
            #channels: /tx /ty /tz

            Offset of tube center from object origin.
        Radius:
            #channels: /rad1 /rad2

            Top and bottom radii of the tube.
	Radius Scale:
	    #channels: /scalerad

	    Uniform scale for the radius.
        Height:
            #channels: /height

            The height of the tube.

        Rows:
            #channels: /rows

            Number of rows in tube.
        Columns:
            Number of columns in tube.
        U Order:
            #channels: /orderu

            Order of NURBS/Bezier curve in U direction.
        V Order:
            #channels: /orderv

            Order of NURBS/Bezier curve in V direction.
        Imperfect:
            Approximates surface using non-rational points.
